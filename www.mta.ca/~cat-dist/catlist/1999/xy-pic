Subject: New release of XY-pic diagram drawing macros 

Date: Thu, 9 Jun 1994 17:42:43 +0200
From: kris@diku.dk

Dear fellow diagram drawers and TeX users!

This is to announce the release of a new version of my DIAGRAM DRAWING
PACKAGE, XY-pic: version 2.9.  In particular this version represents
the stage where XY-pic 3 has left ALPHA test (and entered BETA
confidence test) and the kernel should be stable.

The release is mainly a BUG FIX RELEASE fixing several problems
reported in version 2.7 and 2.8 by users; in addition it ADDS THESE
NEW FEATURES:

* The speed of diagram typesetting has been increased back closer to
  the version 2.6 speed, faster for very large diagrams.

* The set up of the style of \arrow command must now be clearly
  marked.

* It is possible to `compile' large diagrams (with some restrictions)
  to a file such that retypesetting is faster still.

* Options can now be loaded safely in any order.

* The bug that required removal of \\ before \enddiagram has been
  fixed.

* The PostScript backend by Ross Moore has been greatly enhanced and
  now supports varying line thickness, colour, rotation, and scaling.

* There is a new feature by Ross Moore: \xyoption{2cell} loads special
  commands typesetting pairs and triples of curved arrows like
  categorical two-cells.

Below I have attached the TRAILER of the package that gives some more
details and explains how to obtain it; the version packaged specially
for the Apple Macintosh by Ross Moore will be available shortly.

Regards,

======================================================================
TRAILER: ANNOUNCING the XY-pic version 2.9 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
======================================================================

XY-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
within TeX that works with most formats (including LaTeX 2.09, LaTeX2e,
AMS-LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and plain TeX).  In particular XY-pic is provided
as a LaTeX2e `package'.

NOTE: version 2.9 is a final BETA CONFIDENCE TEST release of XY-pic 3
in the sense that it is likely to contain minor bugs in both
documentation and code but should be stable.  If you are a user of an
earlier version of XY-pic then PLEASE TEST this release with your
existing diagrams and REPORT PROBLEMS you encounter to the authors!

The intention remains to maintain full backwards compatibility with
XY-pic 2 but we need feed-back from users in order to achieve this
goal (see `The future and backwards compatibility' in the User's Guide
for the unavoidable exceptions).

Version 2.9 is the final result of the effort this springs to outline
XY-pic 3 in collaboration with Ross Moore while visiting Macquarie U,
Sydney: The package has been restructured and extended into a kernel
and several orthogonal modules and is now ready for the implementation
of several independent `specialist' modes for convenient typesetting
of Graphs and Trees, 2-cells, String and braid diagrams, etc. (some
are already under construction).

Below I discuss the main features of XY-pic and how it is available.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 2.9 FEATURES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

XY-pic version 2.9 provides two modes of specifying drawings:

* A matrix-like mode where the dimensions of the drawing are
  automatically computed by aligning diagram entries in rows and
  columns (this is also the `version 2 compatibility mode').

* A general `turtle graphic' drawing language for specifying graphs
  with objects and connections between them in a manner independent of
  orientation.

Both modes support the following specific features:

+ Positions can be given in variety of formats (extendable) including
  user defined coordinates (x,y) and relative to previous positions,
  objects, object edges, and points on connections.

+ Objects may be circular or rectangular (more shapes can be added)
  and adjusted in several ways.

+ Large library of objects with mnemonic names.

+ Objects that orient themself along a connection when placed relative
  to it, e.g., `\dir{|-}' is like \vdash but thus oriented; new such
  objects can be defined in a convenient way.

+ Includes circle segments and arbitrary TeX text.

+ Connections are aligned between the reference points of objects but
  start and end on the edges.

+ Any object can be used to build a connection (using `diagonal
  filling'); library objects provide common line types.

+ Special notation for drawing arrows with tail, stem, and head build
  from any object(s).  Special support for arrows that cross each
  other, arrows that `go by' other entries, combined arrows, and
  arrows with n/8 bends.

+ Library of frames.

+ NEW: Special notation for rotation, scaling, colour, and line
  thickness.  The correct typesetting of these features requires a
  backend that supports it (i.e., PostScript) but even when PostScript
  is not available XY-pic tries to approximate what is requested.

+ Output can use PostScript for drawing (several \special formats are
  supported: dvips, dvitops, Textures, and OzTeX -- more are being
  added continuously: contact Ross Moore <ross@mpce.mq.edu.au> for the
  current list).  Notation for inclusion of literal PostScript.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear CATEGORY THEORY COMMUNITY,

This is to announce a BUG FIX release of my DIAGRAM DRAWING PACKAGE,
XY-pic: version 2.10.  It fixes the following user visible bugs in
version 2.9:

* Very high of wide labels were not placed correctly on diagonal
  arrows by the `arrow' feature and in compatibility mode (thanks to
  Clemens Beckstein for finding this).

* Colouring of labels (using the `color' extension) now works!

I'm sorry for releasing so soon after the last release but the bugs
were classed `important'.

Please retrieve the new version by anonymous ftp from

  ftp.diku.dk :         /diku/users/kris/TeX
  ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au :  /pub/maths/TeX

or the CTAN `macros/generic/diagrams/xypic' mirror which will be up to
date in a day or so.

Dear CATEGORY THEORY COMMUNITY,

[Thank you for all the positive replies ... so this time I'll only ask
 those who do NOT wish news about XY-pic or who get it from other
 sources to send me an email saying so :-]

This is to announce yet another BUG FIX release of my DIAGRAM DRAWING

Subject: ANNOUNCE: XY-pic version 2.12 released...
Date: Tue, 25 Oct 1994 13:17:10 +0100
From: kris@diku.dk

Dear category theorist,

This is to announce yet another BUG FIX release of my DIAGRAM DRAWING
PACKAGE, XY-pic: version 2.12.  It fixes the following user visible
bugs in version 2.11:

* No conflict with `AMS-LaTeX' version 1.2 (SEE BELOW).

* No conflict with Karl Berry's `eplain' (SEE BELOW).

* Curves with explicit control are now right [Sjoerd Crans].

* Directional vectors no longer invalidate the Xy-state [Luc van Eycken].

* Tips on zero-sized turns no longer reversed [Jorge Almeida].

* Curves no longer overlap the surrounding text.

* Numerous documentation fixes in the Reference Manual.

* Short steep segments now placed correctly [thanks, Ross].

I am sorry to announce this very interim version which is necessary
because of a change in an internal function of AMS-LaTeX [sic].  Thus

      ** PLEASE UPDATE TO VERSION 2.12 IF YOU USE AMS-LaTeX ***

The release of the `real' version 3 (no longer in beta-test) is
imminent so you need not update otherwise unless any of the other bugs
have bothered you (or you desperately need one of the additions
described below).

There is ONE IMPORTANT CHANGE in the v3 extensions of this version:
the \arrow command has been renamed to \ar in order to make diagrams
more concise and avoid conflict with Karl Berry's `eplain', however,
using the `v2' compatibility option will still define \arrow (as well
as \stop and \merge that are also in conflict with existing names on
some systems).

                                - o -

One extension and one feature have been added with this release:

* \xyoption{cmtip} allows the use of arrow tips that resemble those
  of D. Knuth's Computer Modern and Computer Concrete fonts.

* \xyoption{poly} supports drawing of regular polygons (by Ross Moore).

Version 3 will also have a special input mode for `knots and links'.

                                - o -

Xy-pic can be retrieved by anonymous ftp from

  ftp.diku.dk :         /diku/users/kris/TeX/
  ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au :  /pub/maths/TeX/

(see the README file as to the exact location below that), from

  CTAN :                /tex-archive/macros/generic/diagrams/xypic

and also through the World Wide Web (see below).

                                - o -

NEWS: there is now a World Wide Web HOME PAGE for Xy-pic in

  <URL: http://www.diku.dk/users/kris/Xy-pic.html>

which includes pointers to the sources as well as some TUTORIAL PAPERS
on Xy-pic:

* K.Rose: Xy-pic and Notation for Categorical Diagrams.

* R.Moore: Typesetting Neural Nets with Xy-pic.

(for people without WWW access these are also available on the ftp
servers in files xy/papers/ecct-94.ps and xy/papers/NeuralNets.ps).

                                - o -

In the hope that you will like the new things,
                                                Kristoffer Rose

======================================================================
      ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
======================================================================

This is to announce a MAJOR RELEASE of my DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE:

                               Xy-pic 3.0

In particular most features that have been added since version 2.6 are
now sufficiently stable to leave beta-test.

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further details on the package are in the README file of the distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  NEWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic version 3 is a thorough rewrite of the last major version,
version 2 (last version 2 release was release 2.6; several beta-test
releases numbered 2.7-2.12 have been made available to users).  However,
full backwards compatibility is maintained (except for the unavoidable
but fully documented obscure cases).

The package is now structured as a kernel and several orthogonal
modules, in particular there are independent `specialist' modes for
convenient typesetting of components that are structured as graphs,
matrices, polygons, 2-cells, etc.

Finally, version 3 adds the following to what was available in
v2.12/3beta:

* The User's Guide is up to date with v3 features!
* There is a new input mode specially for KNOTS AND LINKS!
* Arbitrary arcs and frames are now properly integtared!
* DVI driver interface greatly simplified!

A few DVI drivers are not quite ready for release which is why this is
v3.0 and there will be a 3.1 including the missing drivers (as well as
the inevitable bug fixes).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                              AVAILABILITY

=======================================================================
     ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3.2 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
=======================================================================

This is to announce a RELEASE of the DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE:

                               Xy-pic 3.2

This is a maintenance release where a few more bugs of the previous
major release of Xy-pic 3 (from July) have been eliminated.

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further details on the package are in the README file of the
distribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  NEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic version 3 is a thorough rewrite of the prior major version,
version 2 (last version 2 release was release 2.6; several beta-test
releases of version 3, numbered 2.7-2.12, were made available to users).
However, full backwards compatibility is maintained (except for the
unavoidable but fully documented obscure cases).

Release 3.2 fixes the following relative to release 3.1:

* Arrow labels now typeset using the correct style in all cases.

* Circles in old-style diagrams now work again...

* PostScript pattern support now compatible with GhostScript.

as well as several minor fixes in code & documentation (all described in
the ChangeLog file in the source distribution).

Thanks to J|rgen Koslowski, Young U. Ryu, Fred T. Krogh, Clemens
Beckstein, and Ralf Gaertner, for your bug reports!

Dear Category Theorists,

Please find enclosed a copy of the TRAILER for a new version of Xy-pic!

Sincerely,
           Kristoffer H. Rose

=======================================================================
    ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3.6 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
=======================================================================

This is to announce a release of my diagram typesetting package Xy-pic.

Version 3.6 contains new and improved PostScript fonts donated by Y&Y
Inc. (as well as several minor bug fixes).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				GENERAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further specifics of the package are in the distribution README file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				 NEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary purpose of release 3.6 is the inclusion of much improved
PostSript fonts courtesy of Y&Y TeX and several Internetwide
volunteers: these make it possible to use Xy-pic output with Windows
(in addition to Macintosh and Un*x), Adobe's ATM software, and to
produce Adobe PDF ("Acrobat") files.

NOTE: This change means that you must REMOVE SOME OLD FONT FILES (the
details of which and how are in the INSTALL file).

Release 3.6 furthermore fixes a few problems of release 3.5:

* frames more robust against disappearing on bogus PostScript printers
* thickness of curves now adjustable
* TDS compliance improved
* bogus `graph escape redefined' message eliminated

Thanks to David Carlisle, John Landamore, Ralph Loader, Thorsten
Schwander, and Timco Visser, for your bug reports, and to Adam
Worrall, Thierry Bouche, Tanmoy Bhattacharya and especially to
Berthold Horn and Louis Vosloo of Y&Y Inc. for their work on the
PostScript fonts.

Finally profound thanks to BRICS and DAIMI for hosting Xy-pic (and
Kristoffer :) for a most productive and enjoyable year!
