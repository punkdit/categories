The publishers have just informed informed me that the above book has been
out of print since sept, 1993, that no stock is available, and that the
copyright reverts to me.

I would consider getting some loose page copies printed and sold if this
seemed economic, and/or if for example there was a desire to use part or all
for course adoption. For the latter I could supply a top copy and allow for
copying to students at a moderate fee per student. Offers welcomed. The aim
is to get the book available and read. The publisher's previous distribution
at 50 pounds sterling discouraged this.

This book has material on groupoids, homotopy types, fundamental groupoid of
orbit spaces, etc. not available elsewhere.

                        Synopsis

This thesis is an investigation into axiomatic categorical domain
theory as needed for the denotational semantics of deterministic
programming languages.

To provide a direct semantic treatment of non-terminating computations,
we make partiality the core of our theory. Thus, we focus on categories
of partial maps. We study representability of partial maps and show its
equivalence with classifiability. We observe that, once partiality is
taken as primitive, a notion of approximation may be derived. In fact,
two notions of approximation, contextual approximation and
specialisation, based on testing and observing partial maps are
considered and shown to coincide. Further we characterise when the
approximation relation between partial maps is domain-theoretic in the
(technical) sense that the category of partial maps Cpo-enriches with
respect to it.

Concerning the semantics of type constructors in categories of partial
maps, we present a characterisation of colimits of diagrams of total
maps; study order-enriched partial cartesian closure; and provide
conditions to guarantee the existence of the limits needed to solve
recursive type equations. Concerning the semantics of recursive types,
we motivate the study of enriched algebraic compactness and make it the
central concept when interpreting recursive types. We establish the
fundamental property of algebraically compact categories, namely that
recursive types on them admit canonical interpretations, and show that
in algebraically compact categories recursive types reduce to inductive
types. Special attention is paid to Cpo-algebraic compactness, leading
to the identification of a 2-category of kinds with very strong closure
properties.

As an application of the theory developed, enriched categorical models
of the metalanguage FPC (a type theory with sums, products,
exponentials and recursive types) are defined and two abstract examples
of models, including domain-theoretic models, are axiomatised. Further,
FPC is considered as a programming language with a call-by-value
operational semantics and a denotational semantics defined on top of a
categorical model. Operational and denotational semantics are related
via a computational soundness result. The interpretation of FPC
expressions in domain-theoretic Poset-models is observed to be
representation-independent. And, to culminate, a computational adequacy
result for an axiomatisation of absolute non-trivial domain-theoretic
models is proved.

Friedman's completeness theorem is completeness of beta,eta for
full classical model (i.e., Set). Deductive completeness fails
for Set and for models (interpretations into categories) where
every type (every object named by a type expression) is required
to be non-empty (have a global element). I tried to clarify this
in my book (still to appear). If anyone is seriously interested,
I could email the appropriate sections of the book.

    We show that there is a certain variety (= category tripleable over
sets) and a simple Horn sentence in it of the form phi(u) = phi(v) ==>
psi(u) = psi(v) whose category of models is equivalent to the opposite
of topological spaces.  The theory consists of that of frames together
with a unary operation we denote ' (it is a kind of pseudocomplement)
satisfying a small set of equations plus an equation scheme that forces
all intervals of the form [u /\ u',u \/ u'] to be complete atomic
boolean algebras with the Sup and ' as operations.  The underlying set
functor on Top\op takes a space to the set of all pairs (U,A) where U is
open and A is an arbitrary subset of U. The frame operations are the
usual, while (U,A)' = (U,U - A).  The Horn clause is u \/ u' \/ 1' = v
\/ v' \/ 1' ==> u \/ u' = v \/ v'.

The following preprint is available (by hard mail)

Marco  Grandis, "Homotopical algebra and triangulated categories"
to appear in: Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc.

Abstract
        We study here the connections between the well known Puppe-Verdier
notion of triangulated category and an abstract setting for homotopical
algebra, based on homotopy kernels and cokernels, which was exposed by the
author in two previous papers ["On the categorical foundations of
homological and homotopical algebra", Cahiers Top. Geom. Diff. Categ. 33
(1992), 135-175.  "Homotopical algebra in homotopical categories", Appl.
Categ. Struct., to appear].
        We show that a right-homotopical category  A  (having well-behaved
homotopy cokernels, i.e. mapping cones) has a sort of weak triangulated
structure with regard to the suspension endofunctor Sigma, called
Sigma-homotopical category. If  A  is right- and left-homotopical and
h-stable (in a sense related to the suspension-loop adjunction), also this
structure is h-stable, i.e. satisfies "up to homotopy" the axioms of
Verdier for a triangulated category, excepting the octahedral one which
depends on some further elementary conditions on the cone endofunctor of A.
        Every Sigma-homotopical category can be stabilised, by two
universal procedures, respectively initial and terminal.

This paper contains the work of Moez Alimohamed, a mathematics graduate
student at the University of Pennsylvania who died tragically on August 29th.
Lambda definability is characterized in categorical models of simply typed
lambda calculus with type variables.  A category-theoretic framework known
as glueing or sconing is used to extend the Jung-Tiuryn characterization of
lambda definability in Henkin models for the simply typed lambda calculus
first to ccc models, and then to categorical models of the calculus with
type variables.

               Weakly distributive categories

               by J.R.B. Cockett and R.A.G. Seely

Abstract:

There are many situations in logic, theoretical computer science, and
category theory where two binary operations---one thought of as a (tensor)
``product'', the other a ``sum''---play a key role.  In distributive and
*-autonomous categories these operations can be regarded as, respectively,
the and/or of traditional logic and the times/par of (multiplicative) linear
logic.  In the latter logic, however, the distributivity of product over sum
is conspicuously absent: this paper studies a ``linearization'' of that
distributivity which is present in both case.  Furthermore, we show that
this weak distributivity is precisely what is needed to model Gentzen's cut
rule (in the absence of other structural rules) and can be strengthened in
two natural ways to generate full distributivity and *-autonomous categories.


This is the journal version of the similarly named paper appearing in the
Proceedings of the Durham conference (1991):

to Computer Science, London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series 177
(1992) 45 - 65.

This version is to appear in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.

The paper has been rewritten, including more details and several examples,
including shifted tensors, Span categories, and categories of modules of a

         A Logical View of Concurrent Constraint Programming

Abstract;
The Concurrent Constraint Programming paradigm has been the subject of
growing interest as the focus of a new paradigm for concurrent computation.
Like logic programming it claims close relations to logic.  In fact these
languages _are_ logics in a certain sense that we make precise in this
paper.  In recent work it was shown that the denotational semantics of
determinate concurrent constraint programming languages forms a categorical
structure called a hyperdoctrine, which is used as the basis of the
categorical formulation of first order logic.  What this connection shows
is the combinators of determinate concurrent constraint programming can be
viewed as logical connectives.  In the present work we extend these ideas
to the operational semantics of these languages and thus make available
similar analogies for a much broader variety of languages including the
indeterminate concurrent constraint programming languages and concurrent
block-structured imperative languages.

        CATEGORICAL LOGIC OF CONCURRENCY AND INTERACTION I:
        SYNCHRONOUS PROCESSES
        by Dusko Pavlovic (August 1994)


        Abstract.
This is a report on a mathematician's effort to understand some
concurrency theory. The starting point is a logical interpretation of
Nielsen and Winskel's account of the basic models of concurrency. Upon
the obtained logical structures, we build a calculus of relations
which yields, when cut down by bisimulations, Abramsky's interaction
category of synchronous processes. It seems that all interaction
categories arise in this way. The obtained presentation uncovers some
of their logical contents and perhaps sheds some more light on the
original idea of processes as relations extended in time.

The sequel of this paper will address the issues of asynchronicity,
preemption, noninterleaving and linear logic in the same setting.

The abstracts of the papers follow.


ABSTRACT of "Avoiding the axiom of choice in general category theory",
by M. Makkai, McGill University:

"The notion of anafunctor is introduced.  An anafunctor is, roughly, a
"functor defined up to isomorphism".  Anafunctors have a general
theory paralleling that of ordinary functors; they have natural
transformations, they form categories, they can be composed, etc.
Anafunctors can be saturated, to ensure that any object isomorphic to
a possible value of the anafunctor is also a possible value at the
same argument object.  The existence of anafunctors in situations when
ordinarily one would use choice is ensured without choice; e.g., for a
category which has binary products, but not specified binary products,
the anaversion of the product functor is canonically definable, unlike
the ordinary product functor that needs the axiom of choice. When the
composition functors in a bicategory are changed into anafunctors, one
obtains anabicategories.  In the standard definitions of bicategories
such as the monoidal category of modules over a ring, or the
bicategory of spans in a category with pullbacks, and many others, one
uses choice; the anaversions of these bicategories have canonical
definitions. The overall effect is an elimination of the axiom of
choice, and of non-canonical choices, in large parts of general
category theory. To ensure the Cartesian closed character of the
bicategory of small categories, with anafunctors as 1-cells, one uses
a weak version of the axiom of choice, which is related to A. Blass'
axiom of Small Violations of Choice ("Injectivity, projectivity, and
the axiom of choice", Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 255(1979), 31-59)."



ABSTRACT of "Generalized sketches as a framework for completeness
theorems", by M. Makkai, McGill University:

"A generalized concept of sketch is introduced. Because of their role,
morphisms of (generalized) sketches are called sketch-entailments. A
sketch is said to satisfy a sketch-entailment if the former is
injective relative to the latter in the standard sense; the models of
a set R of sketch-entailments are the sketches satisfying all members
of R . R logically implies a sketch-entailment s if every model of R
is also a model of {s} . A deductive calculus is introduced in which
 s is deducible from R iff R logically implies s (General Completeness
Theorem, GCT).  A large number of examples of kinds of structured
category is presented showing that the structured categories are
selected from among the corresponding generalized sketches as the
models of a set of sketch-entailments. As a consequence, the
sketch-entailments satisfied by all structured categories of a given
kind are exactly the ones that are deducible from a certain, usually
finite, set of axioms. In the finitary case, which is the only one
considered in detail in the paper, the notion of deduction is
effective, and straightforwardly implementable on a computer. One
obtains Specific Completeness Theorems (SCT's), each of which asserts
that the exactness properties (certain kinds of sketch-entailments)
that hold in a specific class of structured categories coincide with
the ones that are deducible from a given set of axioms. Each of these
specific completeness theorems is deduced from the GCT, and a
particular Representation Theorem (RT); RT's are a well-known class of
results in categorical logic. The concepts of Compactness and of
Abstract Completeness are introduced, and shown to correspond to the
same-named concepts in logics in the usual symbolic form, via a
translation between the sketch-based syntax and semantics on the one
hand, and the Tarskian syntax and semantics on the other.  The
sketch-based concepts are available for several logics defined
categorically for which there are no available symbolic
presentations."

A new preprint "On localization and stabilization for factorization
systems", by Carboni, Janelidze, Kelly, and Pare', is available in our ftp
site at the address maths.su.oz.au (= 129.78.68.2), in the directory
sydcat/papers/kelly, under the titles cjkp.dvi or cjkp.ps; there is also
cjkp.tex, but that requires two macros - namely diagrams.tex and
kluwer.sty.

The paper contains new ideas, but also self-contained introductions to
several areas with which some may be unfamiliar: namely factorization
systems, descent theory, Galois theory, Eilenberg's monotone-light
factorization for maps between compact hausdorff spaces, hereditary
torsion theories for abelian categories, the category of finite families
of objects of a given category, and the (separable, purely-inseparable)
factorization for field extensions.

What ways are there of constructing a factorization system (E, M) on a
category C ? One simple one is to start with a full reflective subcategory
X of C, and to take E to consist of the maps inverted by the reflexion. Of
course, this (E, M) doesn't have E pullback-stable except in the special
case where X is a LOCALIZATION of C.

We examine another general process, which leads to an (E, M) with E stable
when it succeeds. We start from ANY factorization system (E, M), and
define new classes thus: a map lies in E' if EACH of its pullbacks lies in
E; and it lies in M* if SOME pullback of it along an effective descent map
lies in M. Note the connexion with Galois theory, in Janelidze's
categorical formulation of it: if the (E, M) we begin with arises as above
from a reflective full subcategory, the class M* consists of what
Janelidze calls the COVERINGS (or, in some contexts, the CENTRAL
EXTENSIONS).

It is not always the case that (E', M*) is a factorization system; we give
necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be so, and apply these to
three major examples: Eilenberg's factorization above, certain
factorizations connected to hereditary torsion theories, and a new
factorization system for finite-dimensional algebras over a field that
generalizes (separable, purely-inseparable) factorization for field
extensions.

        CONVENIENT CATEGORIES OF PROCESSES AND SIMULATIONS
        by Dusko Pavlovic

        Abstract.
We show that irredundant trees, used by Dana Scott in the early
sixties, can be used as canonical representants of the bisimilarity
classes of automata (or of transition systems). Simulations then boil
down to tree morphisms. Along the same lines, the categories of
processes modulo the observational and the branching congruences, with
the suitable simulations as morphisms again, are shown to be
isomorphic with certain subcategories of the category of irredundant
trees.

                     Natural deduction and coherence
                    for weakly distributive categories

                                 by

         R.F. Blute, J.R.B. Cockett, R.A.G. Seely, and T.H. Trimble


ABSTRACT:
This paper examines coherence for certain monoidal categories using
techniques coming from the proof theory of linear logic, in particular
making heavy use of the graphical techniques of proof nets.  We define a two
sided notion of proof net, suitable for categories like weakly distributive
categories which have the two-tensor structure (times/par) of linear logic,
but lack a negation operator.  Representing morphisms in weakly distributive
categories as such nets, we derive a coherence theorem for such categories.
As part of this process, we develop a theory of expansion-reduction systems
with equalities and a term calculus for proof nets, each of which is of
independent interest.  In the symmetric case the expansion reduction system
on the term calculus yields a decision procedure for the equality of maps
for free weakly distributive categories.

The main results of this paper are these.  First we have proved coherence
for the full theory of weakly distributive categories, extending similar
results for monoidal categories to include the treatment of the tensor
units.  Second, we extend these coherence results to the full theory of
*-autonomous categories - providing a decision procedure for the maps of
free symmetric *-autonomous categories.  Third, we derive a conservative
extension result for the passage from weakly distributive categories to
*-autonomous categories.  We show strong categorical conservativity, in the
sense that the unit of the adjunction between weakly distributive and
*-autonomous categories is fully faithful.


NOTES:
This is a significant revision of an earlier version announced a year ago.
The paper has been completely rewritten, and has been enhanced in several
ways:
1) We now treat the cases with non-logical axioms, and with non-commutative
tensor and par, in considerable detail, pointing out in passing where the
traditional treatment (of the pure commutative case) does not work in these
cases.  For example, the traditional proof of sequentiality (via splitting
links) does not work in the presence of non-logical axioms.
2) We develop a term calculus for proof nets, and a theory of expansion -
reduction rewrite systems, both of which are of independant interest.
3) Using this new material has made the proofs clearer and more complete.

The study of topological quantum field theories  increasingly
relies upon concepts from higher-dimensional algebra such as
n-categories and n-vector spaces.   We review progress
towards a definition of n-category suited for this purpose, and
outline a program in which n-dimensional TQFTs are to be
described as n-category representations.   First we describe a
`suspension' operation on n-categories, and hypothesize that
the k-fold suspension of a weak n-category stabilizes for k
greater than or equal to n + 2.  We give evidence for this
hypothesis and describe its relation to stable homotopy theory.
We then propose a description of n-dimensional unitary extended
TQFTs as weak n-functors from the `free stable weak n-category
with duals on one object' to the n-category of `n-Hilbert spaces'.
We conclude by describing n-categorical generalizations of
deformation quantization and the quantum double construction.

                    LINEAR LAUCHLI SEMANTICS

               R. F. Blute             P. J. Scott


We introduce a linear analogue of Lauchli's semantics for
intuitionistic logic. In fact, our result is a strengthening
of Lauchli's work to the level of proofs, rather than
provability. This is obtained by considering continuous actions
of the additive group of integers on a category of topological
vector spaces. The semantics, based on functorial
polymorphism, consists of dinatural transformations which are
equivariant with respect to all such actions. Such dinatural
transformations are called uniform. To any sequent in
Multiplicative Linear Logic (MLL), we associate a vector space
of ``diadditive'' uniform transformations. We then show that this
space is generated by denotations of cut-free proofs of
the sequent in the theory MLL+MIX. Thus we obtain a full
completeness theorem in the sense of Abramsky and Jagadeesan,
although our result differs from theirs in the use of
dinatural transformations.

As corollaries, we show that these dinatural transformations compose,
and obtain a conservativity result: diadditive dinatural transformations
which are uniform with respect to actions of the additive group of
integers are also uniform with respect to the actions of arbitrary
cocommutative Hopf algebras. Finally, we discuss several possible
extensions of this work to noncommutative logic.

It is well known that the intuitionistic version of
Lauchli's semantics is a special case of the theory of logical
relations, due to Plotkin and Statman.
Thus, our work can also be viewed as a first step towards
developing a theory of logical relations for linear
logic and concurrency.

  Abstract
  --------

  Shapely types separate data, represented by lists, from shape, or
  structure. This separation supports shape polymorphism, where
  operations are defined for arbitrary shapes, and shapely operations,
  for which the shape of the result is determined by that of the input,
  permitting static shape checking. The shapely types are closed under
  the formation of fixpoints, and hence include the usual algebraic
  types of lists, trees, etc. They also include other standard data
  structures such as arrays, graphs and records.

Quillen closed model structures for sheaves,
to appear in {\em Journal Pure Appl. Algebra} 100 (1995).

Abstract:
In this paper I give a general procedure of transferring closed model
structures along adjoint functor pairs. As applications I derive from a
global closed model structure on the category of simplicial sheaves
closed model structures on the category of sheaves of 2-groupoids, the
category of bisimplicial sheaves and the category of simplicial sheaves
of groupoids. Subsequently, the homotopy theories of these categories
are related to the homotopy theory of simplicial sheaves.

Pasting presentations for $\omega$-categories.

Abstract:
The pasting theorem showed that pasting schemes are useful in studying
free $\omega$-categories. It was thought that their inflexibility with
respect to composition and identities prohibited wider use. This is not
the case: there is a way of dealing with identities which makes it
possible to describe $\omega$-categories in terms of generating pasting
schemes and relations between generated pastings, \ie{}, with pasting
presentations. In this paper I develop the necessary machinery for
this. The main result, that the $\omega$-category generated by a
pasting presentation is universal with respect to respectable families
of realizations, is a generalization of the pasting theorem.

Pasting schemes for the monoidal biclosed structure on
$\omega\mbox{-} \bf Cat$.

Abstract:
Using the theory of pasting presentations, developed in the previous
paper, I give a detailed description of the tensor product on
$\omega$-categories, which extends Gray's tensor product on
$2$-categories and which is closely related to Brown-Higgins's tensor
product on $\omega$-groupoids.
Immediate consequences are a general and uniform definition of higher
dimensional lax natural transformations, and a nice and transparent
description of the corresponding internal homs. Further consequences
will be in the development of a theory for weak $n$-categories, since
both tensor products and lax structures are crucial in this.

Dear People,

The following update to (and correction of) my thesis, Complexity
Doctrines, is also linked to (either of)

Update to Complexity Doctrines
J. Otto
August 20, 1995

In this note we

1.  point out an (annoying) error (of ours) in background material on
G"odel's system T, and thus pose an question,

2.  improve the definition of tier 0,

3.  improve the definition (and name) of sketches theories,

4.  reduce presheaves to (Makkai) sketches, and

5.  propose a definition of resolutions.

We thus update the June 13, 1995 version of Complexity Doctrines.
That version is currently linked to

  ftp://triples.math.mcgill.ca/pub/otto/otto.html

By the way, Springer LNCS 953 contains a slightly earlier (with an X
which clearly should be a 1) and abridged version of Chapter 2 of
Complexity Doctrines.

1.  System T

We consider NNO (= natural numbers objects) in SMC (=symmetric
monoidal closed) and CC (= cartesian closed) categories.  Write (as
this is not TeX) * for tensor and I for the unit.  Define -o by _ * X
-| X -o _.  Write S for the category of SMC categories having NNO and
of functors preserving chosen structure, and T for the category of CC
categories having NNO and of functors preserving chosen structure.
With J and K initial categories in S and T and with standard structure
on set (the category of small sets), we have the (unique) S and T
functors j : J --> set and k : K --> set.

Statement 5 of Proposition 1.2.4.1 claims (which we now doubt) that j
and k represent the same numeric functions (= functions between finite
powers of N).  The purported proof of Statement 5 fails (as we finally
saw after kind remarks by P. Scott at the 1995 Category Theory and
Computer Science meeting) as while the diagonal diag : N --> N * N is
definable in J [Par'e Rom'an], it is doubtful that e.g. the diagonal
diag : N -o N --> (N -o) * (N -o N) is definable in J.

As both j and k represent the primitive recursive numeric functions,
they both represent Turing machines modulo how long the machines run.
Thus which numeric functions j and k represent is a matter of how fast
such functions can grow.  It is known [Rose, Subrecursion] that the
(set of) numeric functions represented by k is the extended
Grzegorczyk hierarchy below epsilon_0.  At least a naive attempt to
obtain such growth of numeric functions represented by j fails.  In J
we can define, by commuting diagrams,

        0 * N       s * N
  I * N ----> N * N ----> N * N
    |           |           |
    | l_N       | +         | +
    v           v           v
    N --------> N --------> N
         id           s

  e_2 = + diag

      0         s
  I ------> N ------> N
  |         |         |
  | id      | e_n+1   | e_n+1
  v         v         v
  I ------> N ------> N
     s 0       e_n

Now we would like to diagonalize the e_n to get beyond primitive
recursion.  But this may be undefinable in J.  However in K, by using
diag : N -o N --> (N -o N) * (N -o N) and now writing _ x X -| X => _
and 1 rather than _ * X -| X -o _ and I, we can define

               0 x (N => N)         s x (N => N)
  1 x (N => N) ------> N x (N => N) ------> N x (N => N)
       |                    |                    |
       | p_1                | p_1, '             | p_1, '
       v                    v                    v
     N => N ---------> (N => N) x N ------> (N => N) x N
            id, s 0 !               p_0, @

      0           s
  1 ------> N --------> N
  |         |           |
  | id      | f         | f
  v         v           v
  1 ----> N => N ---> N => N
     f_2          "

Here _ x X -| X => _ defines @ : (X => Y) x X --> Y terminal in the
comma category (_ x X)/Y and

  e_2 : N --> N
  ------------------
  f_2 : 1 --> N => N

  ' : N x (N => N) --> N
  -------------------------
  " : (N => N) --> (N => N)

  e : N x N --> N
  ----------------
  f : N --> N => N

Further ! is the unique map to 1.  Then we can diagonalize: e diag.

Thus we pose the question

  Which numeric functions are represented by j?

2.  Tier 0

Tier 0 can be defined as the pseudo-equalizer (aka iso-inserter) of

     T
  C ----> C
    ---->
    I !

(with I ! taking objects to the unit I and maps to the identity on I).

3.  Sketches Theories

Sketches theories, formerly sketch theories, are theories of (Makkai
rather than Ehresmann) sketches.

Definition.  With a a cardinal, an a-sketches theory is a category S
such that

1.  S is small,

2.  S is well-founded, and

3.  S has fan-out < a.

Here that S is well-founded is that for all S objects X all chains of
composable non-identity maps starting from X

  X --> --> ...

have finite length.  Note that well-founded implies acyclic (aka
1-way) and skeletal.  Further, S having fan-out < a is that for all S
objects X the cardinality of the set (indeed, cone) of maps starting
from X is < a.  We are mainly interested in the finitary case, which
is when a is countable.

4.  Reducing Presheaves to (Makkai) Sketches.

[Ad'amek Rosick'y] elegantly present the accessible categories, in
various classes, as the full subcategories in categories of presheaves
set^C of the objects [cone] (orthogonal | injective) relative to small
sets A of (cones | maps).  We reduce, by orthogonality, the categories
of presheaves set^C to categories of a-sketches set^S.

Proposition.  Given a small category C there is a 4-sketches theory S
and a (small) set A of finitely presentable set^S maps such that set^C
is equivalent to the full subcategory in set^S of objects orthogonal
to A.

Proof.  As S objects, take the objects and maps of C.  As non-identity
S maps, indexed by the C maps f : X --> Y, take the (formal) maps c_f
: f --> Y, d_f : f --> X.  Define a functor G : S --> C by c_f |-> f,
d_f |-> id_X.  Then G^* : set^C --> set^S by F |-> F G is faithful
full.  We recover the image of G^*, up to equivalence, by defining A
through the following 3 schemes (using notation as in Complexity
Doctrines).  For C maps f : X --> Y

  {! i_f x : f  d_f i_f x = x : X  [x : X]}

For C identity maps j : X --> X

  {c_j a = d_j a : X  [a : j]}

For C compositions

         h
    ------------>
  X ----> Y ----> Z
     f       g

  {c_h c = c_g b : Z
   [d_h c = d_f a : X  c_f a = d_g b : Y  a : f  b: g  c : h]}

QED

5.  Resolutions

Consider a finitary sketches theory S and a (small) set A of finitely
presentable maps in set^S.  Again (as in [Ad'amek Rosick'y]) reduce
orthogonality to injectivity.  (Thus, for non-epi maps a in A, add to
A the a^* : P --> X induced by the push-out of a along a:

      a                a
    ------>          ------>
  |         |      |         |
  | a       |      | a       | id
  v      po v      v         v
    ------> P        ------> X
                       id

.)  Roughly following [Makkai], define deductions d as compositions of
push-outs (in set^S) of maps a (thought of as axioms) in A.

We propose defining resolutions as cospans (in set^S)

        |
        |
        v
  ---->
   d

with the left map a deduction.  Then resolutions compose as cospans:

                |
                |
           d'   v
          ---->
        |       |
        |       |
        v    po v
  ---->   ---->
   d

As the initial sketch orthogonal to the (original) A is the colimit of
the diagram of deductions from the empty sketch 0, one may wish to
resolve to 0:

          |
          |
          v
  0 ---->
     d

In a resolution

        X
        |
        | f
        v
  ---->
   d

think of X as a query and of f as a partial answer.

Subject: Braided monoidal 2-categories

Date: Fri, 29 Sep 1995 16:27:23 -0700
From: john baez <baez@math.ucr.edu>

Martin Neuchl and I have written a paper entitled "Higher-dimensional
algebra I: braided monoidal 2-categories".  In it, we begin with
a brief sketch of what is known and conjectured concerning braided
monoidal 2-categories and their relevance to 4d topological quantum
field theories and 2-tangles.  Then we give concise definitions of
semistrict monoidal and braided monoidal 2-categories, and show how
these may be unpacked to give definitions similar to, but not quite
the same as, those given by Kapranov and Voevodsky.  Finally, we
describe how to construct a semistrict braided monoidal 2-category
as the "center" of a semistrict monoidal 2-category, in a manner
analogous to the construction of a braided monoidal category as
the center (or "quantum double") of a monoidal category.  As a corollary
this yields a strictification theorem for braided monoidal 2-categories.

This paper is available by anonymous ftp to math.ucr.edu.  It is
the file bm2cat in the directory baez.  It is in uuencoded, compressed
form, because it is 51 pages with lots of pictures.  To print it,
first save the file as "bm2cat" and do "uudecode bm2cat".  This
should produce a file "bm2cat.dvi.Z".  Then do "uncompress bm2cat.dvi.Z".
This should produce a file "bm2cat.dvi," which you can print out
in the way you usually print dvi files.

A semantics for shape
=====================

The basic observation behind shape theory is that most of the functors
F used to model data types share a common characteristic; they have a
cartesian natural transformation into a functor used to store
unstructured data. In the simplest case, the latter is the list (or
free monoid) functor:

        data: F => L

The main result of this paper is that in a locos (an extensive
category with all finite limits and lists) all functors shapely over
lists are closed under the formation of initial algebras. The proof is
constructive - simply build a parser for the initial algebra,
using the existing lists and pullbacks.


Data categories and functors
============================

The functors which are cartesian over lists are good for handling
first order structures, but they are not closed under exponentiation,
and so are inadequate for higher-order types. This defect is remedied
by changing the functor used to store data from lists to a *position
functor* given by an object of positions P. Such a functor maps an
object A to the object

        P --> A+1 .

A *data functor* is a functor F with a given cartesian transformation
to such a position functor. Now, for any object X the functor which
maps A to the object

        X --> FA

is also a position functor, with object of positions XxP.

The key result about data functors is that every natural
transformation between two such is given by a uniform, or parametric
natural transformation. More precisely, if F is a data functor with
object of positions P, and G is a data functor, then every natural
transformation

        F ==> G

is determined by a morphism

        F1 --> GP

This fact makes the data functors suitable for modelling higher types.


Covariant Types
===============

The data categories, in which the theory of data functors is
developed, include the usual semantic categories, such as Sets, and
bottomless c.p.o.'s. However, Reynolds proved that "Polymorphism is
not set-theoretic" by showing that the second-order polymorphic lambda
calculus (system F) has no set-theoretic models. This leads us to ask
what kind of polymorphism is modelled by the data functors. This leads
to the covariant type system in which function types are replaced by
*transformation types*. The system is strong enough to capture the
usual polymorphism of lists and trees, while still having
set-theoretic models. Thus,

        Polymorphism *can* be set-theoretic


Polynomial Polymorphism
=======================

As a sub-system of F, the covariant types do not capture
functoriality.  For shape (or functorial) polymorphism to make sense,
there must be a polymorphic algorithm for evaluating the action of
functors on morphisms, i.e. a polymorphic map. Such an algorithm was
first developed in the type system P2, as described in the following
paper.


Type-free term reduction for covariant types
============================================

A generic algorithm for mapping requires the detection of the data to
which the mapped function must be applied. One method of doing this is
to *tag* the data using a single system of tags appropriate for all
the functors under discussion. A naive approach leads to the tagged
types of this paper.


Functorial types
================

Current work aims to have functors represented directly by types so
that, for example, composition of functors is a primitive operation on
types. This is intended to extend the notion of category theory as a
programming technique.


Shape analysis for parallel computing
=====================================


While shape polymorphism allows us to "ignore" the shape, shape
analysis uses detailed shape information to improve errr detection and
compilation. This is particularly important in parallel programming,
where the shape of the data structures, and their distribution, are
central concerns. This paper presents a survey of the issues, and a
computational paradigm, that will be developed by the

        Algorithms and Languages Group

Subject: announcement

Date: Tue, 7 Nov 1995 20:30:48 -0500
From: Michael Makkai <makkai@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

This is to announce a research monograph,

        First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts,
        with Application to Category Theory

                by M. Makkai (McGill Univ.)

        (Preliminary version)


                            Abstract


J. Cartmell [2] introduced a syntax of variable types, which I call
dependent sorts, for the purposes of presenting generalized
algebraic theories. Cartmell's syntax was "abstracted from ...
Martin-Lof type theory". I add propositional connectives and
quantification to a simplified version of Cartmell's syntax, to
obtain what I call First-Order Logic with Dependent Sorts (FOLDS).
The simplification consists in the exclusion of operation symbols,
and a severe restriction on the use of equality. Quantification is
subject to the natural restriction that a quantifier "for all  x "
or "there is  x " cannot be applied if in the resulting formula
there is a free variable whose sort depends on  x .

An important special case of FOLDS was introduced by G. Blanc [1]
for the purpose of characterizing first-order formulas in the
language of categories that are invariant under equivalence of
categories. P. Freyd's earlier characterization [3], although not
explicitly coached in an instance of FOLDS, is essentially the same
as Blanc's. A. Preller [7] gives an explicit comparison of Blanc's
and Freyd's contexts. The main aim of the present work is to extend
Blanc's and Freyd's characterization from statements about
categories to statements about more complex categorical structures.


A similarity type for structures for FOLDS is given by a one-way
category of sort-forming symbols and relation symbols. One-way
categories were isolated by F. W. Lawvere [4], and were
subsequently shown by him to be relevant for the generalized
sketch-syntax of [5].

The basic metatheory of FOLDS is a simple extension of that of
ordinary multisorted first-order logic. There are simply formulated
complete formal systems for both classical and intuitionistic
FOLDS, with Kripke-style completeness for the intuitionistic case.
The systems use entailments-in-contexts as their basic units;
contexts are systems of typings of variables as usual in Martin-
Lof-style systems. We have Gentzen-style systems admitting cut-
elimination. Natural forms of Craig Interpolation and Beth
Definability are true in both classical and intuitionistic FOLDS.
Much of the basic metatheory is done through the formalism of
appropriate fibrations (hyper-doctrines).

The main new concept is a notion of equivalence of structures for
FOLDS. Equivalent structures satisfy the same sentences of FOLDS.
The main general result is that conversely, first order properties
invariant under equivalence are expressible in FOLDS. A stronger
version of the result takes the form of an interpolation theorem.

Two categories are equivalent in the usual sense iff they are
equivalent as structures for FOLDS. This connection between the
categorical concept of equivalence and FOLDS-equivalence persists
for more complex categorical structures such as (1) a diagram of
categories, functors and natural transformations, or (2) a
bicategory, or (3) a diagram of bicategories, etc., if we pass to
"ana"-versions of the concepts of functor, bicategory, etc.; the
latter were introduced in [6]. Every functor, bicategory, etc., has
its so-called saturation, a simply defined saturated anafunctor,
saturated anabicategory, etc., respectively. A property written in
FOLDS of the saturation is a particular, "good", kind of first-
order property of the original.

Applications of the foregoing give syntactical characterizations of
properties invariant under equivalence in the contexts mentioned.
E.g., a first-order property of a variable bicategory is invariant
under biequivalence iff it is expressible in FOLDS as a property of
the saturated anabicategory canonically associated with the given
bicategory.

\title{On the equivariant 2-type of a $G$-space}

\begin{abstract}

A classical theorem of Mac Lane and Whitehead states that
the homotopy type of a topological space with trivial homotopy at
dimensions 3 and greater can be re\-con\-struct\-ed from its $\pi_1$ and
$\pi_2$, and a cohomology class $k_3\in H^3(\pi_1,\pi_2)$. More recently,
Moerdijk and Svensson suggested the possibility of using Bredon cohomology
to extend this result to the equivariant case, that is, for spaces $X$
equipped with an action by a fixed group $G$. In this paper we carry out
this suggestion and prove an analogue of the classical result in the
equivariant case.

Abstract.  We provide a basis for logic programming into locally
finitely presentable (or l.f.p.) categories.  We thus begin to
consider higher order logic programming.  Horn formulas, in particular
systems of equations, generalize to finite Makkai (or M-) sketches.
Further, models of sets of Horn clauses generalize to, again called
models and forming the l.f.p. categories, M-sketches orthogonal to
sets of maps (axioms) between finite M-sketches.  Resolutions compute
maps (answers) from finite M-sketches (queries) to initial models.
Resolutions are cospans and lift to compositions of special
resolutions.

1. M. Grandis, Categorically algebraic foundations for homotopical algebra,
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 293 (1996).

Abstract. We investigate a structure for an abstract cylinder endofunctor
I  which produces a good basis for homotopical algebra. It essentially
consists of the usual operations (faces, degeneracies, connections,
symmetries, composition) together with a transformation  I^2 -> I^2,
which we call lens collapse after its realisation in the standard
topological case.
This structure, if somewhat heavy, has the interest of being
"categorically algebraic", i.e. based on operations on functors.
Consequently, it can be naturally lifted from a category  A  to its
categories of diagrams  A^S  and its slice categories  A\X,  A/X.  Further,
the dual structure, based on a cocylinder (or path) endofunctor  P  can be
lifted to the category of  A-valued sheaves on a site, whenever  P
preserves limits, and to the category of internal monoids in  A,  with
respect to any monoidal structure of  A  consistent with  P.


2. M. Grandis, On the homotopy structure of strongly homotopy associative
differential algebras,  Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 294 (1996).

Abstract.   We study here the homotopy structure of  Shad,  the
category of strongly homotopy associative d-algebras (shad-algebras for
short), also called A_infinity-algebras and introduced by Stasheff ([St],
1963) for the study of the singular complex of the loop-space of a pointed
topological space.
   Shad  extends the category  Da  of associative differential
(graded) algebras, by allowing for a homotopy relaxation of objects and
morphisms, up to systems of homotopies of arbitrary degree. The
better known category  Dash  of associative differential algebras and
strongly homotopy multiplicative maps (Stasheff-Halperin [StH], Munkholm
[Mu1-4]), having strict objects (the ones of  Da)  and lax morphisms (the
ones of  Shad)  is intermediate between them. A crucial advantage of  Shad
over its subcategories  Dash  and  Da  is the homotopy invariance property
proved by Gugenheim - Stasheff [GuS].
   In order to study shad-homotopies of any order and their
operations, the usual cocylinder functor of d-algebras is here extended to
Shad,  where we construct the vertical composition and reversion of
homotopies (also existing in  Dash,  but not in  Da)  and homotopy
pullbacks (which exist in  Da,  but not in  Dash).
   Shad  acquires thus a laxified version of the homotopy structure
studied by the author in previous works; the main results therein,
developing homotopical algebra from the Puppe sequence to stabilisation and
triangulated structures, can very likely be extended to the new axioms, so
to be available for  Shad.

         for Categories of Domains and Continuous Functions

                            Synopsis

Domain-theoretic categories are axiomatised by means of categorical
non-order-theoretic requirements on a cartesian closed category
equipped with a commutative monad.  We prove an enrichment theorem
showing that every axiomatic domain-theoretic category can be endowed
with an intensional notion of approximation, the path relation, with
respect to which the category Cpo-enriches. Subsequently, we provide a
representation theorem of the form: every small domain-theoretic
category (with a lifting monad) has a full and faithful representation
in a domain-theoretic category of cpos and continuous functions (with a
lifting monad) in a suitable intuitionistic set theory.

Our analysis suggests more liberal notions of domains.  In particular,
we present a category where the path order is not omega-complete, but
in which the constructions of domain theory (as, for example, the
existence of uniform fixed-point operators and the solution of domain
equations) are possible.

          Categories for computation in context and unified logic: I

             by R.F. Blute, J.R.B. Cockett, and R.A.G. Seely

Abstract
In this paper we introduce the notion of contextual categories.  These
provide a categorical semantics for the modelling of computation in context,
based on the idea of separating logical sequents into two zones, one
representing the context over which the computation is occurring, the other
the computation itself. The separation into zones is achieved via a
bifunctor equipped with a tensorial strength. We show that a category with
such a functor can be viewed as having an action on itself. With this
interpretation, we obtain a fibration in which the base category consists of
contexts, and the reindexing functors are used to change the context.

We further observe that this structure also provides a framework for
developing categorical semantics for Girard's Unified Logic, a key feature
of which is to separate logical sequents into two zones, one in which
formulas behave classically and one in which they behave linearly.  This
separation is analogous to the context/computation separation above, and is
handled by our semantics in a similar fashion.  Furthermore, our approach
allows an analysis of the exponen
ntial structure of linear logic using a
tensorially strong action as the primitive notion. We demonstrate that from
such a structure one can recover a model of the linear storage operator.

Finally, we introduce a sequent calculus for the fragment of Unified Logic
modeled by contextual categories. We show cut elimination for this fragment,
and we introduce a simple notion of proof circuit, which provides a
description of free contextual categories.

        Linear Logic complements Classical Logic
        V.R. Pratt
        To appear in preliminary proceedings of Linear Logic '96, Tokyo

Classical logic enforces the separation of individuals and predicates,
linear logic draws them together via interaction; these are not
right-or-wrong alternatives but dual or complementary logics.  Linear
logic is an incomplete realization of this duality.  While its
completion is not essential for the development and maintenance of
logic, it is crucial for its application.  We outline the
``four-square'' program for completing the connection, whose corners
are set, function, number, and arithmetic, and define ordinal Set, a
bicomplete *equational* topos, meaning its canonical isomorphisms are
identities, including associativity of product.

        CATEGORICAL LOGIC OF NAMES AND ABSTRACTION
        IN ACTION CALCULI

Abstract.

Milner's action calculus implements abstraction in monoidal
categories, so that familiar lambda-calculi can be subsumed together
with the pi-calculus and the Petri nets. Variables are generalised to
*names*: only a restricted form of substitution is allowed.

In the present paper, the well-known categorical semantics of the
lambda-calculus is generalised to the action calculus. A suitable
functional completeness theorem for symmetric monoidal categories is
proved: we determine the conditions under which the abstraction is
definable. Algebraically, the distinction between the variables and
the names boils down to the distinction between the transcendental and
the algebraic elements. The former lead to polynomial extensions, like
e.g. the ring Z[x], the latter to algebraic extensions like
Z[\sqrt{2}] or Z[i].

Building upon the work of P.~Gardner, we introduce *action
categories*, and show that they are related to the static action
calculus exacly as cartesian closed categories are related to the
lambda-calculus. Natural examples of this structure arise from
allegories and cartesian bicategories. On the other hand, the free
algebras for any commutative Moggi monad form an action category. The
general correspondence of action calculi and Moggi monads will be
worked out in a sequel to this work.

BOOK ANNOUNCEMENT
-----------------


Foundations for Programming Languages

     by  John C. Mitchell 


         "Programming languages embody the pragmatics of designing
         software systems, and also the mathematical concepts which underlie
         them. Anyone who wants to know how, for example, object-oriented
         programming rests upon a firm foundation in logic should read this
         book. It guides one surefootedly through the rich variety of basic
         programming concepts developed over the past forty years."
         -- Robin Milner, Professor of Computer Science, The Computer
         Laboratory, Cambridge University 

         "Programming languages need not be designed in an intellectual
         vacuum; John Mitchell's book provides an extensive analysis of the
         fundamental notions underlying programming constructs. A basic
         grasp of this material is essential for the understanding, comparative
         analysis, and design of programming languages."
         -- Luca Cardelli, Digital Equipment Corporation 


Written for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, Foundations for
Programming Languages uses a series of typed lambda calculi to study the axiomatic,
operational, and denotational semantics of sequential programming languages. Later
chapters are devoted to progressively more sophisticated type systems. 

Compared to other texts on the subject, Foundations for Programming Languages is
distinguished primarily by its inclusion of material on universal algebra and algebraic
data types, imperative languages and Floyd-Hoare logic, and advanced chapters on
polymorphism and modules, subtyping and object-oriented concepts, and type
inference. The book is mathematically oriented but includes discussion, motivation,
and examples that make the material accessible to students specializing in software
systems, theoretical computer science, or mathematical logic.

Foundations for Programming Languages is suitable as a reference for professionals
concerned with programming languages, software validation or verification, and
programming, including those working with software modules or object-oriented
programming.

Here is the abstract of a paper I wrote:

Higher-Dimensional Algebra II: 2-Hilbert Spaces

A 2-Hilbert space is a category with structures and properties
analogous to those of a Hilbert space.  More precisely, we define a
2-Hilbert space to be an abelian category enriched over Hilb with a
*-structure, conjugate-linear on the hom-sets, satisfying
<fg,h> = <g,f*h> = <f,hg*>.  We also define monoidal, braided monoidal,
and symmetric monoidal versions of 2-Hilbert spaces, which we call
2-H*-algebras, braided 2-H*-algebras, and symmetric 2-H*-algebras, and
we describe the relation between these and tangles in 2, 3, and 4
dimensions, respectively.  We prove a generalized Doplicher-Roberts
theorem stating that every symmetric 2-H*-algebra is equivalent to the
category Rep(G) of continuous unitary finite-dimensional representations
of some compact supergroupoid G.  The equivalence is given by a
categorified version of the Gelfand transform; we also construct a
categorified version of the Fourier transform when G is a compact
abelian group.  Finally, we characterize Rep(G) by its universal
properties when G is a compact classical group.  For example, Rep(U(n))
is the free connected symmetric 2-H*-algebra on one even object of
dimension n.

This paper is long and contains pictures and diagrams, so I have
made a compressed Postscript file of it available at

It is also available by anonymous ftp to math.ucr.edu, where it is the

one can download it and then uncompress it by typing

      CATEGORIES FOR COMPUTATION IN CONTEXT AND UNIFIED LOGIC

         by R.F. Blute, J.R.B. Cockett, and R.A.G. Seely


ABSTRACT
In this paper we introduce context categories to provide a framework for
computations in context.  The structure also provides a basis for
developing the categorical proof theory of Girard's unified logic. A key
feature of this logic is the separation of sequents into classical and
linear zones.  These zones may be modelled categorically as a
context/computation separation given by a fibration. The perspective
leads to an analysis of the exponential structure of linear logic using
strength (or context) as the primitive notion.

Context is represented by the classical zone on the left of the turnstile
in unified logic.  To model the classical zone to the right of the
turnstile, it is necessary to introduce a notion of cocontext.  This
results in a fibrational fork over context and cocontext and leads to
the notion of a bicontext category.  When we add the structure of a
weakly distributive category in a suitably fork fibred manner, we obtain
a model for a core fragment of unified logic.

We describe the sequent calculus for the fragment of unified logic
modelled by context categories; cut elimination holds for this fragment.
Categorical cut elimination also is valid, but a proof of this fact is
deferred to a sequel.

REMARKS
This is a completely revised version of the paper we announced in
February this year.  At the suggestion of an anonymous referee, we have
dropped all reference to the circuits of the system we originally
described, and extended the system to include multiple-conclusions as
well as multiple-hypotheses in the sequent calculus, in both the
"classical" and "linear" positions.  This is the heart of the system LU
of Girard, and a recipe is given to allow further extensions.  We plan
to describe the circuits (proof nets) for the expanded system in a
sequel, which will allow shorter and clearer proofs of categorical cut
elimination, as well as comparisons with other systems (such as our own
weakly distributive categories with storage and Bierman's MELL).

Since the original paper contains some material not carried over to the
revision - most significantly, the sequent calculus for the single-
conclusion logic (the "intuitionist" case), plus the proof circuits for
that logic - it remains on the ftp site with a different name and link.

Minimal Realization in Bicategories of Automata
R. Rosebrugh, N. Sabadini and R. F. C. Walters

The context of this article is the program to develop monoidal
bicategories with a feedback operation as an algebra of processes, with
applications to concurrency theory.  The objective here is to study
reachability, minimization and minimal realization in these bicategories.
In this setting the automata are 1-cells in contrast with previous studies
where they appeared as objects. As a consequence we are able to study the
relation of minimization and minimal realization to serial composition of
automata using (co)lax (co)monads.  We are led to define suitable
behaviour categories and prove minimal realization theorems which extend
classical results.

%%  Abstract for: A convenient category for games and interaction

  We present a simple construction of an order-enriched category
  gam  that simultaneously dualizes and parallels the familiar
  construction of the category  rel  of relations.  Objects of
  gam  are sets, and arrows are games, viewed as special kinds of
  trees.  The quest for identities for the composition of trees
  naturally leads to the consideration of alternating sequences and
  games of a specific polarity.  gam  may be viewed as a canonical
  extension of  rel , and just as for  rel , the maps in  gam
  admit a nice charactrization.  Disjoint union of sets induces a
  special tensor product on  gam  that allows us to recover the
  monoidal closed category of games and strategies of interest in game
  theory.  If we allow games with explicit delay moves, the
  categorical description of the structure that leads to the monoidal
  closed category is even more satisfying.  In particular, we then
  obtain an explicit involution.


%%  Abstract for: Monads and interpolads in bicategories

  Monads may be viewed as lax functors from the terminal category into
  a bicategory.  If the target has local stable coequalizers, monads
  together with lax functors from the two-element chain, here called
  m-modules, can be organized into another bicategory, through which
  every lax functor into the original one factors.  M-modules are
  special cases of modules between endo-1-cells, which behave well
  with respect to composition, but in general fail to have identities.
  To overcome this problem, we do not need to impose the full
  structure of a monad on the endo-1-cells, an associative
  coequalizing operation suffices.  The bicategory of these so-called
  interpolads together with structure-preserving modules is
  Cauchy-complete, and contains the bicategory of monads as a usually
  non-full sub-bicategory.  If we start from a bicategory that has all
  right liftings, modules in general, and the bicategories of
  interpolads and of monads in particular, inherit this property,
  provided the hom-categories of the base have equalizers.  While
  interpolads over  rel  are just idempotent relations, over the
  suspension of  set  they correspond to interpolative semi-groups,
  and over  spn  they lead to a notion of ``category without
  identities'', also known as a taxonomy.

Subject: Correction to paper - distributive is not weakly distributive

Date: Tue, 3 Sep 1996 16:13:35 -0400
From: Robert A. G. Seely <rags@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

The following notice and discussion amplifies some recent remarks made
by Robin Cockett on the CATEGORIES list.


We wish to announce a correction to a statement in the paper

                   Weakly distributive categories

                   by J.R.B. Cockett and R.A.G. Seely


An error in Proposition 3.1, where we claimed that distributive
categories are weakly distributive, was found in proof.  The result is
totally incorrect: a distributive category is a cartesian weakly
distributive category if and only if it a preorder.  (Note: a weakly
distributive category may be cartesian - by which we just mean the
tensor and cotensor ("par") are cartesian product and coproduct
respectively - without being a preorder; it is the distributivity that
causes the collapse.)

In particular, any distributive category which satisfies equation (13):

                           \delta^R_R
             (A+B)x(C+D)  ------------>  A+(Bx(C+D))
                  |                           |
       \delta^L_L |                           |
                  v                           |
             ((A+B)xC)+D                      | 1 + \delta^L_L
                  |                           |
   \delta^R_R + 1 |                           |
                  v              a            v
             (A+(BxC))+D  ------------>  A+((BxC)+D)

   (where we write x for the tensor, + for the cotensor (par),
    and 1 for identity)

for the choice of weak distributions described in the paper is
immediately a preorder.  This because in that diagram if A=D=1 and B=C=0
then, up to equivalence, we obtain for the two sides of diagram the
coproduct embeddings of 1 into 1+1.  This suffices to cause collapse.
The argument can be modified to show that in any distributive category
which is simultaneously weakly distributive (no matter how the weak
distributions are defined), Boolean negation must have a fixed point.
This also suffices to cause collapse.

A consequence of this observation is that the categorical proof theory
of not-necessarily-intuitionist AND/OR logic is somewhat subtle.  In the
absence of any connective for implication, there is no apparent a priori
reason not to have multiple-conclusion sequents; let's see what this
yields.  We start with the premise that a good semantics for AND/OR
logic ought to be a polycategory; in particular, that the morphisms
interpreting the following two derivations must be equal.  (That these
are equal is a consequence of the polycategory definition, but you can
judge them on their own merits if you like.  This type of permutation of
cuts is pretty standard, and categorical cut elimination then would
demand that they be equal.)

(Notation: I use -> for the sequent turnstile, and x and + for AND and
OR.  The interpretation of the commas is, as is usual in such logics,
AND on the left and OR on the right, so there are evident identity maps
representing A,B -> AxB and A+B -> A,B.  All deduction steps are cuts.
The cut rule is  XX,A -> YY  and  WW -> A,UU  entail  XX,WW -> YY,UU
and variants via exchange.)


  B,C -> BxC   A+B -> A,B
 -------------------------
      A+B,C -> A,BxC      C+D -> C,D
     --------------------------------
            A+B,C+D -> A,BxC,D



                       B,C -> BxC   C+D -> C,D
                      -------------------------
         =                 B,C+D -> BxC,D      A+B -> A,B
                          --------------------------------
                                 A+B,C+D -> A,BxC,D


But here's the catch - with the obvious interpretation, these come out
different in SETS: think of the image of a pair <a,d> in (A+B)x(C+D),
where a \in A and d \in D.  For the top map, this is mapped to a,
whereas for the bottom map it is mapped to d.  This is just our equation
(13) again, so the point of our initial comment is that in any
distributive category, with any interpretation, these two maps are equal
iff the category is a preorder.

This is a pretty "stripped down" example - it seems that categorical cut
elimination is inconsistent with using distributive categories for
AND/OR logic and general sequents. This problem is averted of course if
one restricts oneself to "intuitionist" sequents (with the right of the
turnstile restricted to single formulas), but then this result may be
seen as indicating how the folkloric result concerning the collapse of
categorical proof theory for classical logic (Joyal) doesn't really
depend on very much structure - note that we have assumed no structure
rules beyond cut, and the linear versions of the AND/OR sequent rules;
the collapse just needs multiple-conclusion sequents and distributivity.

It is interesting to note, however, that by carefully choosing the weak
distributions one can construct a cartesian weakly distributive category
from an elementary distributive category by simply passing to the
Kleisli category of the ``exception monad'' E(X) = X+1. So, for example,
although SETS is not weakly distributive itself, POINTED_SETS is.

The error means, of course, that all discussion in the paper of
non-posetal distributive categories as examples of weakly distributive
categories must be discounted.  This mainly affects the Introduction and
Section 3, where Proposition 3.1 must be restated as indicated above,
and the surrounding text must take this restatement into account.  In
particular, Theorem 3.3, although still correct, ought to be stengthened
to state that a cartesian weakly distributive category is a preorder if
and only if it has a strict initial object.

A version of this paper which contains a rewritten Introduction and
Section 3 may be found on rags' WWW home page at this URL:
     <http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~rags>.
These comments will also appear in the published version of the paper
(to appear in JPAA).

Finally, the inevitable controversy about terminology: we have decided
to continue calling these categories "weakly distributive", since we
have done so for so long and in so many places.  Besides, Hyland and
dePaiva had arrived at the same name for the "weak distributivities",
independently, and at the same time.  But we keep an open mind about
these matters: if another name seems to have near-universal approval, we
will adopt it too.  The most promising seems to be Barr's suggestion of
"linearly distributive".  Indeed, had that suggestion been made in 1991,
we might have adopted it then (it certainly beats "dissociative
categories"!)

        email: rblute@mathstat.uottawa.ca, phil@csi.uottawa.ca


                               ABSTRACT

We present a full completeness theorem for the multiplicative
fragment of a variant of noncommutative linear logic known
as cyclic linear logic (CyLL), first defined by Yetter.
The semantics is obtained by considering dinatural transformations
on a category of topological vector spaces which are equivariant
under certain actions of a noncocommutative Hopf algebra, called the
shuffle algebra. Multiplicative sequents are assigned a vector
space of such dinaturals, and we show that the space has the denotations
of cut-free proofs in CyLL+MIX as a basis. This can be viewed as a fully
faithful representation of a free *-autonomous category,
canonically enriched over vector spaces.

This work is a natural extension
of the authors' previous work, ``Linear Lauchli Semantics'', where a
similar theorem is obtained for the commutative logic. In that paper, we
consider dinaturals which are invariant under certain actions of the
additive group of integers. We also present here a simplification of that
work by showing that the invariance criterion is actually a consequence
of dinaturality. The passage from groups to Hopf algebras corresponds
to the passage from commutative to noncommutative logic.

ABSTRACT
This note is a survey of techniques we have used in studying coherence
for monoidal categories with two tensors, corresponding to the tensor -
par fragment of linear logic.  We apply these ideas to several
situations which extend our previous work, in particular, the Full
Intuitionistic Linear Logic (FILL) of Hyland and de Paiva, and the
Bilinear Logic of Lambek. Note that the latter is a noncommutative
logic; we also consider the noncommutative version of FILL.  We show
that the essential difference between FILL and multiplicative linear
logic lies in making a tensorial strength natural transformation an
isomorphism. We briefly discuss the structure of the nucleus of a
category modelling FILL: the nucleus is a *-autonomous full subcategory.
In addition, we define and study the appropriate categorical structure
corresponding to the mix rule. For all these structures, we do not
restrict consideration to ``pure'' logic, in that we allow for the
inclusion of non-logical axioms. We define the appropriate notion of
proof nets for these logics, and use them to describe coherence results
for the corresponding categorical structures.


We would draw your attention to the following "highlights":
 - we develop proof nets for FILL (as well as bilinear logic - but this
latter is shown equivalent to the system of non-commutative *-autonomous
categories we studied in an earlier paper [BCST],
<ftp://triples.math.mcgill.ca/pub/rags/nets/nets.ps.gz>
so that is not new).
 - we show several equivalent formulations of bilinear logic =
non-commutative $*$-autonomous categories.  One interesting one is that
if one requires of a FILL category that a natural transformation
equivalent to the tensorial strength given by the weak distributivity is
isomorphic, then you get the full bilinear logic.
 - we introduce a generalisation of the notion of "nuclear map" suitable
for weakly distributive categories, and show the nucleus of a FILL
category is *-autonomous.
 - we give a rigorous definition of what it means for a category to
satisfy the MIX rule (previous attempts dealt only with the existence of
the required maps, and not the necessary coherence also needed), and
prove a coherence theorem for this doctrine.
 - these last two points are linked by the observation that a weakly
distributive category satisfies MIX iff its nucleus does.  As a
consequence we note that "cartesian" weakly distributive categories
(where the tensor is cartesian product) must satisfy MIX.

                and of locally polypresentable categories
                                Michel Hebert

Abstract:  We give syntactic characterizations of (1): the (finitary)
 theories whose categories of models are closed under the formation
 of pullbacks, and of (2) (its categorical counterpart): the locally
 omega-polypresentable categories. A somewhat typical example is the
 category of algebraically closed fields. Case (1) is proved by
 classical model-theoretic methods; it solves a problem raised by H.
 Volger (with motivations from the theory of abstract data types).
 The solution of case (2) is in the spirit of the ones for the locally
omega-presentable and omega-multipresentable cases found by M.
 Coste and P.T. Johnstone respectively. The problem (2) was raised in
the context of Domain Theory by F. Lamarche.
        This implies in particular the (maybe already known) fact that a
 (finitary) theory invariant under pullbacks has its category of
 models omega-accessible. We give an example showing that this is
 false for equalizers.

                Normalization and the Yoneda Embedding

                                by

                Djordje Cubric, Peter Dybjer, and Philip Scott



    We show how to solve the word problem for simply typed
\lambda\beta\eta-calculus by using a few well-known facts about
categories of presheaves and the Yoneda embedding. The formal setting
for these results is $\cP$-category theory, a version of ordinary
category theory where each hom-set is equipped with a partial
equivalence relation. The part of $\cP$-category theory we develop
here is constructive and thus permits extraction of programs. It is
this intuitionistic aspect of our work which is fundamental to
obtaining a normalization algorithm.

    In a certain sense, our program is dual to J. Lambek's original goal
of categorical proof theory, in which he used cut-elimination to study
categorical coherence problems. Here,  we use a method inspired from
categorical coherence proofs to normalize lambda terms (and thus

make no use of traditional proof-theoretic or  rewriting techniques.

"Quotient maps of locales"

This paper considers the question of how to characterize regular epis in the
category Loc of locales.

The most interesting results are that regular epis don't compose in Loc, and
that not all closed surjections are regular epis, although those with subfit
domain (= all open sublocales are joins of closed sublocales) are.

The paper also contains a characterization of regular epis in Loc and several
examples which indicate that it is unlikely that there is a characterization
similar to the characterization of regular epis in the category of topological
spaces as quotient maps.

Two Models of Synthetic Domain Theory (by Fiore and Rosolini)

Two models of synthetic domain theory encompassing traditional categories of
domains are introduced.  First, we present a Grothendieck topos embedding the
category \omega-Cpo of \omega-complete posets and \omega-continuous functions
as a reflective exponential ideal.  Second, we obtain analogous results with
respect to a category of domains and stable functions.

An Extension of Models of Axiomatic Domain Theory to Models of Synthetic
Domain Theory (by Fiore and Plotkin)

We relate certain models of Axiomatic Domain Theory (ADT) and Synthetic Domain
Theory (SDT).  On the one hand, we introduce a class of non-elementary models
of SDT and show that the domains in them yield models of ADT.  On the other
hand, for each model of ADT in a wide class we construct a model of SDT such
that the domains in it provide a model of ADT which conservatively extends the
original model.

categories, Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 329 (1996).

Regards,
Marco Grandis


Abstract. Variables in a category  X  are introduced, extending subobjects.
Variables are well related to weak limits, as subobjects to limits; and
they may be viewed as a replacement of subobjects in categories just
possessing weak limits, typically homotopy categories.

        From a formal point of view, the Freyd embedding  X --> FrX
(introduced to embed the stable homotopy category of spaces into an abelian
category, in Freyd, "Stable homotopy", La Jolla) allows one to reduce
variables in  X  to distinguished subobjects in  FrX  (with respect to a
canonical factorisation structure) and, loosely speaking, weak limits to
limits. Thus, "homotopy variables" for a space  X,  with respect to the
homotopy category  HoTop,  form a lattice  Fib(X)  of types of fibrations
over  X,  which can be identified to the lattice of distinguished
subobjects of  X  in  Fr(HoTop).

        Concretely, we give here various instances of the classification of
variables within finitely generated abelian groups, as a first step towards
a general classification of such variables, and of homotopy variables for
spaces having the homotopy type of a CW-complex.

[From the Introduction:

A (categorical) *variable* of an object  A  is an equivalence-class of
morphisms with values in  A,  where  x: X -- > A  corresponds to
y: Y -- > A  iff there exist maps  u, v  such that  x = yu,  y = xv.
Among them, the *monic* variables (having some representative which
is so) can be identified to subobjects. As a motivation for the name, a
morphism  x: X --> A  is commonly viewed within category theory as a
"variable element" of  A,  parametrised over  X.]

On generation and implicit partial operations in
locally presentable categories

Michel Hebert (The American University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt)

Abstract. In a locally a-presentable category C, seen as a category of a-ary
S-sorted structures, we describe the subobjects (resp. the regular, strong
 subobjects) generated by a subset, first in terms of closure under specific
types of implicit partial operations (IPO), and then in syntactic terms,
using variations on the concept of dominion. This extends previous results
from [Hebert, Can. J.Math 93]. The domain of definition of an IPO of arity
 s ->s  is a subfunctor V >--> U(s)  of the appropriate forgetful functor,
 and each limit-closed domain  V determines, in a natural way, a structure P(V)
 in C having as its elements of sort s the (s->s)-ary IPO's with domain V
(This generalizes the fact that the elements of sort s of the free structure F(s)
can be seen as the (s->s)-ary implicit total operations in C). The P(V)'s
for subobject-closed V >--> Us with   | s | < a are precisely the
a-generated objects (in the sense of Gabriel-Ulmer) of C. Finally we use
IPO's to give a characterization of the so-called a-retractions,
which parallels the known syntactic characterization of a-pure morphisms.
        The point of view adopted in this paper is the one of the algebraist or
model-theorist wishing to use the tools of category theory without making
 radical changes in the concrete description of his/her favourite structures
(in particular without modifying the type). A part of the paper deals with
the translation problems which arise.

%%  Abstract for: A convenient category for games and interaction

  Guided by the familiar construction of the category  rel  of
  relations, we first construct an order-enriched category  gam .
  Objects are sets, and 1-cells are games, viewed as special kinds of
  trees.  The quest for identities for the composition of arbitrary
  trees naturally suggests alternating trees of a specific
  orientation.  Disjoint union of sets induces a tensor product
  $\otimes$ and an operation  --o  on  gam  that allow us to
  recover the monoidal closed category of games and strategies of
  interest in game theory.  Since  gam  does not have enough maps,
  \ie, left adjoint 1-cells, these operations do not have nice
  intrinsic descriptions in  gam .  This leads us to consider games
  with explicit delay moves.  To obtain the ``projection'' maps
  lacking in  gam , we consider the Kleisli-category  K  induced by
  the functor  _+1  on the category of maps in  gam .  Then we
  extend  gam  as to have  K  as category of maps.  Now a
  satisfactory intrinsic description of the tensor product exists,
  which also allows us to express  --o  in terms of simpler
  operations.  This construction makes clear why $\multimap$, the key
  to the notion of strategy, cannot be functorial on  gam .
  Nevertheless, the composition of games may be viewed as orthogonal to
  the familiar composition of strategies in a common framework.

Subject: Locales as "topology-free spaces"

Date: Fri, 21 Feb 1997 11:34:36 +0000
From: Steve Vickers <sjv@doc.ic.ac.uk>

I am making two papers available as Departmental Research Reports:

   "Topical Categories of Domains"
   "Localic Completion of Quasimetric Spaces"

Both explore the idea of locales (and, indeed, toposes) as "topology-free
spaces". The technique is to work not with frames (point-free topologies)
but with presentations of them, understood as propositional geometric
theories whose models are the points. (But it is normally more convenient
to work with equivalent predicate theories.) Then -

*   the geometric theory already determines an implicit topology on its models;

*   any construction of models of one theory out of models of another
automatically determines a continuous map (or geometric morphism), just so
long as the construction is geometric.

In effect, a restriction to geometric mathematics removes the need to treat
topology explicitly, hence "topology-free spaces". Apparently, explicit
topology is needed to correct the over-credulousness of classical reasoning
principles, though in practice the geometric constraints often end up
forcing one to reintroduce the normal topological arguments in a different
guise.

The two papers test the applicability of the idea in the two areas of
domain theory and quasimetric spaces. Aside from the "topology-free space"
aspects, the papers develop some new results:

"Topical Categories of Domains" addresses categorical domain theory and
replaces the usual classes of objects and morphisms by toposes classifying
them. New general results concerning fixpoints of endo-geometric-morphisms
of toposes exploit their intrinsically topological nature to give a simple
approach to the solution of domain equations. The paper also gives a
summary of the constructive theory of Kuratowski finite sets and
establishes some limitations to the Cartesian closedness of Sets.

"Localic Completion of Quasimetric Spaces" proposes a construction of
locales in completion of quasimetric spaces (using ideas of flatness
deriving from Lawvere's enriched category account), studies the
powerlocales and shows that a limit map from a locale of Cauchy sequences
to the completion is triquotient in the sense of Plewe.

Paper copies are available from me; electronic copies are expected to be
available shortly in the Department of Computing's Research Report series
coordinated by Frank Kriwaczek (frk@doc.ic.ac.uk).

                                 Synopsis
 
We study the enrichment of models of axiomatic domain theory.  To this end, we
introduce a new and broader notion of domain, viz. that of complete cuboidal
set, that complies with the axiomatic requirements.  We show that the category
of complete cuboidal sets provides a general notion of enrichment for a wide 
class of axiomatic domain-theoretic structures. 
 
 Cuboidal sets play a role similar to that played by posets in the traditional
 setting.  They are the analogue of simplicial sets but with the simplicial 
 category enlarged to the cuboidal category of cuboids, i.e. of finite 
 products  O_n1 x ... x O_ni  of finite ordinals.  These cuboids are the 
 possible shapes of paths.  A cuboidal set  P  has a set  P(C)  of paths of 
 every shape  C = n1 x ... x ni;  indeed, it is a (rooted) presheaf over the 
 cuboidal category.  The set of points of  P  is  P(O_1).  The set of 
 (one-dimensional) paths of length  n  is  P(O_n+1);  they can be thought of 
 as (linear) computations conditional on the occurrence of  n  linearly 
 ordered events  e_1 < ... < e_n.  Evidently,  O_n  is the partial order 
 associated to this simple linear event structure, and can be considered as a 
 sequential process of length  n.  At higher dimensions,  P(O_n1 x ... x O_ni)
 can be thought of as the set of computations conditional on the occurrence of 
 n_1 + ... + n_i  events ordered by  e_1,1 < ... < e_1,n1 ; ... ; 
 e_i,1 < ... < e_i,ni.  This is the event structure which can be considered 
 as  i  sequential processes, of respective lengths  O_n1, ..., O_ni,  running 
 concurrently.
 
 Complete cuboidal sets are cuboidal sets equipped with a formal-lub operator 
 satisfying three algebraic laws, which are exactly those needed of the lub 
 operator in order to prove the fixed-point theorem.  Computationally, the 
 passage from cuboidal sets to complete cuboidal sets corresponds to allowing 
 infinite processes.  In fact, the formal-lub operator assigns paths of shape 
 C  to `paths of shape  C x omega',  for every  C.  Here the set of paths of 
 shape  C x omega  is the colimit of the paths of shape  C x O_n;  such paths 
 can be thought of as the higher-dimensional analogue of the increasing 
 sequences of traditional domain theory.

Title: The role of Michael Batanin's monoidal globular categories
            Lecture I:  Globular categories and trees
            Lecture II: Higher operads and weak omega-categories
 
        This is a report on recent work of Michael Batanin. The goal of his
work is to provide an environment for defining the concepts associated with
weak omega-categories and for developing the ensuing theory.  The approach
is "globular".
 
        To put this in context, I might mention some important steps in the
development of weak omega-categories. Categories were defined by
Eilenberg-Mac Lane in 1945. Monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories were
defined by Mac Lane in 1963.  Ehresmann defined (strict) n-categories in
1966.  Bnabou defined bicategories in 1967.  In the early 80s, monoidal
bicategories were in the air but a full definition was not published in
that period. Joyal-Street defined braided monoidal categories in 1985.
Gordon-Power-Street defined tricategories in 1991 (this, and the coherence
theorem, were published in 1995). Braided monoidal categories were defined
by Kapranov-Voevodsky-Baez-Neuchl-Breen around 1993.  Trimble produced a
definition of tetracategory in 1995.
        Diverse approaches to weak n-categories for all n have appeared.
Street (1985) suggested a simplicial definition with horn filler
conditions.  Trimble (1994) approached the problem using operads and
Stasheff associahedra.  Baez-Dolan (1995) have a definition using typed
operads and opetopes.  Tamsamani (1996) gave a multisimplicial definition.
Batanin uses higher operads and globular sets.

                                Abstract.

The paper is devoted to the problem of defining weak
$\omega$-categories.
The definition presented here  is based on a nontrivial 
generalization of the apparatus of operads and their algebras, 
originally developed by P.May \cite{May} for the needs of algebraic
topology. 

Yet, for the purposes of higher order category theory, a higher 
dimensional notion of operad is required. 
Briefly, the idea of a higher operad may be explained as follows.

An ordinary non-symmetric operad in $Set$  associates  a set $A_{n}$ 
to every integer $n$. The set of integers may be interpreted 
as the set of $1$-cells in the free category generated by one object 
and one nonidentity endomorphism of this object. To find  a higher order
generalization of the notion of operad we have to describe the free 
strict $\omega$-category  generated by   one object 
and one nonidentity endomorphism of this object and one nonidentity 
endomorphism of this endomorphism and so on (so, for example, the set 
of integers is the one-dimensional part of this category). The required
$\omega$-category $Tr$ will be the category of planar trees of a special
type. The $k$-th composition of cells will be given by the colimit of
the diagram of trees over a special tree $M_{n}^{k}$. 

The other component of the theory of operads is an appropriate 
monoidal category (with some extrastructure like braiding 
or symmetry) where one can consider the notion of operad.  We 
need also  a monoidal category (perhaps, with extrastructure as 
well) where one can define the notion of algebra for an operad. Finally,
the corresponding coherence theorems for both types of monoidal
categories are required.
    I call all these components a natural environment 
for a given theory of operads. One of my main goals was to find a 
natural environment for the theory of higher order operads.

 For this I introduce  monoidal globular categories and show 
they are suitable for  the development of the theory of higher order
operads. The crucial point here is a coherence theorem for monoidal
globular categories (section 4) which includes as  special cases the
coherence theorems for monoidal, symmetric monoidal, and braided
monoidal categories and a sort of pasting theorem for
$\omega$-categories.

A primary example of a globular monoidal category is the globular 
category of $n$-spans $Span$. The $0$-spans are just the sets. The 
$1$-spans are the spans in $Set$ in the usual sense. In some informal
sense, an $n$-span is a relation between two $(n-1)$-spans. This
globular monoidal category plays the same role for   higher-order
category theory as the category of sets does for ordinary category
theory. 

These results  allow me to formulate the notion of higher order 
operad.
       An $\omega$-operad  will associate an $n$-span to 
       every $n$-cell in $Tr$ for every $n\ge 0$.} There are
       also the units and multiplications  and some axioms for
       these operations.  
The category of non-symmetric operads (in the 
category of sets) is just a one-dimensional subcategory of the category
of $\omega$-operads. 

Finally, Iintroduce a notion of a  contractible  
$\omega$-operad, So the main definition is:

        A weak $\omega$-category is a globular set together 
        with the structure of  algebra over a universal
contractible          $\omega$-operad.

I construct also a  fundamental $n$-groupoid functor from topological
spaces to the category of weak $n$categories for all $n$ including
$\omega$ and consider another examples of weak $n$-categories, hifger
operads and their algebras.

An Introduction to n-Categories
John C. Baez
 
An n-category is some sort of algebraic structure consisting of objects,
morphisms between objects, 2-morphisms between morphisms, and so on up
to n-morphisms, together with various ways of composing them.  We survey
various concepts of n-category, with an emphasis on `weak' n-categories,
in which all rules governing the composition of j-morphisms hold only up
to equivalence.  (An n-morphism is an equivalence if it is invertible,
while a j-morphism for j < n is an equivalence if it is invertible up to
a (j+1)-morphism that is an equivalence.)  We discuss applications of
weak n-categories to various subjects including homotopy theory and
topological quantum field theory, and review the definition of weak
n-category recently proposed by Dolan and the author.

ABSTRACT

This paper introduces a notion of "linear functor" between linearly
distributive categories that is general enough to account for common
structure in linear logic, such as the exponentials (!, ?), and the
additives (product, coproduct), and yet when interpreted in the doctrine of
*-autonomous categories, gives the familiar notion of monoidal functor.  We
show that there is a bi-adjunction between the 2--categories of linearly
distributive categories and linear functors, and of *-autonomous categories
and monoidal functors, given by the construction of the "nucleus" of a
linearly distributive category.  We develop a calculus of proof nets for
linear functors, and show how linearity accounts for the essential structure
of the exponentials and the additives.

This paper was first presented at a conference held in Montreal in May 1997,
in honour of Michael Barr's 60th birthday, and is dedicated to him in
celebration of this occasion.

C. Butz and P.T. Johnstone: Classifying toposes for first-order theories
 
Abstract: By a classifying topos for a first-order theory $\Bbb T$, we mean
a topos $\cal E$ such that, for any topos $\cal F$, models of $\Bbb T$ in
$\cal F$ correspond exactly to open geometric morphisms ${\cal F}
\rightarrow{\cal E}$. We show that not every (infinitary) first-order theory
has a classifying topos in this sense, but we characterize those which do by
an appropriate `smallness condition', and we show that every Grothendieck
topos arises as the classifying topos of such a theory. We also show that
every first-order theory has a conservative extension to one which possesses
a classifying topos, and we obtain a Heyting-valued completeness theorem for
infinitary first-order logic.

		On weak higher dimensional categories

	by Claudio Hermida, Michael Makkai and John Power

Abstract: 

Inspired by the concept of opetopic set introduced in a recent paper by
John C. Baez and James Dolan, we give a modified notion called multitopic
set. The name reflects the fact that, whereas the Baez/Dolan concept is
based on operads, the one in this paper is based on multicategories. The
concept of multicategory used here is a mild generalization of the
same-named notion introduced by Joachim Lambek in 1969. Opetopic sets and
multitopic sets are both intended as vehicles for concepts of weak higher
dimensional category. Baez and Dolan define weak n-categories as
(n+1)-dimensional opetopic sets satisfying certain properties. The version
intended here, multitopic n-category, is similarly related to multitopic
sets. Multitopic n-categories are not described in the present paper; they
are to follow in a sequel. The present paper gives complete details of the
definitions and basic properties of the concepts involved in multitopic
sets. The category of multitopes, analogs of opetopes of Baez and Dolan,
is presented in full, and it is shown that the category of multitopic sets
is equivalent to the category of set-valued functors on the category of
multitopes.

For fixed b, b-accessible categories with non-empty limits are

As a corollary, the category of these categories is Cartesian closed.
(Proved independantly by Ad'amek.)
Accessible categories with finite limits are also characterized.

(2) Effective taxonomies and crossed taxonomies

A taxonomy is a "category without identities". This bare structure is
somewhat dull, but "crossed modules of taxonomies" seem more interesting.
In the latter structure, "Dedekind-finite" objects play a role
similar to that of finitely presentable objects in a category.
A notion similar to that of accessibility can thus be defined.

A construction of Lair's in the category of sketches is revisited
and noticed to specialize to the construction of the holomorph
when restricted to groups. The iteration of this construction
reveals two invariants of a sketch: an ordinal and a group.
Some explicit computations are provided.

(4) Cat'egories accessibles `a produits fibr'es

Continuation of (1). Accessible categories with (finite) pullbacks
are characterized in terms of sketches. This is achieved
by introducing "free" colimits in Set: such colimits
are proved to be exactly those that commute with pullbacks.

For fixed b, those b-accessible categories s.t. every diagram with a

Topological Completeness for Higher-Order Logic

by Steve Awodey (awodey@cmu.edu),
   Carsten Butz (butz@brics.dk).

Abstract: Using recent results in topos theory, two systems of
higher-order logic are shown to be complete with respect to sheaf
models over topological spaces---so-called ``topological semantics''.
The first is classical higher-order logic, with relational
quantification of finitely high type; the second system is a
predicative fragment thereof with quantification over functions
between types, but not over arbitrary relations.  The second theorem
applies to intuitionistic as well as classical logic.

Best regards,

Steve Awodey and Carsten Butz

"Functorial Factorization, Well-pointedness and Separabilty"

Abstract: A functorial treatment of factorization structures is presented,
under extensive use of well-pointed endofunctors. Actually, so-called weak
factorization systems are interpreted as pointed lax indexed endofunctors,
and this sheds new light on the correspondence between reflective subcategories
and factorization systems. The second part of the paper presents two improtant
factorization structures in the context of pointed endofunctors:
concordant-dissonant and inseparable-sepaprable.


"Extended Galois Theory And Dissonant Morphisms"

Abstract: For a given Galois structure on a category C and an effective descent
morphism p: E --> B in C we describe the category of so-called weakly split
objects over (E,p) in terms of internal actions of the Galois (pre)groupoid of
(E,p) with an additional structure. We explain that this generates various
known results in categorical Galois theory and in particular two results of M.
Barr and R. Diaconescu. We also give an elaborate list of examples and
applications.

Consider a finitary monad on the category of globular sets. We prove
 that the category of its algebras is isomorphic to the category
 of algebras of an appropriate monad on the
special category (of computads) constructed from the data of the
initial monad. In the case of the free $n$-category monad this
definition coincides with R.Street's definition of $n$-computad. In
the case of a monad generated by a higher operad this allows us to
define a pasting operation in a weak $n$-category. It may be also considered
 as the first step toward the proof of equivalence of the different
 definitions of weak $n$-categories.

Dear Colleagues,

An updated preprint of my paper "Beyond the Chu-construction", which
I presented in Vancouver in July, is now available on my web-page

	http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/koslowski.html

The abstract follows below.

  From a symmetric monoidal closed (= autonomous) category Po-Hsiang
  Chu originally constructed a *-autonomous one, ie, a self-dual
  autonomous category where the duality is realized by means of a
  dualizing object.  Recently, Michael Barr introduced an extension
  for the non-symmetric, but closed, case that after an initial step
  utilized monads and modules between them.  Since these tools are
  well-understood in a bicategorical setting, we introduce a notion
  of local *-autonomy for closed bicategories that turns out to
  be inherited by the bicategories of monads and the bicategory of
  interpolads.  Since the first step of Barr's construction carries
  over directly to the bicategorical setting, we recover his main
  result as an easy corollary.  Furthermore, the Chu-construction at
  this level may be viewed as a procedure to turn the endo-1-cells of
  a bicategory into the objects of a new bicategory, and hence is
  conceptually close to the constructions of bicategories of monads
  and of interpolads.

Groupoids and Crossed Objects in Algebraic Topology
Ronald Brown

Notes for Lectures at the Summer School on the `Foundations of Algebraic 
Topology', Grenoble, June 14 -July 5, 1997 (71 pages). 
Abstract: 
The notes concentrate on the background, intuition, proof and 
applications of the 2-dimensional Van Kampen Theorem 
(for the fundamental crossed module of a pair), with 
sketches of extensions to higher dimensions.
One of the points stressed is how the extension from 
groups to groupoids leads to an extension from the abelian
homotopy groups to non abelian higher dimensional 
generalisations of the fundamental group, as was sought 
by the topologists of the early part of this century. 
This links with J.H.C. Whitehead's efforts to extend 
combinatorial group theory to higher dimensions 
in terms of combinatorial homotopy theory, and which 
analogously motivated his simple homotopy theory.

ABSTRACT

Notions of `operad' and `multicategory' abound. This work provides a single
framework in which many of these various notions can be expressed.
Explicitly: given a monad * on a category S, we define the term
(S,*)-multicategory, subject to certain conditions on S and *.  Different
choices of S and * give some of the existing notions. We then describe the
algebras for an (S,*)-multicategory, and finish with a selection of possible
further developments. Our approach enable concise descriptions of Baez and
Dolan's opetopes and Batanin's operads; both of these are included.

Limits in double categories
by Marco Grandis and Robert Pare

Abstract. We define the notion of (horizontal) double limit for a double
functor  F: I -> A  between double categories, and we give a construction
theorem for such limits, from double products, double equalisers and
tabulators (the double limits of vertical arrows). Double limits can
describe important tools; for instance, the Grothendieck construction of a
profunctor is its tabulator, in the "double category" of categories,
functors and profunctors. If  A  is a 2-category, the previous result
reduces to Street's construction theorem of weighted limits, by ordinary
limits and cotensors  2*X  (the tabulator of the vertical identity of the
object  X).

pointed out that the (simplicial) nerve of the category  Delta  is the

of the terminal omega-category via the comonad generated by the underlying

model for  BigOmega   in terms of trees.  Furthermore, we make connections
with the recent work of Joyal [J].  Full proofs of our claims will appear

(2). Abstract. We introduce the notion of "variation", or  "weak
subobject", in a category, as an extension of the notion of subobject. The
dual notion is called a covariation, or weak quotient.
    Variations are important in homotopy categories, where they are well
linked to weak limits, much in the same way as, in "ordinary" categories,
subobjects are linked to limits. Thus, "homotopy variations" for a space
S,  with respect to the homotopy category  HoTop,  form a lattice  Fib(S)
of "types of fibration" over  S.
    Nevertheless, the study of weak subobjects in ordinary categories, like
abelian groups or groups, is interesting in itself and relevant to classify
variations in homotopy categories of spaces, by means of homology and
homotopy functors.   (To appear in: Cahiers Top. Geom. Diff. Categ.)

(3). Abstract. Formal properties of weak subobjects are considered. The
variations in a category  X  can be identified with the (distinguished)
subobjects in the epi-monic completion of  X,  or Freyd completion  FrX,
the free category with epi-monic factorisation system over  X,  which
extends the Freyd embedding of the stable homotopy category of spaces in an
abelian category (P. Freyd, Stable homotopy, La Jolla 1965).
    If  X  has products and weak equalisers, as  HoTop  and various other
homotopy categories,  FrX  is complete. If  X  has zero-object, weak
kernels and weak cokernels, as the homotopy category of pointed spaces,
then  FrX  is a "homological" category. Finally, if  X  is triangulated,
FrX  is abelian and the embedding  X --> FrX  is the universal homological
functor on  X,  as in the original case. These facts have consequences on
the ordered sets of variations.

From: Alan Jeffrey <alanje@cogs.susx.ac.uk>

I'd like to announce a technical report relating Power and Robinson's
premonoidal categories to a category of mixed data-flow and
control-flow graphs.

   Premonoidal Categories and a Graphical View of Programs

   Alan Jeffrey
   University of Sussex

The report is available electronically from:

   http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/alanje/premon/

Abstract
--------

This paper describes the relationship between two different
presentations of the semantics of programs:

 * Mixed data and control flow graphs are commonly used
   in software engineering as a semi-formal notation for describing
   and analysing algorithms.

 * Category theory is used as an abstract presentation of
   the mathematical structures used to give a formal semantics to
   programs.

In this paper, we formalize an appropriate notion of flow graph,
and show that acyclic flow graphs form the initial 
symmetric premonoidal category.  Thus, giving a semantics
for a programming language in flow graphs uniquely determines 
a semantics in any symmetric premonoidal category.

For languages with recursive definitions, we show that cyclic flow
graphs form the initial partially traced cartesian category.

Finally, we conclude with some more speculative work, showing how
closed structure (to represent higher-order functions) or
two-categorical structure (to represent operational semantics)
might be included in this graphical framework.

The semantics has been implemented as a Java applet, which takes a
program text and draws the corresponding flow graph (all the diagrams
in this paper are drawn using this applet).

The categorical presentation is based on Power and Robinson's
premonoidal categories and Joyal, Street and Verity's monoidal traced
categories, and uses similar techniques to Hasegawa's semantics for
recursive declarations.  The closed and two-categorical structure is
related to Gardner's name-free presentation of Milner's action
calculi.

*Calculus in coinductive form* is not one of those funny calculi where
you can prove anything, just your old Newton-Leibniz-Taylor-Laplace
calculus, with a special emphasis on Taylor and Laplace, and a bit of
categories.

*Guarded induction*, on the other hand, is this logical principle
whereby, to prove a proposition p, you are allowed to use, among other
things, that very same proposition p --- erm, provided, of course,
that you make sure that it is #guarded#. This gives rise to various
funny calculi, and a bit of categories.

(Proper abstracts follow.)

	CALCULUS IN COINDUCTIVE FORM
	by D. Pavlovic and M.H. Escardo

	Abstract.

Coinduction is often seen as a way of implementing infinite objects.
Since real numbers are typical infinite objects, it may not come as a
surprise that calculus, when presented in a suitable way, is permeated
by coinductive reasoning.  What *is* surprising is that mathematical
techniques, recently developed in the context of computer science,
seem to be shedding a new light on some basic methods of calculus.

We introduce a coinductive formalization of elementary calculus that
can be used as a tool for symbolic computation, and geared towards
computer algebra and theorem proving.  So far, we have covered parts
of ordinary differential and difference equations, Taylor series,
Laplace transform and the basics of the operator calculus.



===================================================================

	GUARDED INDUCTION ON FINAL COALGEBRAS
	by D. Pavlovic

	Abstract.

We make an initial step towards categorical semantics of guarded
induction. While ordinary induction is usually modelled in terms of
least fixpoints and initial algebras, guarded induction is based on
*unique* fixpoints of certain operations, called guarded, on *final*
coalgebras. So far, such operations were treated syntactically. We
analyse them categorically. Guarded induction appears as couched in
coinduction.

The applications of the presented categorical analysis span across the
gamut of the applications of coinduction, from modelling of
computation to solving differential equations. A subsequent paper will
provide an account of some domain theoretical aspects, which are
presently left implicit.

Categorification 

John C. Baez and James Dolan

To appear in Proceedings of the Workshop on Higher Category Theory 
and Mathematical Physics at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois,
March 1997, eds. Ezra Getzler and Mikhail Kapranov.

Categorification is the process of finding category-theoretic analogs of
set-theoretic concepts by replacing sets with categories, functions with
functors, and equations between functions by natural isomorphisms
between functors, which in turn should satisfy certain equations of
their own, called `coherence laws'.   Iterating this process requires a
theory of `n-categories', algebraic structures having objects,
morphisms between objects, 2-morphisms between morphisms and so on up to
n-morphisms.  After a brief introduction to n-categories and their
relation to homotopy theory, we discuss algebraic structures that can be
seen as iterated categorifications of the natural numbers and integers.
These include tangle n-categories, cobordism n-categories, and the homotopy 
n-types of the loop spaces Omega^k S^k.  We conclude by describing a 
definition of weak n-categories based on the theory of operads.

	       A Relevant Analysis of Natural Deduction

			 S Ishtiaq and DJ Pym
		   Queen Mary and Westfield College
			 University of London
			{si,pym}@dcs.qmw.ac.uk

  We study a framework, RLF, for defining natural deduction
  presentations of linear and other relevant logics. RLF consists in a
  language together, in a manner similar to that of LF, with a
  representation mechanism. The language of RLF, the
  $\lambda\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus, is a system of first-order linear
  dependent function types which uses a function $\kappa$ to describe
  the degree of sharing of variables between functions and their
  arguments. The representation mechanism is judgements-as-types,
  developed for linear and other relevant logics.  The
  $\lambdal\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus is a conservative extension of the
  $\lambda\Pi$-calculus and RLF is a conservative extension of LF. 


The paper will be available from our Hypatia entries, at
http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk. It is also available at
http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~si.

We are currently engaged in further study of the proof theory of the
$\lambda\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus; this includes setting up a
proposition-as-types correspondence and a Gentzenization of the type
theory. We are also investigating categorical models, specifically
resourced-indexed Kripke models, of the
$\lambda\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus.

                             ========

We generalize the notion of nuclear maps from functional analysis by
defining nuclear ideals in tensored *-categories.  The motivation for
this study came from attempts to generalize the structure of the category
of relations to handle what might be called ``probabilistic relations''.
The compact closed structure associated with the category of relations 
does not generalize directly, instead one obtains nuclear ideals.

Most tensored *-categories have a large class of morphisms
which behave as if they were part of a compact closed category, i.e. they
allow one to transfer variables between the domain and the codomain.  We
introduce the notion of nuclear ideals to analyze these classes of
morphisms.  In compact closed categories, we see that all morphisms
are nuclear, and in the category of Hilbert spaces, the nuclear morphisms
are the Hilbert-Schmidt maps.

We also introduce two new examples of tensored *-categories, in which
integration plays the role of composition. In the first, morphisms are a 
special class of distributions, which we call tame distributions. 
We also introduce a category of probabilistic relations which was 
the original motivating example. 

Finally, we extend the recent work of Joyal, Street and Verity 
on traced monoidal categories to this setting by introducing the notion 
of a trace ideal. For a given symmetric monoidal category, it is not 
generally the case that arbitrary endomorphisms can be assigned a trace. 
However, we can find ideals in the category on which a trace can be 
defined satisfying equations analogous to those of Joyal, Street and 
Verity. We establish a close correspondence between nuclear ideals and 
trace ideals in a tensored *-category, suggested by the correspondence 
between Hilbert-Schmidt operators and trace operators on a Hilbert space. 
When we apply our notion of trace ideal to the category of Hilbert spaces, 
we obtain the usual trace of an endomorphism in the trace class.

ABSTRACT

In the present paper, we develop the notion of a trace operator
on a linearly distributive category, which amounts to essentially
working within a subcategory (the "core") which has the same sort of
"type degeneracy" as a compact closed category.  We also explore the
possibility that an object may have several trace structures,
introducing a notion of compatibility in this case.  We show that
if we restrict to compatible classes of trace operators, an object may
have at most one trace structure (for a given tensor structure). We give
a linearly distributive version of the "geometry of interaction"
construction, and verify that we obtain a linearly distributive category
in which traces become canonical. We explore the relationship between
our notions of trace and fixpoint operators, and show that an object
admits a fixpoint combinator precisely when it admits a trace and is
a cocommutative comonoid. This generalises an observation of Hyland and
Hasegawa.

This paper is presented to Bill Lawvere on the occasion of his 60th

"Topological representation of the lambda-calculus"

S. Awodey

Abstract: The lambda-calculus can be represented  topologically by
assigning certain spaces to the types and certain  continuous maps to the
terms.  Using a recent result from topos theory, the usual calculus of
lambda-conversion is shown to be  deductively complete with respect to such
topological
semantics.  It is also shown to be functionally complete, in  the sense
that there is always a ``minimal'' topological model, in  which every
continuous function is lambda-definable.  These  results subsume earlier
ones using cartesian closed categories, as  well as those employing
so-called Henkin and Kripke lambda-models.

In a nut-shell, the point is that the Butz-Moerdijk spatial covering
theorem for topoi can be used to embed any CCC fully and faithfully (and
CC) into a topos of sheaves on a space.  So the "topological semantics"
mentioned are actually in such topoi of sheaves.

		Structures in Higher-Dimensional Category Theory

This is an exposition of some of the constructions which have arisen in
higher-dimensional category theory. We start with a review of the general
theory of operads and multicategories. Using this we give an account of
Batanin's definition of n-category; we also give an informal definition in
pictures. Next we discuss Gray-categories and their place in coherence
problems. Finally, we present various constructions relevant to the opetopic
definitions of n-category.

New material includes a suggestion for a definition of lax cubical
n-category; a characterization of small Gray-categories as the small
substructures of 2-Cat; a conjecture on coherence theorems in higher
dimensions; a construction of the category of trees and, more generally, of
n-pasting diagrams; and an analogue of the Baez-Dolan slicing process in the
general theory of operads.

A Homology Theory for Etale Groupoids
       by Marius Crainic and Ieke Moerdijk

In this paper we introduce a homology theory for etale groupoids, dual to
Haefliger's cohomology theory (via Poincare duality).  We prove basic facts
like Morita invariance, Leray spectral sequence, Verdier duality. We also
outline the application to the computation of cyclic homology of the
convolution algebra of the groupoid (including the non-Hausdorff situation).
An appendix about "compact supports" on non-Hausdorff manifolds is added.

EXPONENTIABILITY AND SINGLE UNIVERSES
by Marta BUNGE and Susan NIEFIELD

ABSTRACT - The search for suitable single universes for opposite or dual
pairs of notions (such as those of discrete fibration and discrete
opfibration, or of open and closed inclusions, or of functions and
distributions on a Grothendieck topos) leads naturally to
exponentiability.  Using exponentiability techniques, such as
model-generated categories and glueing, we settle a standing conjecture
and an open problem.  The conjecture, due to F. Lamarche, states that for
a small category B, the category of unique factorization liftings (also
known as discrete Conduche fibrations) over B is a topos.  We also
construct the smallest topos containing the local homeomorphisms
(functions) and the complete spreads (distributions) over any given topos
satisfying a certain condition (true of presheaf toposes).  This solves a
problem posed by F. W. Lawvere.  Along the way, we introduce two new sorts
of geometric morphisms, characterize locally closed inclusions in Cat,
and investigate new features of generalized coverings in topos theory,
such as branched coverings, cuts, and complete spreads.

Dear collegues,

the following  preprint

"Computads for finitary monads on globular sets"

is available at

http://www-math.mpce.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/papers.html

>From  Introduction.

This work arose as a reflection on the foundation of higher
dimensional category theory. One of the main ingredients of any
proposed definition of weak $n$-category is the shape of diagrams
(pasting scheme) we
accept to be composable. In a globular approach \cite{Bat} each
$k$-cell
has a source and target  $(k-1)$-cell. In the opetopic approach of
Baez and Dolan \cite{BD} and the multitopic approach of Hermida,
Makkai
and Power \cite{HMP} each $k$-cell has a unique $(k-1)$-cell as
target
and a whole $(k-1)$-dimensional pasting diagram  as source.
In the theory of strict $n$-categories both source and target may be a
general pasting diagram \cite{J,StH, StP}.

 The globular approach
being the simplest one
seems too restrictive to describe the combinatorics of higher
dimensional compositions. Yet, we argue  that this is a false
impression. Moreover, we prove that this approach is a basic
one from which the other type of composable diagrams may be derived.
One  theorem proved here asserts that the category of algebras of
a finitary monad on the category of $n$-globular sets is {\bf
equivalent} to the category of algebras of an appropriate monad on
the
special category (of computads) constructed from the data of the
original monad. In the case of the monad derived from the universal
contractible operad \cite{Bat} this result may be interpreted as the
equivalence of the definitions of weak $n$-categories (in the sense
of \cite{Bat}) based on the
`globular' and general pasting diagrams. It may be also considered
 as the first step toward the proof of equivalence of the different
 definitions of weak $n$-category.


We also develop a general theory of computads and investigate some
properties of the category of generalized computads. It turned out,
that in a good situation this category is a topos (and even a presheaf
topos under some not very restrictive conditions, the property firstly
observed by S.Schanuel and reproved by A,Carboni and P.Johnstone for
$2$-computads in the sense of Street).

EXPONENTIABILITY AND SINGLE UNIVERSES
by Marta BUNGE and Susan NIEFIELD

ABSTRACT - In this paper, we first consider known universes for pairs of
opposite notions such as those of discrete fibrations/discrete
opfibrations and of open/closed locale inclusions, and then extrapolate
these in order to introduce new single universes for open/closed
inclusions of subcategories and for functions/distributions on a topos.  A
key factor that these notions have in common is exponentiability in the
ambient category.  Along the way, we (1) prove that, for a factorization
linearly ordered small category B, the category of discrete
Giraud-Conduche fibrations over B is a (model generated) topos, (2)
characterize locally closed inclusions in the category Cat of small
categories, (3) investigate ``generalized coverings'' in topos theory,
including branched coverings, cuts, and complete spreads, and (4) examine
the preservations of exponetiability under the passage from Cat/B to the
category of Grothendieck toposes over the presheaves PB.

Subject: categories: The Logic of Bunched Implications. 

We, Peter O'Hearn and David Pym, are pleased to announce
our new paper, ``The Logic of Bunched Implications''.

We hope it will be of interest to readers of `categories'.  BI
is a relevant logic which extends both linear and intuitionistic
logic. It has a semantics of proofs based on `doubly closed categories',

which carry two monoidal closed structures, one of which is cartesian
in models of BI. A rich class of models is provided by Day's tensor
product construction on  the category of presheaves over a small
monoidal category. It also comes with a lambda calculus, a truth
semantics
and a computational interpretation as a logic of resources, quite
different from
that of linear logic.

Abstract.

Introduce a logic BI in which a multiplicative (or linear)
and an additive (or intuitionistic) implication live side by
side. The propositional version of BI arises from an analysis
of the proof-theoretic relationship between conjunction and
implication, and may be viewed as a merging of intuitionistic
logic and multiplicative, intuitionistic linear logic. The
predicate version of BI includes, in addition to standard
additive quantifiers, multiplicative (or intensional)
quantifiers ``forall-new'' and ``exist-new'' which arise from
observing restrictions on structural rules on the level of terms
as well as propositions. We discuss computational interpretations,
based on sharing, at both the propositional and predicate levels.

Subject: categories: Injectives via KZ-monads
From: "Martin Escardo" <mhe@dcs.ed.ac.uk>

The following short paper is available from my home page:

	http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe/pub/papers/top97.ps.gz
or
        http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe/papers.html

(It is an updated version of a paper which was previously circulated
in other lists.)

		=====================================
		Injective spaces via the filter monad
======================================================================
An injective space is a topological space with a strong extension
property for continuous maps with values on it. A certain filter space
construction embeds every T_0 topological space into an injective
space.  The construction gives rise to a monad. We show that the monad
is of the Kock-Zoberlein type and apply this to obtain a simple proof
of the fact that the algebras are the continuous lattices (Alan Day,
1975, Oswald Wyler, 1976).  In previous work we established an
injectivity theorem for monads of this type, which characterizes the
injective objects over a certain class of embeddings as the
algebras. For the filter monad, the class turns out to consist
precisely of the subspace embeddings.  We thus obtain as a corollary
that the injective spaces over subspace embeddings are the continuous
lattices endowed with the Scott topology (Dana Scott, 1972).  Similar
results are obtained for continuous Scott domains, which are
characterized as the injective spaces over dense subspace embeddings,
via the proper filter monad.
======================================================================
Two notes (and some questions concerning credit)
=========

(i) Bob Flagg and I have also considered the following variations on
the filter monad (a report is being written)

  (a) Category: T_0 exponentiable spaces 
          (= core-compact = open sets form a continuous lattice)

      Restriction on filters: Scott open.

      => Associated maps: "semi-proper" embeddings
          (= right adjoint of the frame maps preserve directed joins)

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over semi-proper):
          continuous meet-semilattices with Scott topology. 

      (Corollary: continuous meet-semilattices and Scott continuous
       functions form a CCC. Was this known before?)

      This characterization of the algebras was previously known
      (Andrea Shalk--anyone else?), but the "KZ-method" outlined 
      in the above abstract gives a much shorter proof.

  (b) Category: T_0 spaces 

      Restriction on filters: prime.

      => Associated maps: flat embeddings
          (= right adjoint of the frame maps preserve finite joins)

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over flat):
          compact, stably locally compact spaces. 

      (A localic version is given via the ideal monad. What Johnstone
       refers to as Joyal's Lemma appears as a special case of this.)

      (I don't know what was previously known about this.)

      (A result by Isbell (in his paper "Flat = prosupersplit")
      implies that the flat embeddings form the largest class of 
      embeddings over which the CSLCSs are injective, because
      finite spaces are (trivially) CSLCSs.)

  (c) Category: T_0 spaces 

      Restriction on filters: completely prime.

      => Associated maps: "completely flat" embeddings
          (= right adjoint of the frame maps preserve all joins)

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over completely flat):
          sober spaces. 

  (d) Category: T_0 locally connected spaces  

      Restriction on filters: filters of connected open sets.

      => Associated maps: "locally dense" embeddings
          (= frame maps preserve connectedness (and hence right 
           adjoints preserve disjoint unions))

      => Algebras (and hence injectives over locally dense):
          L-domains. 

      (This was obtained by Bob, based on some previous work by
       Paul Taylor (and Andrea Shalk) on the algebras. Again, the 
       KZ-method gives a simpler proof of the characterization.)

(ii) The filter monad is formally analogous to the so-called
continuation monad, as it is observed (with the formal details of the
analogy) in the paper being advertised.

I would like to also mention that the general injectivity result for
KZ-monads referred to in the above abstract was established in the
paper

        http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe/pub/papers/injective.ps.gz

which is (mainly) about continuity of the extension process (answering
a question by Scott in his 1972 paper on continuous lattices).

Comments are wellcome.

presents background material motivated from the point of view of computer
science.  In Section 2, the category UFL of unique factorisation lifting
(ufl) functors is recalled and its basic properties are studied. Section 3
explores applications of ufl functors to concurrency.  In particular we
show that they may be used in the study of interleaving models like
transition systems.  In Section 4, we introduce triangulated categories.
Our main use for them is in Section 5 where, for C a triangulated category,
we exhibit the category UFL/C as a sheaf topos. These toposes may be
regarded as models of linearly-controlled processes.  Some
concluding remarks are provided in Section 6.

"An intrinsic homotopy theory for simplicial complexes
with applications to image processing"

is available at:

as:   Lnk.Nov98.ps

***

Abstract. A simplicial complex is a set equipped with a down-closed family
of distinguished finite subsets; this structure is mostly viewed as
codifying a triangulated space. Here, this structure is used directly to
describe "spaces" of interest in various applications, where the associated
triangulated space would be misleading. An intrinsic homotopy theory, not
based on topological realisation, is introduced.
        The applications considered here are aimed at metric spaces and
digital topology; concretely, at image processing and computer graphics. A
metric space  X  has a structure  t_e(X)  of simplicial complex at each
"resolution"  e > 0;  the resulting n-homotopy group  \pi_n(t_e(X))  detects
those singularities which can be captured by an n-dimensional grid, with
edges bound by  e;  this works equally well for continuous or discrete
regions of euclidean spaces.

***

Comments would be appreciated.

In particular, I am uneasy about a question of terminology.

In my opinion, the term "simplicial complex", quite appropriate when the
structure is viewed as codifying a triangulated space, is unfit when such
objects are treated as "spaces" in themselves (somewhat close to
bornological spaces, which have similar axioms on objects and maps).

In other words, "simplicial complex" should not refer to the category
itself, say  C,  but to its usual embedding in  Top,  the simplicial
realisation. The two aspects may clash, e.g. with respect to initial or
final structures: the coarse C-object on three points (final structure, all
parts are distinguished) is realised as a euclidean triangle; a C-subobject
is sufficient to produce a topological subspace (a regular subobject in
Top), but a C-subspace (a regular subobject in  C)  is a stronger notion.
Moreover, from a more concrete point of view, the simplicial realisation is
quite inappropriate in most of the applications considered in this work.

The opposition  "C-object / simplicial complex" is in part similar to
"sequence / series": the second term refers to a more specific view & use
of the same data; the clashing of the opposition is particularly evident in
the notions of convergence, for a sequence or a series.

That's why I am calling a C-object a "combinatorial space". (The term
"combinatorial complex" has also been used for simplicial complex; and I
wanted a term of the form "attribute + space", to use freely of topological
terms like discrete, coarse, subspace...)
But of course it is embarassing to propose a new term for a classical notion.

category of compact stably locally compact locales and perfect maps
with the category of compact regular biframes and biframe

Higher-Dimensional Algebra IV: 2-Tangles
John C. Baez, Laurel Langford

Just as knots and links can be algebraically described as certain
morphisms in the category of tangles in 3 dimensions, compact surfaces
smoothly embedded in R^4 can be described as certain 2-morphisms in
the 2-category of `2-tangles in 4 dimensions'.   Using the work of
Carter, Rieger and Saito, we prove that this 2-category is the `free
semistrict braided monoidal 2-category with duals on one unframed
self-dual object'.  By this universal property, any unframed self-dual
object in a braided monoidal 2-category with duals determines an
invariant of 2-tangles in 4 dimensions.

Our main result is a description of the covers of this subtopos as a

including topos.  We also have some new results concerning the general
theory of KZ-doctrines, such as the closure under composition of discrete
fibrations for a KZ-doctrine, in the sense of Bunge-Funk.

  Axioms and (Counter)examples in Synthetic Domain Theory

  by Jaap van Oosten and Alex K. Simpson

ABSTRACT: Chapter 1 presents a development of basic Synthetic Domain
Theory on the basis of 4 axioms (1:\Sigma is complete; 2:\Sigma is
\neg\neg-separated; 3:\bot\in\Sigma; 4:the Phoa Principle). New results
are, that 1 and 2 imply that the \Sigma-order on \Sigma , I and F (the
initial lift algebra and the final lift coalgebra, respectively) is
(pointwise) implication, that 1 and 2 imply that complete extensional
objects (we call them complete regular \Sigma-posets) are stable under 
lifting, that under 1,2,3, axiom 4 is equivalent to \Sigma having binary
joins, and that if \Sigma is closed under N-idexed joins in \Omega, then
all complete objects are stable under lifting. We also present an analysis
of when I is an internal colimit of a diagram 0->L(0)->L^2(0)->...

Chapters 2,3,4 investigate models. We study models of the axioms in: the
Modified realizability topos Mod, the Effective topos Eff, and a particular
Grothendieck topos. In Mod, the Scott principle fails and L(2) is not
complete. In Eff, we have that the internal colimit of 0->L(0)->L^2(0)->...
is complete (whence it is not isomorphic to I), and a general theorem
characterizing I for \neg\neg-separated dominances. Finally, in a sheaf
topos we have an example where L(2) is complete but L(N) isn't.

    Towards semantics of guarded induction
    by Dusko Pavlovic


    Abstract.

We analyze guarded induction, a coalgebraic method for implementing
abstract data types with infinite elements (e.g. various dynamic
systems, continuous or discrete). It is widely used not just in
computation, but also, tacitly, in many basic constructions of
differential calculus. However, while syntactic characterisations
abound, only the very first steps towards a formal semantics have been
made. A language independent analysis was recently initiated, but just
special cases were covered so far.

In the present paper, we propose a new approach, based on a somewhat
unusual
combination of monads and polynomial categories. The first result is
what appears to be a precise semantic characterisation of guarded
operators on arbitrary final coalgebras.

This thesis concentrates on the development and application of Groebner bases
methods to a range of combinatorial problems (involving groups, semigroups,
categories, category actions, algebras and K-categories).
Chapter Two contains the generalisation of rewriting and 
Knuth-Bendix procedures to Kan extensions.
Chapter Three shows that the standard Knuth-Bendix algorithm is 
step-for-step a special case of the Buchberger's algorithm for noncommutative
Groebner bases. 
The one-sided cases and higher dimensions are considered, and the relations
between these are made precise.
Chapter Four relates rewrite systems, Groebner bases and automata.
Reduction machines for rewrite systems are identified with standard 
output 
automata and the reduction machines devised for algebras are expressed as
Petri-nets.
Chapter Five introduces logged rewriting for group presentations. 
The completion of a logged rewriting system for a group  
determines a partial contracting homotopy which enables the computation 
of a set
of generators for the module of identities among relations using the 
covering 
groupoid methods devised by Brown and Razak Sallah. 
Reducing the resulting set of submodule generators is identified as a
Groebner basis problem.

    Lambda Definability with Sums via Grothendieck Logical Relations

                 by Marcelo Fiore and Alex Simpson

    We introduce a notion of *Grothendieck logical relation* and use 
    it to characterise the definability of morphisms in *stable* bicartesian
    closed categories by terms of the simply-typed lambda calculus with 
    finite products and finite sums. Our techniques are based on concepts 
    from topos theory, however our exposition is elementary.


The paper is written in a style appropriate for the conference

    Typed Lambda-Calculi and Applications

where it is to be presented in April. However, we briefly discuss
the true categorical content of the paper, which will be further 
expanded upon in a full version of the paper (forthcoming).

Pierce Topologies of Extensive Categories

by Zhaohua Luo

Abstraction

An extensive category is a category with finite stable disjoint sums. In
this note we show that each extensive category carries a natural
subcanonical coherent Grothendieck topology defined by injections of
sums. This Grothendieck topology is induced by a strict metric topology,
which is a functor to the category of  Stone spaces. We call this metric
topology the Pierce topology of the category, as it generalizes the
classical Pierce spectrums of commutative rings. Recall that the Pierce
spectrum of a commutative ring R is the spectrum of the Boolean algebra
of idempotents of R, which is a Stone space. A theorem of R. S. Pierce
states that R can be represented as the ring of global sections of a
sheaf of commutative rings on its Pierce spectrum (called the Pierce
sheaf or representation), whose stalks are indecomposable rings (with
respect to product decomposations). Diers showed that Pierce's theorem
can be extended to any object in a locally finitely presentable category
such that the opposite of the subcategory of finitely presentable
objects is lextensive (called a locally indecomposable category). We
shall see that a weak form of Pierce representation exists for any
object in an extensive category.

          Computational Adequacy in an Elementary Topos

  We place simple axioms on an elementary topos which suffice for it to 
  provide a denotational model of call-by-value PCF with sum and product
  types. The model is synthetic in the sense that types are interpreted
  by their set-theoretic counterparts within the topos. The main result
  characterises when the model is computationally adequate with respect
  to the operational semantics of the programming language. We prove that
  computational adequacy holds if and only if the topos is $1$-consistent
  (i.e. its internal logic validates only true $\Sigma^0_1$-sentences).

This paper is to appear in the forthcoming proceedings of CSL 98.

Subject: categories: Generalized Enrichment
Date: Fri, 29 Jan 1999 12:29:26 +0000 (GMT)
From: Tom Leinster <T.Leinster@dpmms.cam.ac.uk>

The following is now available, at http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~leinster/


Generalized Enrichment for Categories and Multicategories

In this paper we answer the question: `what kind of a structure can a general
multicategory be enriched in?' (Here `general multicategory' is used in the
sense of the author, Burroni or Hermida.) The answer is, in a sense to
be made precise, that a multicategory of one type can be enriched in a
multicategory of the type one level up. In particular, we will be able to
speak of a T_n-multicategory enriched in a T_{n+1}-multicategory, where
T_n is the monad expressing the pasting-together of n-opetopes.

The answer for general multicategories reduces to something surprising in the
case of ordinary categories: a category may be enriched in an
`fc-multicategory', a very general kind of 2-dimensional structure
encompassing monoidal categories, plain multicategories, bicategories and
double categories. It turns out that fc-multicategories also provide a
natural setting for the bimodules construction. We also explore enrichment
for some multicategories other than just categories. An extended application
is given: the relaxed multicategories of Borcherds and Soibelman are
explained in terms of enrichment.

A heavily revised version of my paper "Beyond the Chu-construction"
is now available from my home page:

	http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/~koslowj/RESEARCH/

It will eventually be published in Applied Categorical Structures.
I have not attempted to attribute the term "dualizing object" to anyone
in particular.  The open problem of an earlier version, as to whether
Cauchy-complete bicategories of interpolads inherit local *-autonomy 
from their base, has been answered affirmatively.  

Here is the abstract:


  Starting from symmetric monoidal closed (= autonomous) categories,
  Po-Hsiang Chu showed how to construct new *-autonomous categories,
  i.e., autonomous categories that are self-dual because of a
  dualizing object.  Recently, Michael Barr extended this to the
  non-symmetric, but closed, case, utilizing monads and modules
  between them.  Since these notions are well-understood for
  bicategories, we introduce a notion of local *-autonomy for these
  that implies closedness and, moreover, is inherited when forming
  bicategories of monads and of interpolads.  Since the initial step
  of Barr's construction also carries over to the bicategorical
  setting, we recover his main result as an easy corollary.
  Furthermore, the Chu-construction at this level may be viewed as a
  procedure for turning the endo-1-cells of a closed bicategory into
  the objects of a new closed bicategory, and hence conceptually is
  similar to constructing bicategories of monads and of interpolads.

Higher-Dimensional Algebra and Planck-Scale Physics

to appear in "Physics Meets Philosophy at the Planck Scale", eds. 
Craig Callender and Nick Huggett, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge.

This is a nontechnical introduction to recent work on quantum gravity
that uses ideas from higher-dimensional algebra.  We argue that reconciling
general relativity with the Standard Model requires a `background-free
quantum theory with local degrees of freedom propagating causally'.  We
describe the insights provided by work on topological quantum field theories
such as quantum gravity in 3-dimensional spacetime.  These are background-free
quantum theories lacking local degrees of freedom, so they only display some
of the features we seek.  However, they suggest a deep link between the
concepts of `space' and `state', and similarly those of `spacetime' and
`process', which we argue is to be expected in any background-free quantum
theory.  We sketch how higher-dimensional algebra provides the mathematical
tools to make this link precise.  Finally, we comment on attempts to formulate
a theory of quantum gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime using `spin networks'
and `spin foams'.

Subject: categories: Paper Announcement: Control Categories and Duality
Date: Tue, 23 Feb 1999 00:09:47 -0500 (EST)

Dear Category Theorists,

The paper "Control Categories and Duality: on the Categorical
Semantics of the Lambda-Mu Calculus" is now available from

 http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~selinger/papers.html
 http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/SelingerP

This is a revised and improved version of a paper I presented at
MFPS'98.

Let me briefly summarize the part of the paper that I think will be
the most interesting to category theorists; the actual abstract is
appended at the end.

Consider a category C with distributive finite products and coproducts
and a distinguished object R, such that all exponentials of the form
R^A exist. Let R^C denote the full subcategory of C consisting of
objects of the form R^A. It is an old observation that R^C is
cartesian-closed. This observation is at the heart of continuation
passing style (CPS) interpretations of programming languages with
control operators, and it has been used recently by Hofmann and
Streicher to give a sound and complete categorical model of Parigot's
lambda-mu calculus.  (The lambda-mu calculus generalizes the
simply-typed lambda calculus; it is a proof term calculus for
propositional classical logic).

In this paper, I give an independent, algebraic characterization of
the structure of categories of the form R^C. By "independent", I mean
that it does not depend on an ambient category C, and by "algebraic",
that it is given in terms of operations and equations only.  The
crucial structure that R^C has, besides cartesian closure, is an
operation called "classical disjunction" that takes R^A and R^B to
R^(AxB). This operation is functorial in each argument, but not
bifunctorial; it forms a premonoidal structure in the sense of Power
and Robinson. Abstracting from R^C, I define the class of "control
categories", which are cartesian-closed categories with a premonoidal
structure and suitable axioms. The presence of an operation which is
not bifunctorial leads to some interesting twists, as one has to be a
bit careful about how one defines concepts such as weak
structure-preserving functors and equivalences of categories.

The main theorem is a structure theorem, which shows that every
control category is equivalent to a category of the form R^C (and, of
course, vice versa).

An algebraic class of categories calls out for an internal language. I
prove that the call-by-name lambda-mu calculus (with product and
disjunction types) forms an internal language for control
categories. Thus, these categories can be considered as models for (a
certain kind of) proof theory of classical logic.  Also, the
call-by-value lambda-mu-calculus forms an internal language for the
dual class of co-control categories. As a consequence of this
categorical duality, it follows that there is a syntactic duality
between the call-by-name and the call-by-value calculus, i.e., there
are mutually inverse translations between call-by-name and
call-by-value that preserve the categorical (and also the operational)
semantics.  Such dualities have been observed in a different setting
by Filinski. In the case of the lambda-mu calculus, such a syntactic
duality was conjectured by Streicher and Reus.

Comments are welcome.

Best wishes, -- Peter Selinger

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ABSTRACT: 

We give a categorical semantics to the call-by-name and call-by-value
versions of Parigot's lambda-mu calculus with disjunction types. We
introduce the class of control categories, which combine a
cartesian-closed structure with a premonoidal structure in the sense
of Power and Robinson.  We prove, via a categorical structure theorem,
that the categorical semantics is equivalent to a CPS semantics in the
style of Hofmann and Streicher. We show that the call-by-name
lambda-mu calculus forms an internal language for control categories,
and that the call-by-value lambda-mu calculus forms an internal
language for the dual co-control categories. As a corollary, we obtain
a syntactic duality result: there exist syntactic translations between
call-by-name and call-by-value which are mutually inverse and which
preserve the operational semantics.  This answers a question of
Streicher and Reus.

Abstract :   We associate to any (strict) multiple category $\C$ three
homology theories : the first one is called the globular homology
and it contains the oriented loops of $\C$ ; both other ones are called
corner homology, the
negative one and the positive one, which contain the corners included
in $\C$. We show up the link between this homology theories and the
homotopy of paths in multiple category.  At the end of the paper, we
explain the reason why this theories are interesting for some

Introduction to linear bicategories

by J.R.B. Cockett, J. Koslowski, R.A.G. Seely

Linear bicategories are a generalization of the notion of a bicategory,
in which the one horizontal composition is replaced by two (linked)
horizontal compositions. These compositions provide a semantic model for
the tensor and par of linear logic: in particular, as composition is
fundamentally noncommutative, they provides a suggestive source of
models for noncommutative linear logic.

In a linear bicategory, the logical notion of complementation becomes a
natural linear notion of adjunction. Just as ordinary adjoints are
related to (Kan) extensions, these linear adjoints are related to the
appropriate notion of linear extension.

There is also a stronger notion of complementation, which arises, for
example, in cyclic linear logic. This sort of complementation is
modelled by cyclic adjoints. This leads to the notion of a *-linear
bicategory and the coherence conditions which it must satisfy. Cyclic
adjoints also give rise to linear monads: these are, essentially, the
appropriate generalization (to the linear setting) of Frobenius
algebras.

A number of examples of linear bicategories arising from different
sources are described, and a number of constructions which result in
linear bicategories are indicated.

This paper is dedicated to Jim Lambek, as part of the celebration of his
75th birthday.

       The purpose of this paper is to make the theory of vertex algebras
trivial. We do this by
       setting up some categorical machinery so that vertex algebras are
just ``singular
       commutative rings'' in a certain category. This makes it easy to
construct many examples of
       vertex algebras, in particular by using an analogue of the
construction of a twisted group ring
       from a bicharacter of a group. We also define quantum vertex
algebras as singular braided
       rings in the same category and construct some examples of them. The
constructions work
       just as well for higher dimensional analogues of vertex algebras.

The basic method of rewriting for words in a free monoid given a 
monoid presentation is extended to rewriting for paths in a free 
category given a `Kan extension presentation'. This is related to 
work of Carmody-Walters on the Todd-Coxeter procedure for Kan extensions, 
but allows for the output data to be infinite, described by a language. 
The result also allows rewrite methods to be applied in a
greater range of situations and examples, in terms of induced  actions of 
monoids, categories, groups or groupoids. (28kb)

number of processes is never a factor in the system correctness.  
This paper embodies such an engineering reasoning to 
propose an almost automatic method to safely verify 
safety properties of such systems.  
The central idea is to construct a finite collective quotient structure
(CQS) which collapses state-space representations for all system
implementations with all numbers of processes.  
The problem is presented as safety bound problem which ask if 
the number of processes satisfying a certain property exceeds a given bound.  
Our method can be applied to systems with dynamic linear lists of unknown
number of processes.  
Processes can be deleted from or inserted at any position of the linear list 
during transitions.  
We have used our method to develop CQS constructing algorithms for 
two classes of concurrent systems : 
(1) untimed systems with a global waiting queue and 
(2) dense-time systems with one local timer per process.  
We show that our method is both sound and complete in verifying the 
first class of systems.  
The verification problem for the second class systems is 
undecidable even with only one global binary variable.
However, our method can still automatically generate a 
CQS of size no more than 1512 nodes to 
verify that an algorithm in the class: Fischer's timed 
algorithm indeed preserves mutual exclusion for any number of processes.

A systematic treatment of weak bisimulation and observational congruence on
presheaf models is presented.  The theory is developed with respect to a
``hiding'' functor from a category of paths to observable paths.  Via a view
of processes as bundles, we are able to account for weak morphisms (roughly
only required to preserve observable paths) and to derive a saturation monad
(on the category of presheaves over the category of paths).  Weak morphisms
may be encoded as strong ones via the Kleisli construction associated to the
saturation monad.  A general notion of weak open-map bisimulation is
introduced, and results relating various notions of strong and weak
bisimulation are provided.  The abstract theory is accompanied by the concrete
study of two key models for concurrency, the interleaving model of
synchronisation trees and the independence model of labelled event structures.

  
Comments are welcome.

Combinatorial homology and image analysis
M. Grandis
  
ABSTRACT. This is the sequel of a paper, cited as Part I ("An intrinsic
homotopy theory for simplicial complexes, with applications to image
analysis"), introducing intrinsic homotopies and homotopy groups for
simplicial complexes. We study here the relations of this intrinsic
homotopy theory with the well-known intrinsic homology theory of simplicial
complexes.
     Also here, the applications are aimed at image analysis. A metric
space  X  has a structure  t_e(X)  of simplicial complex at each resolution
e > 0;  the corresponding *metric combinatorial homology groups*  H_n(
t_e(X)) can be directly computed, in cases of interest for applications,
via the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence and a study of deformation retracts
given in Part I.

     Abstract: We introduce the notion of representable multicategory,
which stands in the same relation to that of monoidal category as
fibration does to contravariant pseudofunctor (into Cat). We give an
abstract reformulation of multicategories as monads in a suitable Kleisli
bicategory of spans. We describe representability in elementary terms via
universal arrows.  We also give a doctrinal characterisation of
representability based on a fundamental monadic adjunction between the
2-category of multicategories and that of strict monoidal categories. The
first main result is the coherence theorem for representable
multicategories, asserting their equivalence to strict ones, which we
establish via a new technique based on the above doctrinal
characterisation. The other main result is a 2-equivalence between the
2-category of representable multicategories and that of monoidal
categories and strong monoidal functors. This correspondence extends
smoothly to one between bicategories and a localised version of
representable multicategories.

Hi,
Recently I presented in the Hewlett Packard conference  HiPer'99  the
paper
    "Translating Mathematica expressions to High Performance Fortran"
with the following abstract:

This paper introduces some ideas for translating the functional language
Mathematica to the data-parallel language High Performance Fortran
(HPF). It first discusses why we have the ability to do that. Then it
gives some interpretations by Category Theory. Third the translating
approach is presented for different Mathematica expressions that could
be interpreted as specifications for parallel independence, reduction,
task parallelism and
subprogram's data mapping. Last is shown a simple executable program
generated by the translator.

You can find more about that on
http://www.imm.dtu.dk./~aaa/MathematicaToHPF.html   .

I am glad that Category theory exists! With it I was able to express
that Functional, Object-oriented and Parallel programing are the same
kind of management.

Date: Sat, 31 Jul 1999 00:45:43 -0400 (EDT)

Dear Category Theorists,

I am pleased to announce the availability of a new paper,

	Categorical Structure of Asynchrony,

available via http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~selinger/papers.html.

In this paper, I investigate properties of traced monoidal categories
that are satisfied by networks of asynchronously communicating
processes. Among these properties are Hasegawa's uniformity principle,
as well as a version of Kahn's principle: the subcategory of
*deterministic* processes is equivalent to a category of domains.

The paper also contains the following observation, which may be of
interest to categorists. I do not know whether this was observed
before, and would be grateful for references. Suppose T:Set-->Set is a
functor which is lax for the symmetric monoidal structure given by
products on the category of sets. Then T associates to any category C
another category C', which Benabou called the "direct image of C by
T". This category is defined as follows:

 obj(C') = obj(C),   and  C'(X,Y) = T(C(X,Y)).

The observation is that direct images preserve linear structure. More
precisely, if the category C possesses some algebraic structure which
is given by linear equations, then C' inherits that structure.
Non-linear structure is not in general preserved, although one can
give conditions on T under which the construction will preserve, for
instance, affine structure. One can also loosen the conditions on T,
so that it will only preserve non-commutative linear structure.

One can use the direct image construction to extract the linear "part"
of an arbitrary algebraic structure: for instance, if C has finite
products, then C' has a monoidal structure with diagonals, which is
precisely the part of a finite product structure which is given by
linear equations.

Traced monoidal structure with diagonals is the linear part of finite
product structure with fixpoints. One direction of this, namely that
the latter structure is a special case of the former, was observed by
Hasegawa and by Hyland, but I don't know whether it had been noticed
that the former is precisely the linear part of the latter.

An example of a non-commutative linear structure (given by linear
equations where the variables occur in the same left-to-right order on
both sides) is the premonoidal structure of Power and Robinson. This
is precisely the non-commutative part of monoidal structure. 

More details and examples are in the paper. Comments are, as usual,
welcome. Best wishes, -- Peter Selinger

ABSTRACT:

We investigate a categorical framework for the semantics of
asynchronous communication in networks of parallel processes.
Abstracting from a category of asynchronous labeled transition
systems, we formulate the notion of a categorical model of asynchrony
as a uniformly traced monoidal category with diagonals, such that
every morphism is total and the focus is equivalent to a category of
complete partial orders. We present a simple, non-deterministic,
cpo-based model that satisfies these requirements, and we discuss how
to refine this model by an observational congruence. We also present a
general construction of passing from deterministic to
non-deterministic models, and more generally, from non-linear to
linear structure on a category.

	The multitopic omega-category of all multitopic omega-categories

			by M. Makkai (McGill University)

				September 2, 1999


Abstract

The paper gives two definitions: that of "multitopic omega-category" and
that of "the (large) multitopic set of all (small) multitopic
omega-categories". It also announces the theorem that the latter is a
multitopic omega-category. (The proof of the theorem will be contained in
a sequel to this paper.)

The work has two direct sources. One is the paper [H/M/P] (for the
references, see at the end of this abstract) in which, among others, the
concept of "multitopic set" was introduced. The other is the present
author's work on FOLDS, First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts. The
latter was reported on in [M2]. A detailed account of the work on FOLDS is
in [M3]. For the understanding of the present paper, what is contained in
[M2] suffices. In fact, section 1 of the present paper gives the
definitions of all that's needed in this paper; so, probably, there won't
be even a need to consult [M2]. 

The concept of multitopic set, the main contribution of [H/M/P], was, in
turn, inspired by the work of J. Baez and J. Dolan [B/D]. Multitopic sets
are a variant of opetopic sets of loc. cit. The name "multitopic set"
refers to multicategories, a concept originally due to J. Lambek [L], and
given an only moderately generalized formulation in [H/M/P]. The earlier
"opetopic set" of [B/D] is based on a concept of operad. I should say that
the exact relationship of the two concepts ("multitopic set" and "opetopic
set") is still not clarified. The main aspect in which the theory of
multitopic sets is in a more advanced state than that of opetopic sets is
that, in [H/M/P], there is an explicitly defined category Mlt of
*multitopes*, with the property that the category of multitopic sets is
equivalent to the category of Set-valued functors on Mlt, a result given a
detailed proof in [H/M/P]. The corresponding statement on opetopic sets
and opetopes is asserted in [B/D], but the category of opetopes is not
described. In this paper, the category of multitopes plays a basic role.

Multitopic sets and multitopes are described in section 2 of this paper;
for a complete treatment, the paper [H/M/P] should be consulted.

The indebtedness of the present work to the work of Baez and Dolan goes
further than that of [H/M/P]. The second ingredient of the Baez/Dolan
definition, after "opetopic set", is the concept of "universal cell". The
Baez/Dolan definition of weak n-category achieves the remarkable feat of
specifying the composition structure by universal properties taking place
in an opetopic set. In particular, a (weak) opetopic (higher-dimensional)
category is an opetopic set with additional properties ( but with no
additional data), the main one of the additional properties being the
existence of sufficiently many universal cells. This is closely analogous
to the way concepts like "elementary topos" are specified by universal
properties: in our situation, "multitopic set" plays the "role of the
base" played by "category" in the definition of "elementary topos". In
[H/M/P], no universal cells are defined, although it was mentioned that
their definition could be supplied without much difficulty by imitating
[B/D]. In this paper, the "universal (composition) structure" is supplied
by using the concept of FOLDS-equivalence of [M2].

In [M2], the concepts of "FOLDS-signature" and "FOLDS-equivalence" are
introduced. A (FOLDS-) signature is a category with certain special
properties. For a signature L , an *L-structure* is a Set-valued functor
on L. To each signature L, a particular relation between two variable
L-structures, called L-equivalence, is defined. Two L-structures M, N, are
L-equivalent iff there is a so-called L-equivalence span M<---P--->N
between them; here, the arrows are ordinary natural trasnformations,
required to satisfy a certain property called "fiberwise surjectivity".

The slogan of the work [M2], [M3] on FOLDS is that *all meaningful
properties of L-structures are invariant under L-equivalence*. As with all
slogans, it is both a normative statement ("you should not look at
properties of L-structures that are not invariant under L-equivalence"),
and a statement of fact, namely that the "interesting" properties of
L-structures are in fact invariant under L-equivalence. (For some slogans,
the "statement of fact" may be false.) The usual concepts of "equivalence"
in category theory, including the higher dimensional ones such as
"biequivalence", are special cases of L-equivalence, upon suitable, and
natural, choices of the signature L; [M3] works out several examples of
this. Thus, in these cases, the slogan above becomes a tenet widely held
true by category theorists. I claim its validity in the generality stated
above.

The main effort in [M3] goes into specifying a language, First Order Logic
with Dependent Sorts, and showing that the first order properties
invariant under L-equivalence are precisely the ones that can be defined
in FOLDS. In this paper, the language of FOLDS plays no role. The concepts
of "FOLDS-signature" and "FOLDS-equivalence" are fully described in
section 1 of this paper. 

The definition of *multitopic omega-category* goes, in outline, as
follows. For an arbitrary multitope SIGMA of dimension >=2, for a
multitopic set S, for a pasting diagram ALPHA in S of shape the domain of
SIGMA and a cell a in S of the shape the codomain of SIGMA, such that a
and ALPHA are parallel, we define what it means to say that a is a
*composite* of ALPHA. First, we define an auxiliary FOLDS signature
L<SIGMA> extending Mlt, the signature of multitopic sets. Next, we define
structures S<a> and S<ALPHA>, both of the signature L<SIGMA>, the first
constructed from the data S and a , the second from S and ALPHA, both
structures extending S itself. We say that a is a composite of ALPHA if
there is a FOLDS-equivalence-span E between S<a> and S<ALPHA> that
restricts to the identity equivalence-span from S to S . Below, I'll refer
to  E as an *equipment* for  a  being a composite of ALPHA. A multitopic
set is a *mulitopic omega-category* iff every pasting diagram  ALPHA in it
has at least one composite.

The analog of the universal arrows in the Baez/Dolan style definition is
as follows. A *universal arrow* is defined to be an arrow of the form
b:ALPHA-----> a where  a  is a composite of ALPHA via an equipment E that
relates b with the identity arrow on  a : in turn, the identity arrow on
a  is any composite of the empty pasting diagram of dimension  dim(a)+1
based on  a . Note that the main definition does *not* go through first
defining "universal arrow". 

A new feature in the present treatment is that it aims directly at weak
*omega*-categories; the finite dimensional ones are obtained as truncated
versions of the full concept. The treatment in [B/D] concerns finite
dimensional weak categories. It is important to emphasize that a
multitopic omega category is still just a multitopic set with additional
properties, but with no extra data.

The definition of "multitopic omega-category" is given is section 5; it
uses sections 1, 2 and 4, but not section 3.

The second main thing done in this paper is the definition of MltOmegaCat.
This is a particular large multitopic set. Its definition is completed
only by the end of the paper. The 0-cells of MltOmegaCat are the samll
multitopic omega-categories, defined in section 5. Its 1-cells, which we
call 1-transfors (thereby borrowing, and altering the meaning of, a term
used by Sjoerd Crans [Cr]) are what stand for "morphisms", or "functors",
of multitopic omega-categories. For instance, in the 2-dimensional case,
multitopic 2-categories correspond to ordinary bicategories by a certain
process of "cleavage", and the 1-transfors correspond to homomorphisms of
bicategories [Be]. There are n-dimensional transfors for each n in N . For
each multitope (that is, "shape" of a higher dimensional cell) PI, we
have the *PI-transfors*, the cells of shape PI in MltOmegaCat.

For each fixed multitope PI, a PI-transfor is a *PI-colored multitopic
set* with additional properties. "PI-colored multitopic sets" are defined
in section 3; when PI is the unique zero-dimensional multitope, PI-colored
multitopic sets are the same as ordinary multitopic sets. Thus, the
definition of a transfor of an arbitrary dimension and shape is a
generalization of that of "multitopic omega-category"; the additional
properties are also similar, they being defined by FOLDS-based universal
properties. There is one new element though. For dim(PI)>=2 , the concept
of PI-transfor involves a universal property which is an
omega-dimensional, FOLDS-style generalization of the concept of right
Kan-extension (right lifting in the terminology used by Ross Street).
This is a "right-adjoint" type universal property, in contrast to the
"left-adjoint" type involved in the concept of composite (which is a
generalization of the usual tensor product in modules). 

The main theorem, stated but not proved here, is that  MltOmegaCat is a
multitopic omega-category. 

The material in this paper has been applied to give formulations of
omega-dimensional versions of various concepts of homotopy theory;
details will appear elesewhere.

I thank Victor Harnik and Marek Zawadowski for many stimulating
discussions and helpful suggestions. I thank the members of the Montreal
Category Seminar for their interest in the subject of this paper, which
made the exposition of the material at a time when it was still in an
unfinished state a very enjoyable and useful process for me.

Simplicial toposes and combinatorial homotopy,
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 400 (1999).


Abstract. The term *combinatorial topos* denotes here a topos of presheaves
over a small subcategory of the category of finite sets. The main instances
we want to consider are the presheaf categories of simplicial sets, cubical
sets, and globular sets, together with their symmetric versions: e.g., the
topos  !Smp  of symmetric simplicial sets consists of all presheaves on the
category  !Delta  of finite, positive cardinals.

     We show here how combinatorial homotopy, developed in previous works
for simplicial complexes (the cartesian closed subcategory of *simple*
presheaves in  !Smp)  can be extended to the topos  !Smp.  As a crucial
advantage, the (extended) fundamental groupoid  Pi_1: !Smp --> Gpd  is left
adjoint to a natural functor  M_1: Gpd --> !Smp,  the symmetric nerve of a
groupoid, and therefore - as a strong van Kampen property - preserves all
colimits.

     Analogously, a notion of (non-reversible) *directed* homotopy can be
developed in  Smp,  with applications to image analysis similar to the ones
of the symmetric case. We have now a homotopy n-category functor  C_n: Smp
--> n-Cat,  left adjoint to a nerve  N_n = n-Cat(C_n(Delta[n]), -).  It
would be interesting to determine whether the n-category  C_n(Delta[n])
coincides with Street's oriental  O_n,  and the previous nerve with
Street's, as it seems likely.

Subject: categories: paper announcement

Dear members of the mailing list, I'm pleased to annouce that the paper

        ``Rewriting on Cyclic Structures'',

by myself and Andrea Corradini, is available at
http://www.di.unipi.it/~gadducci/papers/RAIRO.ps.
The abstract follows, but shortly, it uses traced monoidal 2-categories
--where, in addition, each object ha`s a comonoidal structure-- in order
to simulate various kinds of (eventually cyclic) term (graph) rewriting.

Its interest for a broader audience may lie, besides in showing a
practical application of the trace structure in the rewriting field, in
its appendix, where we tried to sketch a very SHORT history of the
notion of feedback in theoretical computer science, with a particular
attention to the algebraic specification field. We found it interesting
to review previous approaches to the topic, after the results of
Joyal-Street-Verity have newly sparkled the interest in the algebraic
description of fixed points (see e.g. the recent paper by Selinger
advertised a few weeks ago on this mailing list).

Best regards,

Fabio Gadducci

\begin{abstract}
We present a categorical formulation of the rewriting of possibly cyclic
term graphs, based on a variation of algebraic 2-theories. We show that
this presentation is equivalent to the well-accepted operational
definition proposed by Barendregt et alii---but for the case of
``circular redexes'', for which we propose (and justify formally) a
different treatment. The categorical framework allows us to model in a
concise way
also automatic garbage collection and rules for sharing/unsharing and
folding/unfolding of structures, and to relate term graph rewriting to
other rewriting formalisms.

The preprint
Algebra of Principal Fibre Bundles, and Connections
is available at
ftp://ftp.imf.au.dk/pub/kock/princ4.ps
(102 kb).

The classical relationship between the curvature of a connection,
and the coboundary of its connection form, here comes about from a
pure groupoid calculation.

The preprint updates and expands my 1983/1986 paper,
"Combinatorial notions relating to principal fibre bundles".

Subject: categories: function spaces

Dear Comprox and Categories members,

Here is a short note that Reinhold Heckmann and I have written. Your
comments are welcome, as always.

                     On function spaces in topology
                     ------------------------------

    It is the purpose of this expository note to provide a
    self-contained, elementary and brief development of the fact that
    the exponentiable topological spaces are precisely the
    core-compact spaces. The only prerequisite is a basic knowledge of
    topology (continuous functions, product topology and compactness).
    We hope that teachers and students of topology will find this
    useful. As far as we know, there is no such development available
    in the literature.  Although there are one or two embellishments,
    our methods are certainly not original.  We briefly discuss more
    advanced treatments in the introduction.

             Presheaf Models for CCS-like Languages

Abstract
=========

The aim of this paper is to harness the mathematical machinery around 
presheaves for the purposes of process calculi. Joyal, Nielsen and Winskel 
proposed a general definition of bisimulation from open maps. Here we show 
that open-map bisimulations within a range of presheaf models are congruences 
for a general process language, in which CCS and related languages are easily 
encoded. The results are then transferred to traditional models for processes. 
By first establishing the congruence results for presheaf models, abstract, 
general proofs of congruence properties can be provided and the awkwardness 
caused through traditional models not always possessing the cartesian 
liftings, used in the break-down of process operations, are side-stepped. The 
abstract results are applied to show that hereditary history-preserving 
bisimulation is a congruence for CCS-like languages to which is added a 
refinement operator on event structures as proposed by van Glabbeek and Goltz.

Subject: categories: coherence => universality (preprint)

The preprint "From coherent structures to universal properties"
is available from

under coh-univ.ps

Abstract: Given a 2-category K admitting a calculus of bimodules, and a
2-monad T on it compatible with such calculus, we construct a 2-category
L with a 2-monad S on it such that: i) S has the adjoint-pseudo-algebra
property. 

ii) The 2-categories of pseudo-algebras of S and T are equivalent.

     Thus, coherent structures (pseudo-T-algebras) are transformed into
universally characterised ones (adjoint-pseudo-S-algebras). The
2-category L consists of lax algebras for the pseudo-monad induced by T
on the bicategory of bimodules of K. We give an intrinsic
characterisation of pseudo-S-algebras in terms of {\em
representability\/}. Two major consequences of the above transformation
are the classifications of lax and strong morphisms, with the attendant
coherence result for pseudo-algebras. We apply the theory in the context
of internal categories and examine monoidal and monoidal globular
categories (including their {\em monoid classifiers\/}) as well as
pseudo-functors into Cat.

It turns out, as Fred Linton kindly let me know just after I posted
this, that Eilenberg developed such an account to general function
spaces in topology.  Yesterday I got a copy of Eilenberg's manuscript
(in the literal sense of manuscript) that Fred Linton sent me, which I
read with pleasure. Apparently this will be eventually published. It
was written around 1985. So, after all, there is (going to be) such a
development available in the literature.

The methods that both papers use are the same, and are due to Fox,
Arens, Dugundji, Day and Kelly, Scott, and Isbell (although we combine
them in different ways). These references and most of these methods
are discussed in a paper on function spaces published by Isbell in
1985.
