While I'm comfortable with coalgebraic presentations of the continuum, as
well as such algebraic presentations as the field P/I (P being a ring of
certain polynomials, I the ideal of P generated by 1-2x) that I mentioned
a week or so ago, I'm afraid I'm no judge of constructive approaches to
formulating Dedekind cuts.  Would a toposopher (or a constructivist of
any other stripe) view the following variants as all more or less equally
constructive, for example?

1.  Define a (closed) interval in the reals as a disjoint pair (L,R)
consisting of an order ideal L and an order filter R, both in the rationals
standardly ordered, both lacking endpoints.  Order intervals by pairwise
inclusion: (L,R) <= (L',R') when L is a subset of L' and R is a subset of R'.
Define the reals to be the maximal elements in this order.  Define an
irrational to be a real for which (L,R) partitions Q.

2.  Ditto but with the reals defined instead to be intervals for which
Q - (L U R) is a finite set.  ("Finite set" rather than just "finite" to
avoid the other meaning of "finite interval."  The order plays no role
in this definition, maximality of reals in the order being instead a
theorem.)

3.  As for 2 but with "finite" replaced by "cardinality at most 1".
The predicate "rational" is identified with the cardinality of Q - (L U R).

Hello,

    I just started reading "Vicious Circles", which is discussion of
non-wellfounded or hypersets. It seems like this book could be rewritten
from a category theoretic viewpoint at the very least and perhaps even a
topos viewpoint. I say topos because I have an intuition that a category
with non-wellfounded sets as objects and total functions as morphims is a
topos. I am just scratching the surface of this book so it is just an
intuition. Or perhaps morphisms should be some other kind of function that
preserves structure. Any guidance?

Regards, Bill Halchin

No constructivist (of whatever stripe) would be happy talking about
Q - (L U R), as in your second and third definitions, since he wouldn't
want to assume that L and R were complemented as subsets of Q.
Your first definition, if I understand it correctly, is equivalent to
what most toposophers would call the MacNeille reals -- that is, the
(Dedekind-MacNeille) order-completion of Q. If you "positivize" the
second and third (which would appear to be equivalent, for any sensible
notion of finiteness) by saying "Whenever p and q are rationals with
p < q, then either p \in L or q \in R", you get the Dedekind reals,
which are a proper subset of the MacNeille reals (though they
coincide iff De Morgan's law holds) but have rather better algebraic
properties.

I don't remember the original context, so I don't know who's right,
but the answer depends on what sort of real number e could be.
It can't be 0, for example, so what can it be?

* If e > 0, then work with 1/e and use the Archimedean property;
  Bishop would recognise and accept this proof.
* But if you only know that e <= 0 is false,
  then you need Markov's principle to deduce e > 0.

I'd like to know the answer to this too. Why does *everyone*, in writing
down the definition of a PCA, include the assumption that Sxy is always
defined? As far as I can see, the only answer is "because everyone else
does so"; the condition is never used in the construction of
realizability toposes, or in establishing any of their properties.
In every case where you need to know that a particular term Sab is
defined, it's easy to find a particular c such that Sabc is provably
defined.

The somewhat mysterious definition of (partial or full)
combinatory algebras is really motivated by the fact that it
is equivalent to a "combinatory completeness" property, which is
a bit less mysterious but more cumbersome to state. Informally,
combinatory completeness says that all functions definable in the
language of A are themselves representable by elements of A.
More precisely:

  A is a PCA iff for every formal expression e (built up from
  variables x,y_1,...,y_n and constants from A via juxtaposition),
  there is a formal expression called (\lambda x.e), whose variables
  are just y_1,...,y_n, such that
    (\lambda x.e)[b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n] is defined for all b_1,...,b_n \in A,
    (\lambda x.e) a [b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n] ~ e[a/x,b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n]

(This is easiest to understand in the case n=0.) A similar statement holds
for full combinatory algebras where everything is always defined.

The term (\lambda x.e) can be constructed via the Curry translation from
lambda calculus to combinatory logic. The condition "Sxy is defined" is
needed for this to work. Also, I should say the whole theory of realizability
models goes through much more smoothly with this condition, otherwise one
has to keep making tiresome exemptions for the case of the object 0. I imagine
the condition becomes strictly necessary at some point, e.g. in the proof that
PER is an internal category.

As for Kxy ~ x, that's the same as saying Kxy=x, because all elements x of A
are of course defined.

Cheers, John

Dear Peter,

I think the relevance of this condition (Sxy defined) is explained in the
Hyland-Ong paper "Modified Realizability Toposes and Strong Normalization
Proofs" (TLCA, LNCS 664, 1993; reference 466 in the Elephant) where they
have a definition of "c-pca" which is just omitting this requirement.
They show that the standard P(A)-indexed preordered set, for a c-pca A,
can fail to be a tripos. So the condition IS used.

Another condition which is often imposed is really redundant: it is the
requirement that, if sxyz defined, then xz(yz) defined and equal to sxyz.
There are important constructions of realizability toposes where this
fails to hold.

I'd like to vehemently contradict the claim that the condition "sab is
always defined" is never used in the construction of realizability
toposes.

In the paper "Modified Realizability Toposes and Strong Normalization
Proofs (Extended Abstract)" by Martin Hyland and Luke Ong, a weaker notion
of combinatory algebra, called "conditionally partial combinatory algebra
c-pca)", in which the requirement in question is actually dropped, is
thoroughly examined. The axioms for a c-pca are that

	(K)	 kxy  = y
	(S)	sxyz ~= xz(yz)

where by "~=" I mean Kleene-equality (i.e. the r.h.s. is defined iff the
l.h.s. is defined in which case they are equal). It is not required for a
c-pca that "sxy" exists, but if z exists such that xz(yz) exists then sxyz
and hence sxy exists by the axiom (S).

The motivation for introducing the notion of a c-pca in the paper is that
there is a very relevant c-pca which is not a pca. It consists of strongly
normalizing lambda terms modulo closed beta equivalence and can be used
for providing a categorical point of view on the "candidates of
reducibility" method for strong normalization proof.

It is shown in the paper that the standard realizability tripos
construction will fail to actually deliver a tripos: The set of subsets of
the c-pca taken as the set of truth-values won't even model minimal logic,
which is why a "modified realizability topos" construction is used in the
paper. So there is a strong reason for stipulating the existence of sxy.

One relaxation of the notion of pca which won't break the usual
constructions but is nevertheless rarely employed (exception is e.g.
Longley's work) is the following: instead of sxyx ~= xz(yz) one might
merely require sxyz ~> xz(yz), i.e., sxyz is allowed to be more defined
than xz(yz). However, I don't know of any interesting models which do not
satisfy (S) with Kleene equality anyway.


Respectfully yours,

Peter Lietz

Here's another way to motivate the definition of PCAs, which
I believe also shows (in response to Peter Johnstone's message)
where the definedness condition is used in the standard
realizability construction.

Let A be any set with a partial binary operation (thought of
as "application"). Let PA be the powerset of A. The idea is that
we want to use PA as a little model for minimal implicational logic.
We think of sets X \in PA as "propositions", and elements
a \in X as "proofs" or "witnesses" for X. We think of the
empty set as "false" since it has no witnesses. We next
define an operation => on PA, corresponding to "implication",
as follows:
   X => Y  =  { a \in A | for all b \in X. ab defined and ab \in Y }
[Idea: a proof of X=>Y should map any proof of X to a proof of Y.]
The basic idea here is often attributed to Dana Scott.

Now, given any formula \phi built up from propositional variables
p_1,...,p_n using implication, and any valuation v assigning
elements of PA to these variables, we can interpret \phi in PA
to get an element [[\phi]]_v \in PA. Let us say \phi holds
in our model ( A |= \phi ) if there's some a \in A such that
for all valuations v we have a \in [[\phi]]_v. [In other words,
there's a uniform proof that all instances of \phi are true.]

We'd like this model to be sound for the (intuitionistic) logic
of pure implication. As is well known, the two axioms
	p -> q -> p
	(p -> q -> r) -> (p -> q) -> (p -> r)
and the modus ponens rule suffice for deriving all theorems of
this logic. Since modus ponens is clearly sound for the above
interpretation, we just need to assume we have "uniform proofs"
in A of the above two formulae.

Now suppose A contains elements k,s satisfying the axioms of a PCA.
Then it is simple to show that k,s respectively provide realizers
for the above two formulae, and hence A soundly models minimal
implicational logic. The condition "sxy defined" is important here,
as can be seen by interpreting p as \emptyset, and q and r as A.

The question of the converse is quite interesting. I have occasionally
suggested that the definition of PCA should be weakened to allow
sxyz >~ (xz)(yz), where >~ means "if the RHS is defined then so is
the LHS and they are equal". Some support for this proposal could perhaps
be drawn from the following result, which I had not noticed before:

  Let A be any partial applicative structure.
  Then (PA,=>) as above soundly models minimal implicational logic
   iff there exist k,s \in A satisfying
       kxy = x,  sxy defined,  sxyz >~ (xz)(yz)

(I do have examples of structures that are PCAs in this weaker sense
but not in the standard sense, but they are a little obscure.)

Anyhow, the "PA construction" above is an important part of the
tripos-theoretic construction of realizability models, so I think this
shows that "sxy defined" is needed even to ensure the realizability model
is a model for implicational logic. (My suggestion regarding internal
categories in my previous message was overkill!)

Incidentally, a few years ago, Hyland and Ong considered structures
called "conditionally partial combinatory algebras", where one assumes
sx defined but not sxy defined. They observed that the standard
realizability construction does not in general work for CPCAs, but
(in certain interesting cases) a modified realizability construction does.

Cheers, John

I hope Jaap and Peter will forgive me for saying that I think they
missed the point of my message. (Perhaps it's my fault -- with hindsight,
I wasn't as clear as I should have been. I really ought to stop trying
to reply to things like this late at night -- although, as you'll see
from the header of this message, I'm doing it again.)

Of course I know about the Hyland--Ong paper: indeed, I reviewed it for
Zentralblatt. However, the point I was trying to make was that the
construction of the quasitopos of A-valued assemblies, and the proof
that its effectivization is a topos, make no use whatever of the
condition that Sxy is always defined. The fact that the tautology
((p => (q => r)) => ((p => q) => (p => r))) fails (or may fail) to
be realized by S when p is empty has no effect on this construction,
because one never has to deal with "propositions" having an empty
set of realizers. So, whilst a tripos-theorist (if such a creature
exists) may indeed have cause to worry about whether Sxy might be
undefined, there seems to be no reason why a topos-theorist should do so.

[Yes, yes, I know that I was responsible for inventing the term
"tripos", and therefore that if anyone can legitimately be called a
tripos-theorist then I can. But I don't believe that I am a
tripos-theorist (which implies that no-one is).]

Dear Professor Johnstone,

I obviously assumed strongly that you know the Hyland-Ong paper and was
hence rather puzzled by what I mistakenly took for your question.

As to the question regarding A-valued assemblies when A is a c-pca, I
think I can give a justification for the axiom "Sab exists" as well.
I claim that if the axiom "Sab exists" is absent, then the resulting
category of A-valued assemblies is not a quasi-topos.

One can form the category of A-valued assemblies and it is regular and
cartesian closed.  However, the realizers for the evaluation maps and also
the construction of a realizer for the transpose of a map may exist, but
one has to make a case analysis as to whether the source object is
inhabited or not. Therefore it seems unlikely that the category is locally
cartesian closed, as these operations cannot be carried out in a uniform
manner. If this is the case then the category's exact completion is not a
topos. I am aware that this argument is pretty vague.

For a rigorous proof I would try to show that IF the subobjects of the
threefold product of Nabla(P(A)) do form a Heyting-algebra, which if I am
right is one of the requirements for a quasi-topos, THEN "Sab always
exists". I would go about it as follows.

1. Show that the exponent subobject of two subobjects of an object is - if
   it exists -  constructed as in the "unconditional" pca case.

2. Define the subobject m:S->Nabla(P(A)) with S = {M\subseteq A | M
   inhabited} and the set of realizers of M w.r.t. S being M (and m
   being the obvious map).

3. Interpret the S-tautology of intuitionistic propositional logic
   taking u,v and w as the pullbacks of m along the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
   projection of Nabla(P(A)) x Nabla(P(A)) x Nabla(P(A)),
   respectively.

4. Observe that it is the full subobject and use the reasoning of the
   Hyland-Ong paper to show that "Sab always exists".

Should I be wrong, this would also be good news in a way, because it would
imply that the standard construction of A-valued assemblies could be used
for semantic strong normalization proofs instead of the more complicated
construction of modified assemblies.

Best regards,

Peter Lietz

The recent discussion about real numbers in toposes has reminded
me of some questions I've previously wondered about concerning
choice principles in toposes.


As is well known, all that is needed to get the Cauchy reals
and Dedekind reals to coincide (and hence the Cauchy completeness
of the Cauchy reals) is N-N-choice (N being the natural numbers):

  (AC-NN)   (\forall n:N. \exists m:N. A(n,m)) \implies
                  \exists f:N->N. \forall n:N. A(n,f(n))

This is a very weak choice principle. Under classical logic
it is simply true (by the least number principle). Although
not provable intuitionistically, it is accepted
by the Bishop school of constructivism (in fact they accept
full dependent choice).


What I want to remark upon is that the coincidence of the Cauchy
and Dedekind reals also follows from the, apparently weaker,
principle of bounded choice:

  (AC-Nb)   (\forall n:N. \exists m \leq n. A(n,m)) \implies
                \exists f:N->N. \forall n:N. (f(n) \leq n) \and A(n,f(n))

from which one can derive, for any g:N->N

  (\forall n:N. \exists m \leq g(n). A(n,m)) \implies
           \exists f:N->N. \forall n:N. (f(n) \leq g(n)) \and A(n,f(n)).


Alongside this it is natural to consider a principle of boolean
choice:

  (AC-N2)   (\forall n:N. \exists m \leq 1. A(n,m)) \implies
                \exists f:N->N. \forall n:N. (f(n) \leq 1) \and A(n,f(n)).

(I am assuming 0 is a natural number). From (AC-N2) one can derive
for any k:N,

  (\forall n:N. \exists m \leq k. A(n,m)) \implies
           \exists f:N->N. \forall n:N. (f(n) \leq k) \and A(n,f(n)).


One obviously has implications

   (AC-NN)  ==>  (AC-Nb)  ==>  (AC-N2)

QUESTION 1  Can either of the above implications be reversed?

My conjecture is that they can't.


Regarding the relationship to the real numbers, as remarked above
we have:

   (AC-Nb)  ==>  R_C = R_D

where R_C and R_D are the Cauchy and Dedekind reals respectively.
In fact this implication cannot be reversed. More strongly:

   R_C = R_D  =/=>  (AC-N2)

QUESTION 2  Does (AC-N2) imply R_C = R_D?

Again, my conjecture is that it doesn't. Any counterexample here
would of course simultaneously show that (AC-N2) does not imply
(AC-Nb).


I'd be interested to hear if anyone has ideas on these questions, or
knows of references in which the above choice principles (other than
AC-NN) are discussed.

Thanks,

Alex Simpson

Hello,

     I understand (to some degree) full combinatory algebra, but I don't
understand the motivation behind the definition of a partial combinatory
algebra. E.g. why do we have Sxy converges/is defined? Or Kxy ~ x?

dyadic numbers are rationals in the form p/2^n. (google helps with such
things.)

the intuition that dyadic approximation has to do with markov's
principle is supported by the fact that markov's principle is equivalent
with the statement

>>that 1/2 + 1/4 +...+ 1/2^k > 1-e. in other words, that there is k

for a real number e, i am pretty sure that the above is equivalent with
markov's principle. it must be in books, but i think you can't miss the
proof if you try.

*however* you are right that in my "construction", it is used in a wrong
place, for a rational number, and k exists trivially.

splitting r is only the strongest sense of finding the canonical
representatives, not the only one. r may not split by a topos morphism,
but the canonical representatives can be found externally, and suffice
for a completeness proof.

after all, if i remember correctly, such is the situation with markov's
principle itself: for a decidable P,

* heyting arithmetic does not validate |- ~forall x. P(x) -> exists x.~ P(x)
* but if |-~foral x. P(x) can be derived, then |- exists x.~P(x) can be
derived.

in particular, if i can prove that not all numbers in a binary stream
are 0, then i can extract the first 1 from that proof, although that
proof transformation cannot be internalized as a recursive function, to
realize the implication.

all this is, of course, just more intuitive support for the idea that i
have been trying out, that *dyadic approximations might yield
representatives of cauchy sequences, and since they are a coalgebra,
help with their completeness*. i know that it is probably a wrong idea,
but it also feels wrong to me to settle with incomplete cauchy reals.
i'd like to understand why in the world would toposes deviate from
cantor's idea of continuum, so pervasive in everyday math?

Dear category theorists -
In one sense my movie book pays homage to the patient categoristes who
tolerated my limitations as a student of mathematics. I sure would like to
know if I am on to something with my category of abstract computers and
translators as a context for explaining virtual machinery. Below is the
formal announcement.
Ellis D. Cooper

report on research.

The audience for this FORM is the set of all Educators.

Philosophers, Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, and Engineers may value
the CONTENT. There is a set of stories and tutorials about Stephen
Wolfram's "new kind of science," allocating it a niche in a new structure

I'm looking for a better adjective than "eclectic" to use in the equation,
"Topological spaces are ?eclectic? frames."  "Lax" would be good but for
its extant 2-cell connotations.  "Relaxed", "mellow" (suggested at an FMCS
in Calgary some years ago for tensor products not required to have a right
adjoint in either argument), and "laid-back" come to mind.  (These tension
types were to my generation as snow types are rumored to be to Eskimos.)

If someone has already coined an adjective for this purpose, I'll go
with that.  Otherwise I'll take all recommendations and justifications
into consideration.

Context: Since comonoids in chu_2 are to biCPOs much as topological spaces
are to frames, I'd like to use the same adjective in the analogous equation
"Comonoids in chu_2 are ?eclectic? biCPOs."  (A biCPO is a CPO whose order
dual is also a CPO---does that have a better name btw?  The category chu_2
consists of the biextensional (left-separable and right-separable) dyadic
(over {0,1}) Chu spaces.)

Fran=E7ois Lamarche's casuistries, about which he spoke at the Barrfest, be=
ar
on this.  Any recent news on casuistries?  Fran=E7ois?  Anyone else working
on comonoids in chu_2?  That is, besides the team at theory-edge that has
spent the last 10 days attacking "Is every T1 comonoid in chu_2 discrete?"
for $500, raised to $1000 on Friday, see correspondence starting at

  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/theory-edge/messages/6957

The puzzle home itself is on Dominic Hughes' machine Thue as

  http://thue.stanford.edu/puzzle.html

I'll settle on the adjective on Feb. 26 (CMCS submission deadline).

JORDAN-HOLDER, MODULARITY AND DISTRIBUTIVITY IN NON-COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 474 (Feb 2003), 34 p.

Abstract. A study of lattices of subgroups or subrings adequate for
non-commutative homological algebra can be pursued in a setting of *weakly
exact* categories. These extend the Puppe-exact ones and the semiabelian
ones, and are essentially based on a notion of *gamma-category* introduced
by Burgin.
     In this context, subobjects form *w-modular w-lattices*, equipped with
a normality relation. The free w-modular w-lattice generated by two chains
with normality conditions is determined and proved to be *weakly
distributive*, by a construction inspired by the well-known Birkoff theorem
for free modular lattices. We show that this theorem is relevant for the
study of double filtrations, much in the same way as the Birkoff theorem in
the commutative case; similarly, it should be of use in the study of
spectral sequences.

The spaces closest to frames are sober, and the wayward ones are drunkard
frames. Though in practice one might euphemistically call them "relaxed" or
"mellow" out of kindness.

Scope:
------
The rule-based programming paradigm is characterized by the repeated,
localized transformation of a shared data object such as a term,
graph, proof, or constraint store. The transformations are described
by rules which separate the description of the sub-object to be
replaced (the pattern) from the calculation of the
replacement. Optionally, rules can have further conditions that
restrict their applicability. The transformations are controlled by
explicit or implicit strategies.

The basic concepts of rule-based programming appear throughout
computer science, from theoretical foundations to practical
implementations. Term rewriting is used in semantics in order to
describe the meaning of programming languages, as well as in the
implementation of program transformation systems. It is used
implicitly or explicitly to perform computations, e.g., in
Mathematica, OBJ, or ELAN, or to perform deductions, e.g., by using
inference rules to describe or implement a logic, theorem prover or
constraint solver. Extreme examples of rule-based programming include
the mail system in Unix which uses rules in order to rewrite mail
addresses to canonical forms, or the transition rules used in model
checkers.

Rule-based programming is currently experiencing a renewed period of
growth with the emergence of new concepts and systems that allow a
better understanding and better usability. On the theoretical side,
after the in-depth study of rewriting concepts during the eighties,
the nineties saw the emergence of the general concepts of rewriting
logic and of the rewriting calculus. On the practical side, new
languages such as ASM, ASF+SDF, BURG, Claire, ELAN, Maude, and
Stratego, new systems such as LRR and commercial products such as Ilog
Rules and Eclipse have shown that rules are a useful programming
tool.

The practical application of rule-based programming prompts research
into the algorithmic complexity and optimization of rule-based
programs as well as into the expressivity, semantics and
implementation of rules-based languages.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the
various communities working on rule-based programming to foster
fertilisation between theory and practice, as well as to favour the
growth of this programming paradigm.

We solicit original papers on all topics of rule-based programming,
including but not restricted to

    * Languages for rule-based programming
          o Expressivity
          o Semantics
          o Implementation techniques
    * Applications of rule-based programming
          o Analysis of rule-based programs
          o Programming methods
    * Environments for rule-based programming
          o (Partial) Evaluation
          o Abstract machines for rewriting
    * Combination of rule-based programming with other paradigms
    * System descriptions

FOUNDATIONAL METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers
in mathematics and computer science with a focus on the applications
of category theory in computer science.  It is a three day meeting,
which starts with a day of tutorials (Friday 30th May) aimed at
students and newcomers to category theory, followed by a days and a
half of research talks (Saturday, 1st June and Sunday, 2nd June).
There will be a series of invited presentations (TBA).  The remaining
research talks are solicited from the participants.

If you wish to give a talk please let us know by sending an abstract
and title to Robin Cockett or Richard Blute (see e-mail address below)
before the beginning of May.

Student participation at FMCS is particularly encouraged.  There
are limited funds to provide support for students who wish to attend
the workshop (see below).
__________________________________________________________

Support for graduate students:
__________________________________________________________

We particularly encourage graduate students to attend FMCS and to
present their work.  If you wish to give a presentation at FMCS
you should send a title and a brief abstract to Robin Cockett
(robin@cpsc.ucalgary.ca).  We would like to receive these abstracts
before beginning of May so that we can arrange the schedule before
the meeting itself.

Some limited funding is available to support graduate students who
wish to attend the summer school and/or FMCS.  To apply for this money,
you should contact Richard Blute (rblute@mathstat.uottawa.ca) and
include the following information:

1) A one-page email letter stating your background as well as why you
   are interested in attending.
2) The letter should also state whether you have access to any other
   funding to attend.
3) An email letter of reference from your supervisor or an appropriate
   other person.

Preference will be given to students who wish to attend FMCS and intend
to stay to attend the Fields Summer School.  Applications should be
made as soon as possible before the beginning of March.

Hello,

     I have some questions about the category whose objects are Heyting
algebras and whose arrows are Heyting algebra homomorphims.

 1)  Does this category possess a subobject classifier?

 2) Is this category a CCC?

 3) Is this category a topos?

 It would really be neat if 3) was true because of all kinds of
self-reference or infinite regression, e.g. it's Omega would be an
internal Heyting algebra, but my guess is "no" to all three.

Regards, Bill Halchin

As far as I can see, Peter Johnstone is essentially correct.
Even without the condition "sxy is defined", Asm(A) is locally cartesian
closed (though the correct construction of local exponentials is not quite
the "obvious" one), and its exact/regular completion is a topos. Peter
Lietz's argument (which is the one that occurred to me too) seems to fail
at his point 1: to get a realizer for the mediating morphism from the
true local exponential to the object he constructs, one actually needs
the condition "sxy is defined". For the record, in Peter L's example,
the true exponential m^m in the slice over Nabla(P(A)), for instance,
may be described as follows:
	   |T| = P(A)
   [|X \in T|] = {a | for all b \in X. akb \in X}
(where k plays the role of an arbitrary element which forces the "thunked"
operation X -> X to manifest itself.)

I think I can now appreciate Peter Johnstone's point of view, though it
seems to me that to follow it through consistently would require some
substantial changes to the way one develops the whole theory.
For instance, in defining the category Asm(A), one really ought to say
e.g. that an element r \in A *tracks* f : X -> Y iff

   for all x \in X, a \in A.  a \in [|x \in X|] => rka \in [|f(x) \in Y|]

so as not to get mired down in case splits on whether X is inhabited,
which (I humbly submit) are here an abomination and totally out of keeping
with the spirit of realizability and topos theory in general. [Classically,
of course, the above definition leads to exactly the same category as the
usual one.] One can then do everything else in the same way, and it all
works out - e.g. there is a perfectly respectable tripos over A (with Heyting
implication defined as in the object T above), and the theory of internal
categories such as PER also works fine.

I don't think one can really call this "standard realizability" any more,
in the sense of being derived from (a simple abstraction of) Kleene's
realizability interpretation. Of course, one might say that doesn't matter
much, but for my part, I feel one loses something of the directness of
standard realizability, where application in the PCA corresponds immediately
to function application in Asm(A) and also to Modus Ponens in the logic.
There is also of course the evident analogy with the Brouwer-Heyting-
Kolmogorov interpretation of intuitionistic logic. If one adopts the above
alternative, there is less of a clear intuition about what the significance
of application in the PCA is.

However, no sooner has one reached this point, than one notices that
doing realizability of the above kind over A is just tantamount to doing
standard realizability over the "derived PCA" a la Freyd [?], where
application is defined by a.b ~ akb. Indeed, one has the following easy
proposition:

   For any PCA A (where we don't assume "sxy defined"), there is an
   applicatively equivalent PCA B (in the sense of my thesis) in which
   sxy is always defined. In particular, the realizability topos on A
   (constructed as outlined above) is equivalent to the (usual) standard
   realizability topos on B.

   Proof: Let B have the same set as A, and define application in B by
   a.b ~ akb. It's easy to construct K,S \in B such that K.a.b = a,
   S.a.b.c ~ a.c.(b.c), and with a little additional care one can arrange
   that S.a.b is always defined. Now, application in B is realized in A
   by \lambda ab. akb (constructed as normal); and application in A is
   realized in B by i=skk, since i.a.b = ikakb = kakb = ab.
   The equivalence of toposes can now most easily be seen by noticing that
   the categories Asm(A), Asm(B) are equal on the nose.

So, it seems it's largely just a question of taste whether one adopts the
definedness condition. For my money, I would rather adopt this condition,
retain the directness of standard realizability and all the familiar
constructions, do all the proofs in an "effective" spirit, and know that
I'm not sacrificing any generality. Who could ask for anything more?

(Quite a lot of the above was new to me, and was all good fun!)

Finally, I'd like to remark briefly on the other issue in the definition
of PCA, which Jaap, Peter L and myself have now all mentioned: whether
one should require sxyz ~ xz(yz) or just sxyz >~ xz(yz). I know of no
reason not to adopt the latter, more general condition, and it seems
to me much more in the spirit of realizability: e.g. one never cares if
a realizer for a morphism assemblies is defined on more elements than
required. On the other hand, I do not have any particular use yet for
any of the extra examples admitted by this definition.

An interesting case in point is Kleene's second model, K_2. It is a PCA
in the sense of the axiom with ~, but the "natural" construction of an
element s gives one that only satisfies the axiom with >~. Some artificial
hackery is needed to produce an element s satisfying the stronger axiom -
and of course, my attitude would be: why bother?

The category of Heyting algebras has no hope of being cartesian closed
because its initial object (the free HA on one generator) is not
strict initial. It doesn't have a subobject classifier either, because
the theory of Heyting algebras doesn't have enough unary operations
to satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1.3 in my paper "Collapsed
Toposes and Cartesian Closed Varieties" (J. Algebra 129, 1990).

On the other hand, the terminal object in the category of Heyting
algebras is strict, which suggests that the dual of the category
might come rather closer to being a topos (although, by an observation
which I posted a couple of months ago, it can't have a subobject
classifier). Indeed, the dual of (finitely-presented Heyting
algebras) is remarkably well-behaved, as shown by Silvio Ghilardi
and Marek Zawadowski ("A Sheaf Representation and Duality for
Finitely Presented Heyting Algebras", J.Symbolic Logic 60, 1995):
they identified a particular topos in which it embeds (non-fully,
but conservatively) as a subcategory closed under finite limits,
images and universal quantification.

Unless my definition of Heyting algebra is a bit off, I am sure that this (and
hence 3) is false.  I assume that in a Heyting algebra T does not equal F.
This follows the intuitive introduction of Heyting algebras by
Moerdijk/MacLane as capturing the algebraic structure of topologies.

If that is not the case then disregard the rest of my message.

Anyway, under these assumptions, the trivial HA {T,F} is both initial and
final.  Hence 0 = 1 (= means is iso to).  Any CCC with 0 = 1 is trivial.  I
will leave the diagram chase to you but it can be summarized as follows.

Let A be any HA.  Then

	A = A^1 = A^0 = 1.

Hope this helps,

Bob McGrail

Normally I click the "No thanks, just place my order" button at Amazon when
asked whether I want to "Share the Love".  This feature lets you supply
a list of friends ahead of time whom you can email after your purchase
of a book with the happy news that you've secured them a 10% discount
on that book.  I ignore this feature because it casts you in the role of
Amazon salesperson and turns your friends into your clientele for as long
as they remain on your euphemistically named "Amazon Friends list."  At 10%
I find this role downright embarrassing.

Now if I could get my friends 100% discounts, or maybe even 50%, I'd have
to reconsider this.  I was just about to click the "No thanks" button on
my preorder of Peter's "Sketches of an Elephant" when it occurred to me
that a 10% discount on enough money to buy a house (ok a doll-house) was
the monetary equivalent of a 50% or even 100% discount on a lesser tome.

So this raises two questions.  First, are other sources of "Elephant" at
17% or better off Amazon's $295.00 price available to us eager students
of toposophy?  (See below for why 17%, $245.50 to be precise, and not 10%.)
And if not, is there anyone who'd been contemplating the purchase within
the next week (Amazon's time limit) who'd like to be on my list, even if
just temporarily for the sake of this one book, in order to be able to get
it for the amazingly low price of $245.50?  (Oh, that's the one I would
have chosen, sir, just sign right here, and here, and here.)

OUP presumably does the best off this deal, with Amazon next and me third if
I end up with at least two "friends."  (With only one "friend" the friend
relationship may as well have been symmetric since each side gets 10% off,
but that's still a 10% discount for each of two purchasers of the book.
The only advantage of no "friends" is you get to keep all your real friends,
but then no one gets a 10% discount that way.)

One thing about this system that I find truly evil is that if 2n purchasers
form n pairs in this way so that every purchaser winds up with a 10% discount
on the book in question, this seemingly fairest of all arrangements turns
out to be suboptimal for the purpose of extracting discounts from Amazon.
The optimum is to elect a single salesperson, who buys the book at no
discount, after which every purchase of that book within that week extracts
20% per book, half of which goes to the latest purchaser and the other half
to the elected salesperson.  With enough "friends" the salesperson who
took the original risk makes out like a bandit!

I propose to reverse this as follows.  I'll buy my copy at $295.00.  Anyone
wanting to be my "Amazon friend for a week" can then get it at $265.50.
To spare me the embarrassment of becoming a salesman I'll send you an Amazon
gift certificate for $20 which further gets your price down to $245.50.
I still clear $9.50 (if I haven't lost a decimal point somewhere like those
Anderson guys did), which means that if three people join this cockamamie
scheme (my gamble I guess) then I end up with close to the discount I'd
have gotten with only one friend, but my friends then become real friends
because I'm offering them $49.50 (16.7%) discounts on a book from Amazon.
Or two such if they buy two copies.

So, if anyone who was planning to postpone their doll-house purchase in
favour of buying two copies, or even just one copy, of Peter's book on huge
arches (ele arch, phant huge), please let me know and I'll add your name to
my list.  I will hold off on the actual purchase however until it is clear
that everyone who wants to be in on this in anything like a reasonable time
frame has joined, since the opportunity cost of splitting this arrangement
into multiple weeks is $59.00 per split (proof by induction, with the base
case being one purchaser, who gets no discount, whereas a second purchaser
brings the total discount to $59.00).

If you spot anything I've misinterpreted about Amazon's Share the Love scheme
in the above, *please* let me know soon before this hole is dug too deep.

Vaughan

Vaughan's message prompts me to pass on the information, received
today, that the U.S. end of OUP has already sold out of copies of
(at least) the second volume of the "Elephant", due to higher than
expected sales. The U.K. end still has some copies, but they are just
about to reprint, six months before they expected to do so. What
implication (if any) this has for the availability of the book from
Amazon, I have no idea.

John L. has recalled that the traditional definition of pca is motivated
by functional completeness.

He also has pointed out that in realizability one always may replace a realizer
by one which is defined for more arguments. Thus, it appears as natural to
weaken the notion of functional completeness to the following "asymmetric"
variant:

    for every formal expression e (built up from variables x,y_1,...,y_n and
    constants from A via juxtaposition),
    there is a formal expression called (\lambda x.e), whose variables
    are just y_1,...,y_n, such that for all  a, b_1,...,b_n in A

       (\lambda x.e) a [b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n] = e[a/x,b_1/y_1,...,b_n/y_n]

    whenever the right hand side is defined

Certainly, this assymmetric version of functional completeness ensures the
existence of a  k  (with the usual properties) and an  s  in A with the
property that

    (*)  sabc = ac(bc)  whenever ac(bc) is defined

Obviously, from a  k  and an  s  satisfying (*) one can prove the assymmetric
version of functional completeness. Axiom (*) doesn't even exclude
undefinedness of  sa  (if  a.x  undefined for all x in A).

Probably, such very weak pca's are also equivalent to an ordinary one?

In any case the notion of pca is somewhat intensional in character. As we
know Asm(A) and Asm(A') are equivalent iff their categories of modest
projectives are equivalent. Concretely, for a pca A the category MP(A) of
modest projectives is nothing but the category of subsets of A and maps
f : P -> Q such that for some r in A we have ra = f(a)  for all  a in P.
Of course, we know from John L.'s work that MP(A) and MP(A') are equivalent
iff A and A' are applicatively equivalent.

What, alas, is not known is an intrinsic categorical characterisation of those
categories equivalent to MP(A) for some pca A. If we had such a
characterisation we would have arrived at a categorical characterisation of
categories of assemblies and, this, also of realizability toposes.

Probably there are people that put this in the definition --
the same people that require 0 != 1 in any ring,
or that a topological space not be empty,
or (for that matter) that a CCC not be trivial.
But if you're not one of those people,
then the Heyting algebra {*} captures the algebraic structure of
the (unique topology on the) empty space.

So with my definition, {T,F} is initial but {*} is final.
But even with yours, I don't believe that {T,F} becomes final.
There are 2 homomorphisms to it from the power set of {T,F}
(as a Boolean algebra, which is a special kind of Heyting algebra).
I don't think that your category has a final object
(any more than the category of nontrivial rings does,
nor the category of nonempty spaces has an initial object).

Though my conclusion is consistent with Peter Johnstone's, I am now convinced
that my chain of proof is nonsense.

Of course, you should be paying attention to Peter's response, rather than
mine, anyway so shame on anyone who noticed :-)

Dear John,

would you please fill me in on either (or better yet, both) of the
following points, as I failed to figure them out by myself:

1.) Let A be a c-pca. If I understand correctly, you say that the indexed
    poset that maps a set I to the set of maps from I to P(A), endowed
    with the usual entailment relation [ for phi,psi: I -> P(A),
    phi |- psi iff there is an r in A such that for all i in I and
    for all a in phi(i), ra exists and ra is in psi(i) ]
    is indeed an indexed Heyting-Algebra and that the implication of
    phi,psi : I -> P(A) is given by

        (phi=>psi)(i) = {r in A | forall a in phi(i). rka in psi(i)}.

    My question is: given phi, psi and theta such that

        theta /\ phi |- psi over I

    via some realizer r, what would be a realizer witnessing

        theta |- phi => psi

    with => defined in the way you indicated?


2.) Given a c-pca A, you say that A equipped with the application
    function a.b := akb is a (proper) pca. What exactly would be a good
    S combinator for the new algebra ? (You wrote that some additional
    care is needed to construct S)


Many thanks in advance,

Peter



ps: in an attempt to give the shortest possible of the many reasons, why
    Heyting algebras do not form a CCC I suggest: The one-element poset
    is the terminal Heyting algebra. Therefore, every object has at most
    one global section. Hence, there can only be one morphism between each
    two Heyting algebras, as the global sections of the exponent correspond
    to the morphisms (which is absurd).

pps: The one-element poset *is* a Heyting-algebra, in fact all topologies
     are.

CALL FOR PAPERS 32 JAIIO - WAIT 2003
Argentinian Workshop on Theoretical Computer Science
Buenos Aires - Argentina
September 1-5, 2003

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Argentinian  Workshop on  Theoretical Computer Science  (WAIT) has
become an important Latin American forum for the exchange of ideas and
the presentation  of research in theoretical computer  science and its
applications.   The  workshop  aims  are  to build  a  bridge  between
academic and applied  research and to stimulate the  exchange of ideas
and experience between theory and practise in computer science.

The  meeting includes  contributed and  invited talks,  and tutorials.
Further, we are very pleased to  announce that there will be a special
issue of ENTCS (http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs) dedicated to WAIT
2003 publishing a selection of outstanding contributions.

WAIT 2003 (http://wait2003.famaf.unc.edu.ar), the 7-th workshop in the
series, will  be held in Buenos  Aires during September  1-5 (2003) as
part of the 32-nd Argentinian Conference on Informatics and Operations
Research (32 JAIIO, http://www.jaiio2003.uade.edu.ar).

Buenos  Aires  (http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/turismo/en/) is  a
cosmopolitan and  modern urban centre easily accessible  by plane from
most  mayor cities in  the world.   The city  is characterised  by the
multiplicity  of  its artistic  expressions,  ranging  from the  great
assortment  of sculptures and  monuments to  streets and  corners that
surprise with  their allegorical reliefs  and murals.  The  climate of
Buenos Aires ---oceanic  and warm--- is mild all  year round, allowing
visitors to discover the city on  foot in any season.  The city offers
all categories of  accommodation, and food ---which is  something of a
cult--- is of high quality.

TOPICS

Submissions are welcome in all fields of Theoretical Computer Science.
Specific topics of WAIT 2003 include (but are not limited to):

  * Logical and algebraic  foundations of computer science (logics for
    computation, category theory, relation algebras, type theory);

  * Formal methods (formal  specification of sequential and concurrent
    programs, analysis,  verification and transformation  of programs,
    model checking);

  * Algorithms and  data structures (sequential, parallel, distributed
    and on-line computing, probabilistic algorithms);

  * Automata theory and computational complexity;

  * Symbolic and algebraic computation;

  * Quantum Computing;

  * Bioinformatics.

Submissions  are expected  to contain  original research  and  will be

Further to Peter's remark that the opposite of the category finitely
presented Heyting algebras is rather nice ... one particular sense in
which it is nice is that it is a lextensive category!  So -- to
seemingly contradict Peter :-) -- it does have a partial map classifier
(but of course not for all monics)!

The fact that it is a lextensive category can be obtained, by checking
some Heyting algebra identities, from

"Conditional Control is not quite Categorical Control"
IV Higher Order Workshop, Banff 1990, Workshops in Computing
(Springer-Verlag) 190-217 (1991)

where the general question of when the opposite of an algebraic theory
is extensive is answered.

Any extensive category can be fully and faithfully embedded in a topos
so as to preserve sums and limits ... so the ability to embed the
opposite of Heyting algebra "nicely" into a topos can also be
read from these results.

-robin

P.S.Whether this embedding has the other logical properties
mentioned is, of course, another question ...

Hello,

     I am taking as my concrete topos the category of irreflexive graphs.
>From William Lawvere's book (and many other sources), I know what the
subobject classifier looks like, i.e. what graph is the subobject
classifier. I haven't worked out the internal Heyting algebra Omega yet,
but Hom[1, Omega] consists of three arrows, yes? (Sorry I know the
question is a little basic, but I need a sanity check).

Thanks and regards, Bill Halchin

                          AMiLP-3
 Third AMAST Workshop on Algebraic Methods in Language Processing

             Verona, Italy, 25-27 August 2003

              http://www.di.univr.it/amilp3
              http://www.sci.univr.it/amilp3

          First Announcement and Call for Papers


AIMS AND SCOPE. The Third AMAST Workshop on Algebraic Methods in
Language Processing, AMiLP-3, is aimed at collecting state-of-art
approaches and results in formal language theory, programming
language theory and natural language theory.
  Like its predecessors, held in 1995 at the University of Twente,
Enschede, the Netherlands, and in 2000 at the University of Iowa,
Iowa City, USA, the workshop is organized jointly within the Twente
Workshop in Language Processing (TWLT) series.

TOPICS. Research contributions are sought in all aforementioned
areas of language theory, as well as other areas of language theory
and language processing, including, but not limited to: formal
specification and analysis, relational and higher-order languages
and calculi, man-machine interaction languages, graphic and visual
languages, dialogue modeling, language translation, languages for
concurrent and mobile computing, new and emerging specification and
programming paradigms. A common feature of work relevant to the
workshop is the use of mathematical concepts, in particular the
use of an algebraic approach. Due to this, traditional boundaries
between the areas may disappear, allowing researchers to learn
from areas that were uncommon to them before.

SUBMISSIONS. Papers are sought describing original research work,
even if in progress or under tentative approaches. Initially we ask
you to submit a max. 4-page extended abstract. These contributions
will be evaluated by the Program Committee and selected on basis
of originality, significance, and relevance to the workshop aims.
Authors of accepted contributions will have the opportunity to
expand them to a max. 15-page full paper, for inclusion in the
proceedings of the workshop. Contributions are to be submitted
electronically, in PDF or printable PostScript format, either
through the workshop website or by e-mail (to either PC Chair or
to the PC Secretary, see below).

IMPORTANT DATES. Abstract submission: 14 March, 2003
                 Notification:        14 April, 2003
                 Full version:        11 July, 2003
                 Early registration:  25 July, 2003
                 AMiLP-3 workshop:    25-27 August, 2003

PROCEEDINGS. There will be a participants' proceedings volume in
the TWLT series published by the University of Twente, containing
the full papers, which will be made available at the workshop.
For previous volumes in the series see URL:
http://parlevink.cs.utwente.nl/Conferences/twltseries.html
If there will be enough contributions of sufficiently high quality,
a selection of the presented papers will be considered for
publication in a journal special issue, as it happened with the
previous editions of the workshop.

In my previous post under this subject line I asked two questions.

>First, are other sources of "Elephant" at 17% or better off Amazon's $295.00
>price available to us eager students of toposophy?

As it turns out, OUP is happy to offer 20% off this book for AMS, SIAM,
and LMS members.

As an AMS member I have suddenly forgotten what the second question was.

I hereby bequeath to nonmembers of the aforesaid societies my little theorem
about Amazon discounts, that for any bulk purchase accomplished within a
week, with Amazon handling both billing and distribution (separate shipping
addresses for each book), purchase of n+1 copies of the same book nets a
total discount of 20n% (n/5) for the n+1 purchasers, that is, n/(5*(n+1))
per purchaser.

Amazon distributes n/10 of this to the first purchaser and 1/10 to each of
the remaining n purchasers.

With Amazon's system, the first purchaser breaks even at the second purchase
(each purchaser nets 10%) and draws ahead with the third (the first purchaser
gets 20% and the other two 10%).

A group organizing for this purpose may prefer a completely equitable system,
in which each of the n+1 parties receives a discount of n/(5*(n+1)) (20%
of n/(n+1)).  Complete parity should therefore be achieved when the first
purchaser distributes n/(5*(n+1)) - 1/10 = (n-1)/(10*(n+1)) to each of the
other purchasers, but read Amazon's "Share the Love" rules in full before
ordering the first book.  Bear in mind that Amazon offers free shipping to
those not in a tearing hurry for knowledge.

A first purchaser with a taste for simplicity and a gambling spirit may wish
to offer a flat 1/6 discount to each of the other purchasers, keeping n/30 of
the remainder.  Breakeven in this scheme is at n=5 (a total of 6 purchasers).
I was close to that point when OUP's Alison Jones (Jonesal@oup.co.uk) answered
my first question in the affirmative, whom members of the aforementioned
societies should contact with their orders (if I have correctly interpreted
her emails to me on the subject, which seemed clear enough).

While all this may seem a bit hard on nonmembers of these societies, for
whom n could be advantageously larger if the members joined in this plan,
rest assured that the patiently supportive members of these worthy and
worthwhile academic societies do not feel your pain.

One other disadvantage of ordering from Amazon is that they appear to know
only about the 2-volume set of 1600 pages at $295, and not the higher-priced
individual volumes, for which one would expect Amazon to ask perhaps $170 each
were they to offer them.  If you aren't Superman planning to read and absorb
the whole 1600 pages in one speed-reading pass, and didn't need something
more substantial than the phone directory to stand on when rescuing the
cat off the top china shelf, you might wish to consider the ergonomic and
durability benefits of two separate volumes, the higher cost notwithstanding.

I do hope Peter J. does reasonably well off all this, heaven knows he's
worked hard enough and insightfully enough for it.

		 2 Research Fellow/Postdoc positions
		      in Logic and Computation,
			 University of Ottawa

The Logic Group in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
University of Ottawa is looking to hire two research fellows/postdocs
beginning in September, 2003.

The first position is part of a project on "Programming Languages for
Quantum Computing" led by P. Selinger. The ideal applicant will have a
background in programming language semantics, and an interest in
developing and applying semantic methods in a quantum computation
setting. Some experience in mathematical physics or related
mathematics is an asset.

The second position is in any area of category theory, categorical
logic, and theoretical computer science.

Both research fellows / postdocs will participate in the activities of
the Logic and Foundations of Computation Group. This group includes
faculty and students from several different Ottawa-area
universities. In the Math Department, the Logic Group currently
includes 3 faculty members (R. Blute, P. Scott, P. Selinger), 1
postdoc, and 6 graduate students. For more information about our team,
see http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/lfc/

The research fellowships/postdocs are initially for one year, with a
possible renewal for a second year.  The annual salary is $40,000.
Duties include research and the teaching of two one-semester
courses. Potential applicants should contact one of us:

 Philip Scott  (phil@site.uottawa.ca)
 Richard Blute  (rblute@mathstat.uottawa.ca)
 Peter Selinger  (selinger@mathstat.uottawa.ca)

immediately by email to indicate their interest. They should then also
send a curriculum vitae, a research plan, and arrange for three
confidential letters of recommendation, with one addressing teaching,
to be sent to Professor Mayer Alvo, Chairman, Department of
Mathematics and Statistics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON Canada,
K1N 6N5. Applicants are also encouraged to include up to three copies
of their most significant publications.

The official application deadline has already passed, but we are still
considering applications, and interested persons should contact us as
soon as possible. Those who have already applied for a position will
of course be considered and do not have to re-send an application.


P. Scott, R. Blute, and P. Selinger

Quoting Peter Lietz <lietz@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de>:

> 1.) Let A be a c-pca. If I understand correctly, you say that the

Not quite - you have to define the entailment relation to match the
definition of implication (put a k in there!). The cheating way to
see that all this must work out is of course via the equivalence to a
PCA for which the standard construction works!

> 2.) Given a c-pca A, you say that A equipped with the application

Note that we can find elements if,true,false \in A satisfying
	if true x y = x, 	if false x y = y,
and furthermore we can arrange that true = k.
(I'll use "if then else" syntax below).
We want to construct S such that (in A),
     Skxkykz ~ (xkz)k(ykz), and Skxky is always defined.
Take S to be
	\lambda txuyvz. if v then (xkz)k(ykz) else false
using the usual Curry translation of lambda terms. To see that
Skxky is always defined, note that, provably, Skxky(false)z = false.

Clearly there are two versions of this result, one with the axiom
sxyz ~ (xz)(yz) and one with sxyz >~ (xz)(yz). Thomas asks whether every
PCA with >~ is equivalent to one with ~ (Gordon Plotkin has also asked me
this natural question). At the moment, the best I can do is: for any
PCA A with >~, there's a PCA B with ~ and an applicative inclusion A -> B
(giving rise to a geometric inclusion of toposes).

Cheers, John

Hello,

      Given two graphs, A and B, I am trying figure out how to construct
the product AxB. I have been rereading "Conceptual Mathemtatics" by
Lawvere. The category of irreflexive graphs is one of the running examples
throughout the book. I have been concentrating on the chapters concerned
with the product of objects, but I don't see any details of how to
construct AxB. Have I skipped over something?

Regards, Bill Halchin

There is a point I don't understand. If I work out Skxky, then I find
a term which contains subterms of the form xk, yk. So how can this be
defined if x or y represent nowhere defined functions?

It looks to me, that you are using a form of Combinatorial Completeness
that is not valid with the weaker S-axiom. If I am correct, one has
the following form of Combinatorial Completeness:

For every term t and variable z, there is a term \lambda z.t with the
property:

If \lambda z.t is defined, then for each a, (\lambda z.t)a ~ t[a/z]

(of course, a really correct version has more than one variable)

Recently when rereading an old paper I came across a passage insinuating
that every finite limit preserving full and faithful functor between toposes
does also preserve exponentials.
I am sceptical because I don't see any obvious reason for it. It is certainly
wrong for ccc's (a counterexample is the inclusion of open sets of reals into
powersets of reals). On the other hand Yoneda functors and direct image parts
of injective geom morphs do preserve exponentials.
So I was thinking of inverse image parts of connected geom.morph.'s.
Of course, \Delta : Set -> Psh(C) for a connected C does preserve exponentials.
What about Delta : Set -> Sh(X) for X connected but not locally connected,
e.g. take for X Cantor space with a focal point added?

According to the e-mail I received from Ms. Jones (see below), this is
available only from the UK catalog. So those of us in the US may still
find it worthwhile to go through Amazon, or wait for the possibility
that similar discount may be offered in the US at some point in the

Hello,

1) In the very last chapter (Session 33 "2: Toposes and logic" of "Conceptual Mathematics"  where the authors cover topoi, they define  '=>' for the internal Heyting algebra of Omega:

"Another logical operation is 'implication', which is denoted '=>'. This is also a map Omega x Omega->Omega, defined as the classifying map of the subobject S 'hook' Omega x Omega determined by the all those <alpha, beta> in Omega x Omega such that alpha "subset of" beta."

Starting from "subobject S 'hook" ......" I got totally lost. I am frustrated because I know this is crucial to understanding why Omega is an internal Heyting algebra, so any help would be appreciated. (I am assuming that alpha and beta are subojects of Omega???).

2) In the same Session 33 on pg 350 is a set "rules of logic". These are exactly the axioms for a Heyting algebra, yes?

Although in the meantime I was completely convinced by John's argument, I
now believe that Jaap has indeed raised a serious point.


However, I think that the flaw (if it indeed was) in John's argument is
not in the form of combinatory completeness that he applies, but it is an
illegal instance of substitution, which one has to be very careful with
within a logic of partial terms where variables range over existing
objects (as e.g. in E+ logic, presented in Troelstra & van Dalen, Vol. I).

From

	IF FALSE x y  >~  y

one cannot conclude

	IF FALSE q r  >~  r

for q and r arbitrary terms.



As to the definitive and correct form of combinatory completess in a c-pca
I make the following proposition (which I have checked):

  Let A be a c-pca and t be a term built up using application from
  A-constants and variables. Then there is a term (\lambda x. t) that has
  the same free variables as t save x such that for all a\in A and all
  valuations of free variables

	(\lambda x. t) a  >~  t[a/x]

That means, if w.r.t. some valuation the right hand side denotes a value
then the left hand side denotes the same value. In particular, if for some
valuation and some a in A the right hand side exists (denotes a value)
then so does the left hand side and hence (\lambda x. t) (for this
particular valuation), as application is a strict function.

The same is true for simultaneous abstraction (replace x and a by \vec{x}
and \vec{a} resp.). One only needs to prove a little substitution lemma.

This proposition is essentially in the Hyland-Ong paper (the small
difference is that, in the paper all variables get abstracted away,
but that is inessential).



Best,

Peter

Dear Peter and John,

Peter correctly pointed out the error in my message:
the problem was in the use of the "if then .. else .." syntax,
not in any form of combinatorial completeness.

Answering John: I was using a construction of \lambda x.t where
\lambda x.M is KM whenever M is any term not containing x free
(this works just as well); so in my construction,
\lambda vz. if v then xkzk(ykz) else false
DOES contain subterms xk and yk.

Anyway, I do now believe that John's latest version is correct.
This is really very nice, and a surprise (for me, at least).
I stand corrected and must apologize for my first posting in this
discussion, casting doubt on PTJ's message.

One little point, regarding Combinatorial Completeness. I believe
the following form is valid (in the situation with the weak S-axiom):
suppose t is a term, x a variable. There is a term \lambda x.t such
that for all a,a_1,...,a_n in A:
((\lambda x.t)[a_1,...,a_n])a ~ t[a,a_1,...,a_n]
So this is just like the ordinary form, except for the assertion that
(\lambda x.t)[a_1,...,a_n] is always defined. We have that
(\lambda x.t)[a_1,...,a_n] is defined whenever for some a in A,
t[a,a_1,...,a_n] is defined.

Best, Jaap

If a full and faithful functor between ccc's has a left adjoint which
preserves binary products, then it preserves exponentials (Elephant,
A1.5.9(ii)). In the absence of a left adjoint, the result is not true
in general: Set --> Sh(X) for X connected but not locally connected
gives a counterexample, as you suggest, and so does the inclusion
(continuous G-sets) --> (arbitrary G-sets) for a topological group G.

    Probably it's easiest to try to define implication yourself, and then
you'll see that it is just what 'Conceptual Mathematics' says -- but if you
need more help:

    'Implication' is supposed to be a binary operation on Omega, i.e. a map
from OmegaxOmega to Omega. How can we go about specifying such a map?

    Well, a map from any object X to Omega amounts (by the universal
property) to a subobject of X, so we're looking for a subobject of
OmegaxOmega, i.e. a monomorphism with codomain X=OmegaxOmega. Now how can we
go about specifying a nonomorphism with a given codomain X? Perhaps the
simplest way is to specify two maps with domain X and common codomainY; then
the equalizer of these will do.

    See if you can think of two maps from OmegaxOmega to Omega whose
equalizer seems to capture the intuitive notion of 'implication'. It might
help to start with a simple case, the category of sets, where Omega is just
the two-element set with elements called T (true) and F (false). (If you
have ever seen 'truth tables', you will see that what you are looking for is
also called the 'truth table for implication', but if you haven't seen
these, please ignore this remark.) If you succeed in specifying the pair of
maps, you will have learned much more than you can by reading further; but
if after trying you are still stuck, then read on.

    The desired two maps from OmegaxOmega to Omega are:
(1) projection on the first factor, and
(2) conjunction, which was defined in the paragraph just preceding the one
you're stuck on.

    I hope you managed to find these maps, but even if you didn't, you can
now have fun by looking at the maps conjunction, imlication, negation, etc,
in irreflexive graphs (and other simple toposes) and comparing these with
those in sets; you'll learn why Boolean algebra, so familiar in sets, needs
to be replaced by Heyting algebra in more general toposes.

    Good luck in your studies!

Yours,
Steve Schanuel

I would expand this beyond Heyting algebras to quantales, residuated monoids,
etc.  See http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/seqconc.pdf for an example of a
situation, namely event structures as a model catering simultaneously to
concerns of branching time and "true" concurrency, that has traditionally
been handled in a Boolean way.  That paper extends event structures to three-
and four-valued logics of behavior.

This particular extension (expansion, augmentation) doesn't generalize the
two-valued Boolean logic of event structures to Heyting algebras.  There are
exactly two three-element idempotent commutative quantales.
Obviously the three-element Heyting algebra is one of them, and this HA
does find application in drawing a distinction between accidental and
causal temporal precedence, a topic Haim Gaifman looked into around 1988.

The other, which isn't a Heyting algebra, is at the core of the notion of
transition as the intermediate state between "ready" and "done," more on
this in the above-cited paper.

This is not to say that there is no topos-theoretic approach to this
extension.  In particular the above paper briefly mentions the presheaf
category Set^FinBip where FinBip is the category of finite bipointed sets,
as a notion of cubical set.  Cubical sets certainly provide one algebraically
attractive model of true concurrency that works roughly the same way as
the one based on this 3-element quantale---both of them entail cubical
structure---but I've been finding the latter a more elementary and natural
tool for working with cubes, at least for my purposes---homologists may
find limitations that I don't seem to run into.  An advantage of Set^FinBip
is that it accommodates cyclic structures (iterative concurrent automata),
whereas the one based on 3' as I've been calling this 3-element quantale
works with acyclic cubical sets, calling for iteration to be unfolded, much
as formal languages "are" unfolded grammars.

(Come to think of it, I don't know anything about the subobject classifier of
Set^FinBip.  If someone has a succinct description of it I'd be very grateful.)

The main point here is that there *is* a logic of behavior that is
close to but not quite intuitionistic, at least not in the strict Heyting
algebra sense.  Furthermore it is not a question of just finding the smallest
Heyting algebra in which the above quantale embeds, since there isn't one that
preserves the ordered monoid structure: a Heyting algebra must have its monoid
unit at the top, which 3' as "the other three-element quantale" doesn't.  So
whatever relationship obtains between the subobject classifier of Set^FinBip
and 3', it's not an ordered-monoid embedding of the latter in the former.

See http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/seqconc.pdf for more details.

I also for some time believed in John Longley's arguments that for any cpca
A one may define an equivalent one where application is redefined as

                ab = akb

but then I came across the following problem.

Evidently, all his arguments are based on "thunking", i.e. an operator T
such that
                Tt defined    and    Ttk  \simeq t            (1)

for all polynomials  t  and elements  a in the cpca. John suggest to take
for T  the combinator

               Txz  \simeq  zxk

which certainly is definable. HOWEVER, this T doesn't satisfy (1) in general
for closed terms t that aren't defined.
To see this failure look at the paradigmatic cpca of normal forms. The problem
there is that when applying the normal form  T = \x.\z.zx(\u.\v.u)  to
t = (\x.xx)(\x.xx) then  Tt  does NOT normalize as  t  does not normalize.

Actually, I even don't see how one can define composition in the cpca of
normal forms: consider the normal forms  a = \x.xx  and  b = \y.\x.xx  for
which we have that

                a(bu)  is undefined  for all u

BUT I don't know of any normal form t such that  tu  is undefined for all  u
(as such a t would have to be lambda abstraction \x.t'  with  x  not free in
t' and then  t'  cannot be a normal form!). Thus there cannot be a normal
form  c  with

                cu  \simeq  a(bu)  for all u

Admittedly, that looks a bit alarming because it might also affect the work
of Hyland and Ong. But on the other hand I don't see where I am wrong.
Moreover, in a sense the phenomenon is well known. When making normal forms
into a category one has to prove a cut-elimination theorem that certainly
fails for untyped terms.

Thomas

PS My impression is that people haven't really addressed Peter's question.
The reason for the definedness axioms of a pca are derived from the intuition
of "weak head normal forms" where \x.t is always defined (as like in
functional programming one isn't allowed to reduce under a lambda abstraction).
That is the "reason" why people have introduced the definedness axioms. There
is no reason why pca's should be the most general structure for which the
``realizability construction'' works.  As it seems to me normal forms are not
an instance of such a generalization (however it might look).

Dear Jaap, John and Thomas,

I am not yet convinced.

What I do more or less believe is that the operation of `thunking' works
for a c-pca.

But it does *not* seem to be the case that the combinator S that John
defined (using thunking) satisfies the equations

    Skxky(false)z = false   and   Skxkykz = (xkz)k(ykz) ,

even in a total combinatory algebra!

As I do not trust my term manipulation skills so much any more in this
context, I wrote a little Haskell Program to compute the normal forms.
The left hand side terms are indeed normalizing but their normal forms
are considerably longer than the respective right hand side terms. Oddly
enough, the normal form of the former term even contains variables.

Now it is very well possible that my program has a bug, programming is
hardly my main occupation. If you like to play with it you are invited to
access it via

	http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~lietz/cpca/cpca.hs

and if you find a bug please do let me know.

I cannot put my finger on exactly what is the gap in the proof. I think it
has to do with the fact that thunk(e,c) does not commute with substitution
in the way one might expect. Or put differently, the `thunk' algorithm and
the Curry algorithm don't play along very well. Something in that
direction.


Finally, I should apologize for taxing the categories mailing list
readers' patience with a subject that is likely only of marginal
interest to most.

have a nice weekend,

Peter

Hi,=0D
=0D
	The product in the category of directed irreflexive multigraphs =
is =0D
simple to compute. In fact, if you learn further about topos theory you =0D=

will learn that all finite limits in a presheaf topos are computed =0D

it is the category of all functors from the category=0D

                      ------------>=0D
=0D
to the category of sets.=0D
=0D
=0D
In simpler words, it means that if you take two graphs: G_1 and G_2 =0D
with vertices sets V_1 and  V_2 and arrows sets A_1 and A_2 =0D
respectively. The product graph P=3DG_1 x G_2 will have V_P=3DV_1xV_2 =0D=

(normal catesian product in sets) as vertices and A_P=3DA_1xA_2 as =0D
arrows. The incidence relation are the expected ones.=0D
=0D
For the reflexive directed multigraphs as all presheafs the recipe is =0D=

the same. I would suggest you to read the book:=0D

                              Workshop on

     CATEGORICAL METHODS FOR CONCURRENCY, INTERACTION, AND MOBILITY

                  Marseille, France, 6 September 2003


                       affiliated with CONCUR 2003

                    and held together with GETCO 2003


                            Call for Papers


See also:

   http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/events/cmcim03


Aims and Scope:

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers applying
category theory to concurrency, interaction, or mobility. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:

   categorical algebras of processes
   categorical methods in game semantics and geometry of interaction
   categorical models of term/graph rewriting or rewriting logic
   Chu spaces
   coalgebras, bialgebras, coinduction
   comparing models of concurrency
   enriched categories of processes
   interaction categories
   presheaf models


GETCO'03:

Due to the close relation between geometric and topological methods on
the one hand and categorical methods on the other hand, CMCIM'03 will
be held jointly with the workshop on Geometric and Toplogical Methods
in Concurrency Theory (GETCO'03). Both workshops will be on the same
day with their talks not overlapping.

Dear Categorists,

Some time ago, I have posed you a question about the characterization of
projective algebras in the category of all algebras of a given signature.
Since some of you appeard interested in the subject, I allow myself to
send you, in a slightly detailed manner, the answer that I have found.

Projective algebras coincide with free algebras in the following cases:

I. Any class (i.e. complete subcategory) of algebras that is closed to
taking subobjects and for which free algebras exist and have a certain
property (namely that there are no infinite chains of elements such that
each one is obtained by applying an operation to an n-uple that includes
the predecesor in the chain).

In particular,

II. Suppose X is a countably infinite set. Any quasivariety K of algebras
for which the kernel of the unique morphism extending X from the term
algebra to the algebra freely generated in K by X has finite congruence
classes.

In particular,

III. - The category of all algebras (of a given signature);

    - The category of [commutative] semigroups;

   - The category of [commutative] (non-unital and non-anihilating) semirings.

Best regards,

    Andrei

Here is some more information on the question of Andrei Popescu. In the
paper "Projectives are free for nilpotent algebraic theories" by T.
Pirashvili (pages 589-599 in: Algebraic $K$-theory and its applications.
Proceedings of the workshop and symposium, ICTP, Trieste, Italy, September
1-19, 1997. World Scientific, Singapore (1999)) it is shown that if
projectives are free in the category of internal abelian groups of a
sufficiently nice (e. g. Maltsev) variety, then the same holds for the
category of all nilpotent (in the sense of commutator calculus) algebras in
that variety. This is derived from the fact that one can lift splittings of
idempotents along a linear extension of algebraic theories.

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ALGEBRAIC AND TOPOLOGICAL METHODS IN NON-CLASSICAL LOGICS

Tbilisi, Georgia, 7 - 11 July 2003

The aim of this conference is to present some recent advances in the use of
algebraic, order-theoretic, and topological methods in non-classical logics.
We also hope to bring together researchers in the fields of non-classical
logics, lattice theory, universal algebra, category theory, and general
topology in order to foster collaboration and to get new ideas for further
research.

CONFERENCE TOPICS:

Lattices with operators
Topological semantics of modal logic
Topological and topos semantics of intuitionistic logic
Ordered topological spaces.

Hello,

    Here is an intuitionistic logic theorem prover that might be interesting in light of the relationship of Heyting algebras to topoi:

Adjoints for double categories
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 476 (2003), 40 p.

Abstract. After 'Limits in double categories' (Cahiers Topologie Geom.
Differentielle Categ. 40 (1999), 162-220), we pursue our study of the
general theory of weak double categories, addressing adjunctions and
monads. A general 'double adjunction', which appears often in concrete
constructions, has a *colax* double functor left adjoint to a *lax* one.
This cannot be viewed as an adjunction in some bicategory, because lax and
colax morphisms do not compose well and do not form one. However, such
adjunctions live within an interesting construct, the strict double
category of weak double categories, with horizontal and vertical arrows
provided by the lax and colax double functors, respectively, and a suitable
notion of double cell.
