Say Fcc is the category of all (small) finitely complete categories with
finite-limit-preserving functors as morphisms, and Int is the functor
which takes an object C of Fcc to the (finitely complete) category of
internal category objects* and internal functors in C, and takes an arrow
f : C -> D of Fcc to Int(f) defined by Int(f)(H, d_0, d_1, comp) := (f(h),
f(d_0), f(d_1), f(comp)).

Does Int have an obvious right adjoint, or does it at least preserve
colimits?

---Jason

* I honestly don't know what the most official definition of these are,
(and I can't get to a library for a couple weeks) but I had the one in
mind where an internal category is an object H of C, and arrows d_0,d_1 :
H -> H and comp : H \times_H H -> H satisfying the appropriate diagrams,
and internal functors are the obvious thing)

In the book

    M. E. Szabo, Algebra of Proofs, Studies in Logic and the
    Foundations of Mathematics, Vol. 88, North-Holland, 1978.

the author, according to a 1980 review by Carlo Cellucci published in
Mathematical Reviews (80b:03097),

    [...] studies the algebraic properties of the proof theory of
    intuitionistic first-order logic in a categorical setting. [...]
    Following the Introduction (Chapter I), there are twelve
    additional chapters, in which the author studies twelve theories
    of varied linguistic and deductive strength. The theories are
    divided into two main types: the monoidal type, in which theories
    based on the common algebraic properties of conjunction and
    disjunction are investigated, and the Cartesian type, in which
    conjunction and disjunction have their proper meanings. In every
    chapter the author follows the same scheme. He first constructs a
    category of a certain type as an algebraic model for the class of
    formal proofs being considered. Then he proves a completeness
    theorem to the effect that the arrows of the constructed category
    can be represented by formal proofs in a Gentzen-style sequent
    calculus with cut elimination. In the propositional cases the
    algorithmic character of the cut-elimination process is used to
    provide an effective description of the arrows of the category
    constructed and to develop decision procedures, in the form of
    Church-Rosser theorems, for the commutativity of the finite
    diagrams of these categories. In the last chapter, the author also
    shows how to accommodate quantifiers in the calculus of adjoints
    and describes the topos-theoretic setting required in order to
    develop the proof theory of intuitionistic first-order logic.

The book itself contains a wealth of technical detail that includes
many dozens of claims whose proofs are not worked out in detail.  I'm
writing to ask whether anyone has any knowledge about the degree to
which this work was refereed and/or whether the results have been
verified independently.  I'm appealing especially to those who work in
categorical logic or those interested in automatic proof verification
in category theory, both of which groups, it would seem, should be
interested in Szabo's work.

I don't know anything about the subject itself, but according to math. review
93a:03062 there's a paper by Barry Jay refuting one of Szabo's claims.  The
paper is `Coherence in category theory and the Church-Rosser property', 
Notre Dame J Formal Logic 33 (1992), no 1, 140-143.

The interested reader might also want to look at the recent paper by
Borisavljevic, Dosen and Petric ("On permuting cut with contraction")
in Math Struc in Comp Sci, Vol 10 (2000) (the Lambekfestschrift) which
corrects and amplifies another matter in the Szabo book.

15th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques
                                 joint with
             General Workshop of the CoFI WG & CASL Tutorial

                               Genova, Italy
                               1-3 April 2001
                     http://www.disi.unige.it/wadt2001/

Aims and Scope
==============
The  algebraic approach to system  specification and development, born
as a formal  method for  abstract  data types,  encompasses today  the
formal    design of integrated  hardware    and software systems,  new
specification   frameworks     and programming  paradigms    (such  as
object-oriented, logic and  higher-order functional programming) and a
wide  range of   application  areas (including  information   systems,
concurrent and distributed systems).

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

   -   algebraic specification
   -   other approaches to formal specification
   -   specification languages and methods
   -   term rewriting and proof systems
   -   specification development systems (concepts, tools, etc.)

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

The workshop will start with a full day tutorial on CoFI, the Common
Framework Initiative for algebraic specification and development of
software, see http://www.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI.  This tutorial will
also be available to people who do not wish to participate in the rest
of the workshop.  Besides the tutorial, there will be CoFI Task Group
meetings and presentation on related topics during the workshop.

Selected presentations will  appear after the workshop as a volume of
Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

The workshop will be a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences
on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS2001).
Special deals will be available for participants wishing to attend
WADT/CoFI 2001 together with other events of ETAPS.

SEE THE ETAPS EXCITING PROGRAM  AT http://www.disi.unige.it/etaps2001/.

Submissions
===========

The scientific programme of the workshop will include up to about 30
presentations of recent results and ongoing research.  The presentations
will be selected according to originality, significance, and general
interest, on the basis of submitted abstracts.  The selection committee
consists of the WADT Steering Committee together with the local organizers
(listed below).

The abstracts must be in pdf (or standard postscript) format, up to 2 pages
long in the style for publication in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html), and should be sent by
e-mail to wadt2001@disi.unige.it.

The deadline for submission of abstracts is

    10 January, 2001.

Abstracts that substantially depart from the required format, style or
length may be rejected without consideration.

The final versions of the selected abstracts (due by 26 February) will be
made available on the workshop web page, and included in a hand-out for the
workshop participants.

After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit full
papers for the refereed proceedings, which will be published
as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/).

Location
========
WADT/CoFI 2001 will be held in Genova.

              Foundations of Wide Area Network Programming
              ============================================
			(second announcement)
 
       13th International School for Computer Science Researchers
                    Lipari Island, July 1-14, 2001


The 13th School for Computer Science Researchers addresses Ph.D. students
and young researchers who want to get exposed to the forefront of research
activity in the field of Wide Area Network Programming, with particular
reference to the future of the World Wide Web and to issues of distributed
architectures, software engineering, object oriented design, security,
mobility, coordination, collaborative work and retrieval/handling of
semistructured data.

The school will be held in the beautiful surroundings of the island of
Lipari. Participants will be arranged in a comfortable hotel at very
special rates. The conference room (in the same hotel) is air conditioned
and equipped with all conference materials. Special areas are reserved to
students for the afternoon coursework and study. The island of Lipari can
be easily reached from Milazzo, Palermo, Naples, Messina and Reggio
Calabria by ferry or hydrofoil (50 minutes from Milazzo). The organization
provides a round-trip bus from Catania airport (the third most important
airport in Italy) to Milazzo hydrofoil terminal and viceversa. A
proficiency final exam at the end of each chosen course is mandatory for
students. A social tour to Stromboli with spectacular vulcano fireworks
will be held on Sunday, July 8.

The official language is English.

Courses

* Security Protocols and Formal Methods.

Martin Abadi
Bell Labs Research, Palo Alto
abadi@research.bell-labs.com
http://pa.bell-labs.com/~abadi/home.html

Summary
-------
These lectures are an introduction to security protocols and to some of the
formal approaches to their design and analysis. The lectures cover the
basics of security protocols, with some examples (fragments of SSL, SSH,
etc.) and principles. Then they focus on formal methods for modeling and
reasoning about security protocols, and particularly on the spi calculus
(an extension of the pi calculus with constructs for cryptography).


* Principles of Wide Area Programming.

Luca Cardelli
Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK
luca@microsoft.com
http://www.luca.demon.co.uk/

Summary
-------
We discuss the challenges of computation on wide-area networks, and
introduce a formalism, the Ambient Calculus, that matches some fundamental
characteristics of wide-area networks and systems. Our approach (developed
with Andrew Gordon) reflects the intuition that to function satisfactorily
on a wide-area network, the existing "sea of objects" must be partitioned
and made hierarchical, internally mobile, and secure.


* Coordination Languages and Models.

Paolo Ciancarini
Universita' degli Studi, Bologna
ciancarini@cs.unibo.it
http://www.cs.unibo.it/~cianca/

Summary
-------
The emergence of high bandwidth network technology, and the trend toward
reusing whole applications as components of larger software configurations
is fuelling the development of distributed software architectures and
agent-oriented programming. Coordination languages are a class of
programming languages which offer a variety of solutions to the problem of
managing the interaction among computing entities, like agents or
processes. These languages usually offer explicit support for composing and
controlling software architectures made of interacting active components.
Interestingly, most coordination languages are based on a few common
notions, such as pattern-based, associative communication, that complements
the name-oriented, data-based communication of traditional languages for
parallel programming. A number of interesting models have been proposed and
used to support coordination languages and systems. We will describe and
discuss a number of these models and languages.


* Mobility, Security and Proof-Carrying Code.

Peter Lee
Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh
Peter.Lee@cs.cmu.edu
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~petel/

Summary
-------
This course will provide an introduction to the security problems raised by
mobile code, along with an overview of approaches to solving them. A
portion of the overview will cover approaches used in current practice, but
the majority of the course will focus on various forms of proof-carrying
code (PCC), including the Necula/Lee approach as well as recent
developments such as typed assembly language. A substantial part of the
course will explain some of the "proof-engineering" issues that must be
solved in order to make any approach to PCC practical.


* Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming.

Doug Lea
State University of New York at Oswego
dl@cs.oswego.edu
http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/

Summary
-------
Topics include: Concurrent object models and their mappings to systems,
general design constraints and patterns for exclusion, state dependence,
sending messages, and creating threads, application-specific design
patterns for computationally-intensive, event-driven, and IO-intensive
programs, and for constructing distributed object system middleware.
Programming examples will be in Java.


* The Extensible Markup Language (XML).

Michael I. Schwartzbach
University of Aarhus
mis@brics.dk
http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mis/

Summary
-------
XML is emerging as a unifying notation for structured data. Its main areas
of application are Web contents and databases. In itself, XML is just a
particular notation for labeled ordered trees. The potentially vast impact
arises from a collection of generic tools that are being integrated into
the Web infrastructure. The main tools deal with namespaces, schemas
(grammars), linking, transformation, and querying. These lectures will
present 'the XML vision' and its technological foundations.


* Java, Jini and Related Technologies.

Jim Waldo
Sun Microsystems, Burlington, Mass.
and Harvard University
jim.waldo@sun.com

Summary
-------
In this course, we will investigate the effect being able to move objects
(including the code that implements the object) has in a distributed computing
system. We will begin by looking at Java Remote Method Invocation, the base
distributed computing infrastructure within Java. We will then see how Jini is
built on the semantic model established by RMI, and how such a system allows
abstraction from the communication protocols used in the system. Finally, we
will look at some of the research challenges open in such a world of mobile
objects.

             Final Call for Papers
                   MFPS XVII

         Seventeenth Conference on the
          Mathematical Foundations of
             Programming Semantics

              Aarhus University
               Aarhus, Denmark
            May 24 - May 27, 2001

Partially Supported by BRICS and the US Office of Naval Research

The Seventeenth Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of
Programming Semantics will take place on the campus of Aarhus
University in Aarhus, Denmark from May 24 to May 27, 2001. The MFPS
conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic and
computer science which are related to the semantics of programming
languages. The series particularly has stressed providing a forum
where both mathematicians and computer scientists can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. We also encourage
participation by researchers in neighboring areas, since we strive to
maintain breadth in the scope of the series.

The invited speakers for MFPS 17 include:
          Olivier Danvy  (Aarhus)
          Neil Jones  (DIKU)
          Kim Larsen  (Aalborg)
          Prakash Panangaden  (McGill)
          Jan Rutten  (CWI)
          Glynn Winskel  (Cambridge)

In addition to the invited talks, there will be three special sessions.  =
The first will honor Neil Jones for his contributions to theoretical =
computer science; it is being organized by Olivier Danvy and David =
Schmidt (Kansas State).

The second will be a special session on model-checking, and it is being =
organized by Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook) and Kim Larsen.=20

The final special session will be on security, and it is being organized =
by Catherine Meadows (NRL).

The remainder of the program will consist of papers selected from =
submissions we receive in response to this Call for Papers.

The Organizing Committee for MFPS consists of Stephen Brookes (CMU), =
Michael Main (Colorado), Austin Melton (Kent State University), Michael =
Mislove (Tulane) and David Schmidt (Kansas State).  The
Co-chairs for MFPS XVII are Olivier Danvy, Michael Mislove and David =
Schmidt.

The Program Committee Co-chairs for the meeting are Stephen Brookes and =
Michael Mislove. The Program Committee also includes:
   Lars Birkedal (ITU)
   Rance Cleaveland (Stony Brook)
   Marcelo Fiore (Sussex)
   Matthew Hennessy (Sussex)
   Alan Jeffrey (DePaul)
   Achim Jung (Birmingham)
   Gavin Lowe (Oxford)
   Catherine Meadows (NRL)
   Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary and Westfield)
   Susan Older (Syracuse)
   Dusko Pavlovic (Kestrel Institute)
   Uday Reddy (Birmingham)
   Giuseppe Rosolini (Genoa)
   Davide Sangiorgi (Inria - Sophia Antipolis)
   Andre Scedrov (Penn)
Submissions must be extended abstracts of 12 pages or less. They should =
be in the form either of a PostScript file that can print on any =
PostScript printer, or a pdf file. In particular, submissions
should use the US letter size format, as opposed to the European A4 =
size.

Submissions can be sent by email to mfps@math.tulane.edu=20

The Deadline for Submissions is January 15, 2001

Information about decisions will be available by February 20, 2001, at =
which time a list of accepted papers will be posted.

As with MFPS XI, MFPS XIII and MFPS XV, the Proceedings of the =
conference will be published as a volume of the Electronic Notes in =
Theoretical Computer Science. For information about this series, access =
the URL http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs.

General inquiries about MFPS XVII can be addressed to =
mfps@math.tulane.edu.

In addition to supporting the conference overall, the support provided =
by the Office of Naval Research makes funds available to help offset =
expenses of graduate students. Women and minorities also are
encouraged to inquire about possible support to attend the meeting.

               Registration Information
Detailed information about registration and accommodations will be =
available on February 20, 2001, when the list of papers accepted for the =

The following papers are available at my website:

[1] The relationship between the opetopic and multitopic approaches to
weak n-categories

[2] Equivalence between approaches to the theory of opetopes

These papers cover the work I presented at PSSL 73 in Braunschweig, and
CT2000 in Como.  The following paper covers the work I presented at PSSL
74 in Cambridge:

[3] Equivalence between the opetopic and classical approaches to
bicategories

This currently has hand-drawn diagrams and so is available only on paper;
I will be happy to send copies to anyone interested.

The website is 

http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~elgc2 

Summaries follow below.

Thank you,
Eugenia Cheng

The problem of defining a weak n-category has been approached in various
ways, but so far the relationship between these approaches has not been
fully understood.  The subject of the above papers is the approaches given
by Baez/Dolan, Hermida/Makkai/Power and Leinster ([BD, HMP, Lei]); we
exhibit a relationship between them.

In each case the definition has two components. First, the language for
describing k-cells is set up.  Then, a concept of universality is
introduced, to deal with composition and coherence.  Any comparison of
these approaches must therefore begin at the construction of k-cells.  
This, in the language of Baez/Dolan, is the theory of opetopes.  Hermida,
Makkai and Power use an analogous construction of 'multitopes'.  In [1] we
exhibit a relationship between the constructions of opetopes and
multitopes.  In [2] we exhibit a relationship between Baez/Dolan opetopes
and Leinster opetopes.

It must be pointed out that we do not use the opetopic definitions
precisely as given in [BD], but rather, we develop a generalisation along
lines which Baez and Dolan began but chose to abandon, for reasons unknown
to the present author.  Baez and Dolan work with operads having an
arbitrary *set* of types (objects), but at the beginning of the paper they
use operads having an arbitrary *category* of objects, before restricting
to the case where the category of objects is small and discrete.

In fact, the use of a *category* of objects is a crucial aspect of our
work.  The morphisms in this category keep account of the successive
layers of symmetry arising from the Baez/Dolan use of symmetric operads.
Abandoning this information destroys the relationship between the
approaches; by retaining it, a clear relationship can be seen.

In [3] we begin to examine the complete opetopic definition of weak
n-category, with the modifications necessitated by our previous work.  We
show how this modified definition is equivalent to the classical
definitions for n <= 2.

Bonjour, 

A new version of 
"About the globular homology of higher dimensional automata" 
is available at

http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~gaucher/sglob.ps.gz
http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~gaucher/sglob.pdf


Abstract : 

We introduce a new simplicial nerve of higher dimensional automata
whose simplicial homology groups shifted by one yield a new definition
of the globular homology.  With this new definition, the drawbacks
noticed with the construction of \cite{Gau} disappear. Moreover the
important morphisms which associate to every globe its corresponding
branching area and merging area of execution paths become morphisms of
simplicial sets.

Dear Colleagues,

This message is to let the categorical community know that I have decided to
resign from the Editorial Board of the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra.
I shall (eventually) deal with all papers submitted to me as editor before the
end of 2000 (some of which have been subject to quite shameful delays -- see
below), but I shall not handle any further papers. The following is an edited
version of my letter of resignation, sent to the Managing Editors.

"The primary reason for resigning is that it has become increasingly clear to
me that I simply can't hope to find time for the volume of editorial work that
comes my way, on top of my teaching and administrative commitments, and still
have any time at all for my own research. Indeed, for some months now I have
been unable to deal with editorial work at all, because the sheer volume of
things awaiting my attention sent me into a depressed state every time I tried
to tackle them.

"The problem was compounded by the pressures of moving to our new building
(after 24 years in the same office) in September, which meant that all my
files had to be packed up some weeks beforehand; some of the JPAA material
went missing in the move, and I still haven't got myself fully straightened
out. But that isn't the root cause of the problem; it had started before then.

"I think a more significant cause is the fact that I no longer believe in the
value of the job that I'm doing as an editor of JPAA: I am very uncertain
about the role of print journals, particularly commercial ones, in the 21st
century. Why people still want to submit their papers to JPAA, rather than to
an electronic journal such as "Theory and Applications of Categories" (of which
I am also, and plan to remain, an editor), is something I don't understand.
(And yes, I know that Elsevier will say that they are moving with the times in
making their journals available in electronic form, but in fact their pricing
policy for electronic access, which is such that even Cambridge University has
stopped subscribing, reveals them for the dinosaurs that they are -- they
deserve the extinction that will, in my view, soon come upon them. Indeed, I
could rationalize my decision to resign by saying that I was doing so in
protest at Elsevier's pricing policy for electronic access, and that wouldn't
be wholly untrue.)"

I apologize sincerely to all those people whose papers have been held up as a
result of my inaction in recent months; I am determined to sort out the mess
that I've created, if they will bear with me.

Peter Johnstone

			  First Announcement

			       ConCoord
	International Workshop on Concurrency and Coordination
	======================================================

			 Lipari Island, Italy
			    6-8 July 2001

           A workshop associated to the 13th Lipari School

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aims and Scope

 During the last few years, the role of global computing, and 
 in particular of web applications, has become more and more
 widespread. The emerging programming paradigms require on the 
 one hand mechanisms to support mobility of code and computations, 
 and effective infrastructures to support coordination and control 
 of dynamically loaded software modules. On the other hand, an
 abstract semantic framework to formalize the model of computation 
 of internet applications is clearly needed. Such a semantic framework
 may provide the formal basis to discuss and motivate controversial
 design/implementation issues and to state and certify properties in 
 a rigorous way.

 Similar aims have been pursued by two Esprit working groups, which
 recently terminated their activity: CONFER-2 (CONcurrency and Functions:  
 Evaluation and Reduction <http://para.inria.fr/confer/>) led by 
 Jean-Jacques Lévy (Inria Roquencourt), with technical assistance of Lone
 Leth and Bent Thomsen (ICL, London); and COORDINA (From COORDINAtion 
 models to applications, <http://malvasia.di.fct.unl.pt/activity/coordina/>),
 led by Antonio Porto (DI-FCT/UNL, Lisboa).

 The goal of the workshop is to review the large range of results
 achieved by the two working groups and to set the stage for future
 scientific advances and collaboration. However contributions and
 participation are encouraged by all those interested in the mentioned
 topics. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location

 The workshop is associated to the 13th Lipari School for Computer
 Science Researchers, Lipari, July 1-14, 2001. The Lipari School 
 (<http://lipari.dmi.unict.it/Lipari/index.asp>) is a well established
 initiative attended every year by about 60 PhD students and researchers 
 from Italy, Europe and the US. In 2001 the school will be dedicated to 
 the foundations of Wide Area Network Programming and will consist of 
 lectures by Martin Abadi, Bell Labs Research, Palo Alto; Luca Cardelli, 
 Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK; Paolo Ciancarini, University of
 Bologna; Peter Lee, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh; Doug Lea,
 State University of New York at Oswego; Michael I. Schwartzbach,
 University of Aarhus; and Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems, Burlington,
 Mass. and Harvard University.  

 Lipari is the largest island of the Eolie Archipelago, located north
 of Sicily, well known for its volcanic activities. It has sceneries
 of incomparable beauty and contrasting character. It can be easily
 reached from Milazzo, Palermo, Naples, Messina and Reggio Calabria by
 ferry or hydrofoil (50 minutes from Milazzo).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program

 The program of the workshop will include invited talks by the
 lecturers of the Lipari School (and possibly others), and talks
 presenting submitted contributions.

I'd like to ask category theorists how they would answer the attached message 
from a colleague here.  Both he and the person with whom he is corresponding 
are experts in the areas of knowledge representation within computer science 
(ontologies and the like).  I thought it best to hide their identities since 
I haven't asked permission to use them.  If you are interested, please respond 
to me privately if you would.

Thank you,
Mike Healy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Message I received:----

I would be delighted if there was no semantic conflict between
category theory and set theory.  I kind of flagged this as a
potential issue, but did not look  into it in detail, as it was
not my main concern at the time.  However, I remain unconvinced.
There has been some discussion of using set theory as the basis
for a semantics for SUOKIF. If this is true, then I think it may
be limiting to a CT based language. While it may be true that sets
are common example of a catagory, my sense is that CT is much more
powerful, and would be LIMITED if everything was forced into the
single catagory of sets.

Im a bit out of my element here, however, and need to defer to the
formal expertise of others on this issue.


Message to which the above was replying:---

I agree that category theory is very powerful and could be
an important basis for combining and sharing ontologies.
But I disagree with the following point:

>I think this idea has tremendous potential.  One problem is that the underlying

First-order logic (including any and all notations for it,
such as KIF, CGs, predicate calculus, existential graphs, etc.)
is completely neutral with respect to set theory or category
theory.  The version 3.0 of KIF did include a version of set
theory, but that was removed in the KIF'99 version because it
belongs to ontology rather than logic.

And for that matter, there is no reason why you can't use both
category theory and set theory together.  In fact, one of the
most common examples of a category is the category of sets.

Perhaps there may be incompatibilities between the methodology
associated with Ontolingua and category-based techiques, but
Ontolingua is not KIF.  Ontolingua simply uses KIF.

Hello Michael,

I believe that category theory is an excellent foundation for ontology 
representation and manipulation -- I use it myself.

However, choosing this foundation comes at a price.  Unless significant 
work is done to hide this unfamiliar foundation, many users (of the theory, 
the system, the language, &c) will be biased against the work from 
minute-one.  This has as much to do with the unfamiliarity of CT as it does 
with certain unfortunate negative biases regularly expressed by many 
mathematicians and computer scientists - biases that, IMHO, are founded in 
ignorance and not reason.

Many computer scientists, mathematician, and users of knowledge 
representation systems are quite familiar (at least in use, but probably 
not in foundations or related complications) and comfortable with set 
theory.  This familiarity is an incentive rather than an obstacle to using 
related work.

Personally, I chose not to pursue a set theoretical foundation because of 
theoretical and representational complexity issues (e.g. witness the use of 
a set theoretical foundation for the Z specification language) as well as 
the unfortunate binding to a particular formalism that isn't necessarily 
congruent with others that I work in and apply my work to (e.g. type theory 
and programming languages).  To rephrase, I find using CT to be more clear 
and tractable than set theory and I feel that my work can, as a result, say 
and do more than it could if it had a set theory (plus some extra 
formalisms) bases.

Note that I also chose not to build my work (solely) on type theory and 
order sorted algebras for the same reason, though my work has elements of 
both of those fields as well.

The comments about Ontolingua and KIF are on-target in my experience.  I 
see no obstructions to the representation of CKML (the variant related to 
KIF and RDF that I happen to know well) with my work.

Finally, I should point out that I am but an infant in CT - I'm much more 
comfortable with TT, OSA, PL, and others.  I've only been learning and 
using CT for a few months and, while there have been some objection to my 
choice, I feel that a dissertation founded in these three major fields (CT, 
TT, and OSA) has significantly broader application and, implicitly, more to 
say about its author. <grin>

Best,
Joe Kiniry

The following two research assistant positions
are available at the University of Bremen, Germany.

The Bremen Institute of Safe Systems in the Center for Computing 
Technologies at the University of Bremen hosts the research projects
 
"Multi-logic systems as a basis for heterogeneous specification 
and development" (MULTIPLE) 

and 

"Algebraic specification + functional programming = 
environment for formal software development" (HasCASL)

funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). 


Within the framework of each of these projects, one position in the 
working group of Prof. Dr. Krieg-Brückner is to be immediately 
filled for at least  two years (additional option for another two
years), 
subject to availability of funds: 

Research Assistant 
Verg. Gr. IIa BAT (full time) 

In addition to successful university studies in computer science, 
experience and skills in functional programming (e.g. Haskell, ML) 
are expected. Familiarity with at least one of formal specification 
methods (like  CoFI/CASL), theorem proving or category theory is
desirable. 

Applicants with a PhD are welcome. However, there will also be the 
oppurtunity to prepare a PhD thesis in connection with the research
project. 

In case of essentially equal qualification in the subject and personal 
suitability, severely handicapped applicants will be preferred. The 
University of Bremen intends to increase the share of women in 
scientific activities and does therefore strongly encourage women to 
apply for these positions. 

More detailed information about the projects can be found under
http://www.tzi.de/cofi/projects/multiple.html 
http://www.tzi.de/cofi/projects/hascasl.html 

Please address your application with the usual documents and the 
reference number A164/00 (MULTIPLE) resp. A165/00 (HasCASL)
before 01.02.2001 to:

The following preprint is available:

M. Grandis
"On the monad of proper factorisation systems in categories"  (8 pages).

Abstract. It is known that factorisation systems in categories can be
viewed as unitary pseudo algebras for the "squaring" monad P = (-)^2,  in
Cat.
   We show in this note that an analogous fact holds for proper (i.e.,
epi-mono) factorisation systems and a suitable quotient of the former
monad, deriving from a construct introduced by P. Freyd for stable
homotopy.
Some similarities of  P  with the structure of the path endofunctor of
topological spaces are considered.

		   CALL FOR TALKS AND PARTICIPATION

              Workshop on Structure Preserving Relations



Relations are ubiquitous in Computer Science.  In particular, those
which preserve structure are of central interest, appearing in the
form of logical relations and bisimulation, and used to study
abstraction and data and program refinement, for example.

The workshop is intended to bring researchers on these topics together
to present and compare their various approaches, and to allow
potential users of these techniques to see which if any of these
structures may be of use in their own more applied research.

The workshop will be held at ETL/AIST in Amagasaki, which is a scenic
coastal town near Kobe, with easy rail connections to the famous
tourist sites of Kyoto and Nara. The meeting will commence at 2:00 pm
on Monday, March 12, 2001, finishing sometime after lunch on

TALKS AND THE PROCEEDINGS:

      We wish to keep the informal atmosphere of the previous workshop
      making it easier to go for fruitful discussions.  All
      participants are welcome to give a talk on relations which
      preserve some mathematical structure such as algebraic
      structure.  We do not collect papers from the speakers in
      advance of the workshop.  Rather, we will bundle a
      post-proceedings of the workshop, which we plan to publish in a
      volume of Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.  To
      this post-proceedings, not only the speakers but all
      participants will be invited to submit papers about topics
      related to the workshop.

International Workshop on Reduction Strategies in Rewriting and
                     Programming (WRS 2001)

                      http://www.logic.at/wrs01/

                 held in conjunction with RTA 2001
               Utrecht, The Netherlands, May 26, 2001

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

BACKGROUND AND AIMS

Reduction strategies in rewriting and programming have attracted an
increasing attention within the last years. New types of reduction
strategies have been invented and investigated, and new results on
rewriting / computation under particular strategies have
been obtained. Research in this field ranges from primarily
theoretical
questions about reduction strategies to very practical application and

implementation issues. The need for a deeper understanding of
reduction
strategies in rewriting and programming, both in theory and practice,
is obvious, since they bridge the gap between unrestricted general
rewriting (computation) and (more deterministic) rewriting with
particular strategies (programming). Moreover, reduction strategies
provide a natural way to go from operational principles (e.g., graph
and term rewriting, narrowing, lambda-calculus) and semantics (e.g.,
normalization, computation of values, infinitary normalization,
head-normalization) to implementations of programming
languages.

Therefore any progress in this area is likely to be of interest not
only to the rewriting community, but also to neighbouring fields like
functional programming, functional-logic programming, and termination
proofs of algorithms.

The workshop wants to provide a forum for the presentation and
discussion of new ideas and results, recent developments, new research

directions, as well as of surveys on existing knowledge in this
area. Furthermore we aim at fostering interaction and exchange between

researchers and students actively working on such topics.
The workshop will be held in conjunction with RTA 2001 in Utrecht (The

Netherlands) on May 26, 2001. It will feature 2 invited talks, a panel

discussion, and contributed presentations selected from the
submissions, with ample time for discussion.

The workshop is (co-)organized by U Utrecht, TU Valencia and TU Wien.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to,
- theoretical foundations for the definition and semantic description
  of reduction strategies
- strategies in different frameworks (term rewriting, graph rewriting,

  infinitary rewriting, lambda calculi, higher order rewriting,
  conditional rewriting, rewriting with built-ins, narrowing,
  constraint solving, etc.) and their application in (equational,
  functional, functional-logic) programming (languages)
- properties of reduction strategies / computations under
  strategies (e.g., completeness, computability, decidability,
  complexity, optimality, (hyper-)normalization, cofinality,
  fairness, perpetuality, context-freeness, neededness, lazyness,
  eagerness, strictness)
- interrelations, combinations and applications of
  reduction under different strategies (e.g., equivalence
  conditions for fundamental properties like termination and
  confluence, applications in modularity analysis, connections
  between strategies of different frameworks, etc.)
- program analysis and other semantics-based optimization techniques
  dealing with reduction strategies
- rewrite systems / tools / implementations with flexible /
  programmable strategies as essential concept / ingredient
- specification of reduction strategies in (real) languages
- data structures and implementation techniques for reduction
  strategies.


SUBMISSIONS

We solicit papers on all aspects of reduction strategies in
rewriting and programming. Submissions should describe unpublished
work, except for survey papers which are explicitly welcome,
too. Submissions should not exceed 10 pages (however, survey papers
may be longer) and be sent in postscript format to the PC co-chairs
(wrs01@logic.at) by March 1, 2001. Selection of papers by the PC
will be based on originality, significance, and correctness.
Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings that will

be available at the workshop, and electronically on the web.
Depending on the number and quality of submissions, formal publication
of the proceedings is envisaged.

Researchers just interested in attending the workshop may send a
corresponding email to wrs01@logic.at by March 1, 2001, preferably
together with a brief position paper (up to two pages in postscript)
describing their interest and/or work in the area. However, we will
also consider late requests for attendance.

"Lax factorization algebras"

Jiri Rosicky' and Walter Tholen

Abstract: It is shown that many weak factorization systems appearing in
functorial Quillen model categories, including all those that are
cofibrantly generated, come with a rich computational structure, defined
by a certain lax algebra with respect to the "squaring monad" on CAT. This
structure largely facilitates natural choices for left or right liftings
once certain basic natural choices have been made. The use of lax
homomorphisms of such lax algebras is also discussed, with focus on "lax
freeness".

it's interesting that almost no one took michael healy's bait (attached).
a couple of years ago, a similar question started a long battle between a
group of categorists from this list, and a group of set theorists on
another list. traces of that battle can still be found scattered on the
web.

i guess people got a bit tired. after all, for a working mathematician,
foundations are a bit like esperanto: ok, all math can be translated to
set theory, or to category theory, or to untyped lambda calculus --- so
what? do foundations help me calculate an integral? does anyone use von
neumann representation of numbers in arithmetic? no.

but guys, note that the question this time comes from cs.boeing.com! if
people at boeing think about categories, and sets, and foundations, then
this probably makes a difference for them, and helps them compute
something. might this not be worth your attention?

so let me say what i think. i think foundations mean different things for
different people.

for logicians, foundations are metamathematics: analyzing consistency,
independance etc of logical theories. this is what set theory was found to
be good for.

category theory, on the other hand, is not as handy for proving new
independence results, but it tells you to look for adjunctions everywhere,
or monads, or <the keyword from your last paper>. it is not
metamathematics, but perhaps *structuralist maths*: it displays abstract
structures... (i kno, this is getting to *just* the kind of philosophy you
were hoping to avoid by the synchronized silence. so let me make the
point.)

for software engineers, foundations are the link with the meaning of their
programs. having a slightly shorter history than math, they do not have
languages as natural as arithmetic, or calculus, but have to chose between
KIF and Ontolingua, and the various other versions of esperanto every day.
categories dam the flood of structure in software engineering, just like
they originally did in homology theory almost 60 years ago. some good math
may come out of it if taken from a good side.

In the mid 70s, Anderson, Arbib, and Manes did some work on "Machines
in a Category" (SIAM, 1976) A lot of this was in support of work in
using category theory in control theory.

Can anyone provide information about the state of this research or a
bibliography of this work in unifying control theory and computation?

Best regards,

steve

I'd like to respond to Dusko's note with an open message to all; I'll try 
to be brief.  I'm grateful to Dusko for his posting, and also to the people 
who responded to me privately as I'd requested.  My only reason for requesting 
private replies was to avoid any intrusion people might feel if I started 
another thread such as the "battle" to which Dusko referred:
> 
> it's interesting that almost no one took michael healy's bait (attached).
> a couple of years ago, a similar question started a long battle between a
> group of categorists from this list, and a group of set theorists on
> another list. traces of that battle can still be found scattered on the
> web.
> 
I mean to send a compilation of the responses I received to all respondents 
because they've all expressed interest, either explicitly or implicitly by 
responding.  I've been short of time and haven't done this yet, partly 
because I also want to ask each individually if it's OK to use his/her 
name attached to the response (otherwise, said response will be included 
as "anonymous").  I will get to it within the next few weeks.  In the 
meantime, I've enjoyed this as a learning experience!

Thank you,
Mike

Re : Michael Healys question on math and AI


This is to answer Mike and also several other people who have contacted me 
recently asking how I would respond to queries about

(1)	Artificial Intelligence, cognitive science, linguistic engineering, 
knowledge representation, and related attempts at creating modern subjects, 
and

(2)	the relevance of category theory and of mathematics in general to these.

     My basic response is strong advice to actually learn some category 
theory, rather than resting content with slinging back and forth ill-defined 
epithets like set theory, contingency, etc..

So much confusion has been accumulated that an opposition of the form
set-theoretical versus non-set-theoretical has at least seven wholly 
distinct meanings, hence billions of electrons and drops of ink can be 
spilled by surreptitiously identifying any two of these.  For example, the 
opposition can concern whether or not large cardinal assumptions are needed 
for a certain result, which is mathematically meaningful and hence 
independent of whether or not the ZFvN rigidification of Cantor is being 
used as a framework.  Another example is the opposition habitually used in 
geometry between properties of spaces which can be explained in terms of 
arbitrary mappings versus those which depend on the cohesion being studied 
(e.g. the underlying abstract group vs. the Lie group). Obviously these 
two oppositions are not the same although they may be related.

One of the oppositions which I have emphasized since 1964 is
    the ZFvN rigid hierarchy based on galactically meaningful       
inclusion, requiring the totally arbitrary singleton operation of Peano 
with the resulting chains of mathematically spurious rigidified membership, 
on the one hand,
                             versus
    the category of abstract sets, involving many potential universes of
discourse and arbitrary specific relations between them, on the other hand.
(Abstract sets can CARRY structures of mathematical interest, but precisely 
because of the need of flexibility in the latter, they themselves have only 
very few properties, unlike the ZFvN sets).

Within Cantors original conception itself there is a fundamentally 
important opposition: the abstract sets, which he called Kardinalzahlen, 
versus the cohesive and variable sets which he called Mengen.  (An 
additional confusion stems from the use, by nearly all of Cantors 
followers, of the term cardinal number to mean (not a 
Kardinalzahl=abstract set, but) a label for an isomorphism class of abstract 
sets, an invariant which Cantor of course also studied, but which is too 
abstract to support the specific relations between abstract sets themselves, 
the mappings, and hence cannot carry the needed mathematical structures).

(A)    The real issue is that for purposes of pure AND applied mathematics, 
we need to be able to represent (without spurious ingredients) these 
cohesive and variable sets (or spaces) and their relationships.  The ZFvN 
rigidification fails so miserably in doing this that even those geometers 
and analysts who pay lip service to it as a foundation never in practice 
use its formalism.

(B)   Category theory made explicit some universal features of the 
relationship between quantity and quality whose fundamental importance had 
been forced into consciousness by the work of Volterra and Hurewicz (both of 
whom made basic contributions to both functional analysis and algebraic 
topology) and of many others. This relationship between quantitative and 
qualitative aspects concerns cohesive and variable sets and structures built 
on such spaces.  For example, Volterra already recognized that spaces have 
elements other than points, and Hurewicz recognized the need for 
cartesian-closed categories (even before the lambda-calculus formalism, or 
category theory, was devised); moreover, the original fiber bundles were 
explicitly modeling dynamical situations, etc.

Many people working in the new fields, striving to realize the dream of a 
theoretical computer science, do not seem to be aware of points like  (A) 
and (B). It would certainly be a bad strategy for the advancement of science 
to hide the fact that category theory belongs to the background of a new 
result and thus to help perpetuate that sort of ignorance.

The role of mathematics in general (not only of category theory) also
seems to be widely misunderstood, even in those fields which definitely need 
more mathematics in order to mature and make a real contribution.  For 
example, some say that logic is more general than mathematics, partly 
because of ignoring the strongly qualitative aspect of modern mathematics 
and partly because of the philosophical tradition of hiding the fact that no 
logic other than mathematical logic has had any significant real-world 
applications. Because of the minimal
mathematical education required of students of philosophy, the claim is too 
easily accepted in many philosophical circles that mathematics is 
unsuitable for some given issue of conceptual analysis; this conclusion 
seems to be based on the syllogism:
        mathematics is set theory (a misconception which the philosophers
themselves have done much to disseminate),
        set theory is clearly not suitable (actually because of the defects 
of the ZFvN rigidification, which make it ill-suited for mathematics as 
well)
        hence ......
This syllogism serves as an excuse to indefinitely postpone learning 
mathematics (and category theory in particular).

An older sort of excuse is the assertion that the proposed science should 
concern the REAL WORLD, not pure mathematics. This superficially appealing 
truism has frequently been used to mask the fact that comparing reality with 
existing concepts does not alone suffice to produce the level of 
understanding required to change the world; a capacity for constructing 
flexible yet reliable SYSTEMS of
concepts is needed to guide the process. This realization (not Platonism) 
was the basis of the supreme respect for mathematics expressed by champions 
of reality like Galileo, Maxwell, and Heaviside. For example, the 
differential calculus provides the capacity to construct systems descriptive 
of celestial motions, fluid interactions, electromagnetic radiation fields, 
etc., and therefore engineers have learned it. The functorial calculus helps 
to provide a similar capacity adequate to the requirements, not only of the 
older sciences,
but of the newer would-be sciences as well. Hence my response.

                 Bill Lawvere

As someone who is "striving to realize the dream of a theoretical
computer science", I would better like to understand the point that
Lawvere is making here.  Am I right in assuming that, in using terms
such as "spurious ingredients" and "rigidification", Lawvere is
referring to the fact that (to use some computer science terminology)
set theory is too much implementation and not enough specification?
That the rigid epsilon-structure of set theory cannot represent
abstract mathematical structure faithfully, without introducing
unwanted details?

If so, can category theory really do better?  Can we give some
concrete examples in both "pure AND applied mathematics" that really
make the difference in representational ability clear?  (These
questions, like the ones below, are not rhetorical or deprecatory; I'd
really like to know some answers.)

To take the first example that comes to mind, consider the cartesian
product of two objects A and B.  The "implementation" of this in set
theory as a set of ordered pairs (which are themselves specific
doubleton sets) certainly introduces some "spurious ingredients", but
the category-theoretic version has its own idiosynchrasies as well:

- Although we constantly speak of "the" product, we really only have
  "a" product (at least if we take the category-theoretic perspective
  seriously).  What is really involved, formally, in making the move
  from "a" to "the"?  A formal language translation scheme?  Coherence
  theorems?  How much technical work is really involved here?

- Related to this, what about the fact that if

      (pi0: A x B -> A, pi1: A x B -> B)

  is a product, then so is (pi1, pi0), indistinguishable categorically
  from the other product?  Does the arbitrary choice between one of
  these products introduce a "spurious ingredient"?  If we find this
  particular "implementation detail" aesthetically displeasing, can we
  abstract away from it by defining an "unordered cartesian product"?
  (I couldn't see how to do it.)

- Is there anything to be made of the fact that the set-theoretic
  cartesian product is a local construction, involving only the sets A
  and B and certain small sets made up of their elements, whereas
  a/the category-theoretic product depends on the whole category
 (because of the quantification in the universal property)?

And if these idiosynchracies do carry any weight (and I'm not claiming
that they do), why are they "better" idiosynchracies than those of the
set-theoretic cartesian product?  And, finally, shouldn't "better"
really be "better for what"?  In other words, aren't the two
communities really just arguing past one another, like people arguing
over types of automobile?  What really is the issue here?

Sorry for all the questions (and all the "really"s).

Here's a message I sent to Michael Healey privately:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
There's a minefield of hotly held opinions behind this question, but let me
try to give a couple of pragmatic considerations.

1. What is the most appropriate characterization (for present purposes) of
collections? By elements or by functions? Set theory postulates that a
collection is entirely determined by its elements. If functions are better,
that's beginning to look more like a categorical approach.

Examples:
Topology - a space is not fully defined by saying what its points are. You
only capture continuity when you look at the maps between spaces.

Type theory - syntactic terms in general have free variables in them,
effectively parameters, and these really correspond to functions rather than
simple elements.

2. Do you want to consider a variety of logics? Set theory as such is
solidly classical. To relax that you need to consider different formal
systems, and then category theory usually provides tools for achieving
better presentation independence than more syntactic approaches.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

In this hurried response to Michael's posting I was trying to get across
some sense of how category theory can help you see the wood for the trees -
the "better presentation independence" is what Dusko refers to as
"structuralist maths".

I agree.

I looked up keywords like SUO (Standard Upper Ontology) and KIF (Knowledge
Interchange Format) - they are about standard notations for expressing
information - and some key issues seemed to be rather basic things like the
meaning of first order logic.

I found this depressing. As we know, categorical logic has some very clear
accounts of this that have the great virtue of bringing out deep structure
over superficialities of the logical syntax. It also makes it easier to
question whether "self-evident" notation and axioms are actually meaningful
and valid.

But how can we bring these insights to the software engineering masses? It's
not enough to say "first learn about category theory and then look for
adjunctions, monads and <favourite keyword> everywhere". With this approach
it seems all too easy to prescribe people categorical logic as a cure for
their myopia, and then to find them trying to use it as reading glasses and
wondering why it doesn't work.

One of the things that makes Mac Lane's book such a masterpiece is the way
it uncovers category theory as something already understood rather than
presenting it as something new. The working mathematician is well familiar
with reasoning about adjunctions and monads in special cases, and it's
"just" a matter of uncovering the underlying pattern.

Speaking for myself, after all these years I still understand a lot of
category theory not in the abstract but through paradigms. Enriched
categories? They're just rings, really. Or, at least, ringoids. Presheaves?
They're just modules. Yoneda embedding? The free module on one generator is
just the ring itself.

The software engineer does not have the working mathematician's body of
knowledge. I think to give them category theory we first have to explain,
without mentioning categories, just why structure has to reside not inside
the objects but amongst the morphisms: to explain a collection by its
elements alone is not enough, even in a very basic logical framework.

Any two products are uniquely isomorphic in a way that preserves the
projections in the obvious way.  That is all that need be said.  There are
coherence statements that can be made, but they follow from the above and
are unnecessary.

The product is the product of the set {A,B}, which is equal to the set
{B,A}, but our orthography forces us to write one or the other.  Of
course, a product is really defined for {A_i|i in I} and is inherently
unordered.  In set theory, the usual A x B is quite a different set from B
x A and in category theory they are indistinguishable.  You seem to
consider that a disadvantage to category theory, but I consider it an
advantage.

Our familiar categories have regular generators and for them the product
condition can be reduced to the universal mapping condition when the
domain is/are the generator(s), which is local.  On the other hand, check
out the product in the category of affine schemes that is really
comprehensible only in terms of the categorical definition.

For another example, consider the traditional definition of Z as the set
{0,{0},{0,{0}},{0,{0}{0,{0}}},...}
and contrast that to the categorical specification.

It's not entirely clear to me what is being asserted in the second part of 
this sentence.  If what is being asserted includes the statement that the 
only logic which has had any significant real-world applications is 
mathematical logic, then this assertion is incorrect.  To give just one 
example, over the last decade the Advanced Computation Laboratory of the 
Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) in London, UK, has built intelligent 
computer decision-support systems for medical applications using logics of 
argumentation.  These logics typically use non-deductive modes of 
reasoning, and are based on the work of philosophers of argumentation 
dating from the 1950s; this work in philosophy was undertaken outside, and 
in strong opposition to, the tradition of mathematical logic.  A 
category-theoretic semantics has been provided for some of these logics of 
argumentation.    The resulting decision-support systems have found 
real-world application in cancer treatment advice, in drug prescription and 
in the automated assessment of chemical properties, such as toxicity and 
carcinogenicity.   Moreover, current research in Artificial Intelligence is 
developing the use of non-deductive argumentation formalisms for automated 
dialogues between autonomous software agents in multi-agent systems, work 
that is likely to form the basis of next-generation e-commerce systems.

Re : Michael Healy's question on math and AI


This is to answer Mike and also several other people who have contacted me
recently asking how I would respond to queries about

(1)	Artificial Intelligence, cognitive science, linguistic engineering,
knowledge representation, and related attempts at creating modern subjects, 
and

(2)	the relevance of category theory and of mathematics in general to 
these.

     My basic response is strong advice to actually learn some category
theory, rather than resting content with slinging back and forth 
ill-defined
epithets like "set theory", "contingency", etc..

So much confusion has been accumulated that an opposition of the form
"set-theoretical versus non-set-theoretical" has at least seven wholly
distinct meanings, hence billions of electrons and drops of ink can be
spilled by surreptitiously identifying any two of these.  For example, the
opposition can concern whether or not large cardinal assumptions are needed 
for a certain result, which is mathematically meaningful and hence
independent of whether or not the ZFvN rigidification of Cantor is being
used as a framework.  Another example is the opposition habitually used in
geometry between properties of spaces which can be explained in terms of
arbitrary mappings versus those which depend on the cohesion being studied
(e.g. "the underlying abstract group vs. the Lie group"). Obviously these
two oppositions are not the same although they may be related.

One of the oppositions which I have emphasized since 1964 is
    the ZFvN rigid hierarchy based on galactically "meaningful"
inclusion, requiring the totally arbitrary "singleton" operation of Peano
with the resulting chains of mathematically spurious rigidified membership, 
on the one hand,
                             versus
    the category of abstract sets, involving many potential universes of
discourse and arbitrary specific relations between them, on the other hand.
(Abstract sets can CARRY structures of mathematical interest, but precisely 
because of the need of flexibility in the latter, they themselves have only 
very few properties, unlike the ZFvN "sets").

Within Cantor's original conception itself there is a fundamentally
important opposition: the abstract sets, which he called "Kardinalzahlen",
versus the cohesive and variable sets which he called "Mengen".  (An
additional confusion stems from the use, by nearly all of Cantor's
followers, of the term "cardinal number" to mean (not a
Kardinalzahl=abstract set, but) a label for an isomorphism class of 
abstract
sets, an invariant which Cantor of course also studied, but which is too
abstract to support the specific relations between abstract sets 
themselves,
the mappings, and hence cannot carry the needed mathematical structures).

(A)    The real issue is that for purposes of pure AND applied mathematics, 
we need to be able to represent (without spurious ingredients) these
cohesive and variable sets (or "spaces") and their relationships.  The ZFvN 
rigidification fails so miserably in doing this that even those geometers
and analysts who pay lip service to it as a "foundation" never in practice
use its formalism.

(B)   Category theory made explicit some universal features of the
relationship between quantity and quality whose fundamental importance had
been forced into consciousness by the work of Volterra and Hurewicz (both 
of
whom made basic contributions to both functional analysis and algebraic
topology) and of many others. This relationship between quantitative and
qualitative aspects concerns cohesive and variable sets and structures 
built
on such spaces.  For example, Volterra already recognized that spaces have
"elements" other than points, and Hurewicz recognized the need for
cartesian-closed categories (even before the lambda-calculus formalism, or
category theory, was devised); moreover, the original fiber bundles were
explicitly modeling dynamical situations, etc.

Many people working in the new fields, striving to realize the dream of a
theoretical computer science, do not seem to be aware of points like  (A)
and (B). It would certainly be a bad strategy for the advancement of 
science
to "hide" the fact that category theory belongs to the background of a new
result and thus to help perpetuate that sort of ignorance.

The role of mathematics in general (not only of category theory) also
seems to be widely misunderstood, even in those fields which definitely 
need
more mathematics in order to mature and make a real contribution.  For
example, some say that logic is more general than mathematics, partly
because of ignoring the strongly qualitative aspect of modern mathematics
and partly because of the philosophical tradition of hiding the fact that 
no
logic other than mathematical logic has had any significant real-world
applications. Because of the minimal
mathematical education required of students of philosophy, the claim is too 
easily accepted in many philosophical circles that "mathematics is
unsuitable" for some given issue of conceptual analysis; this conclusion
seems to be based on the syllogism:
        mathematics is set theory (a misconception which the philosophers
themselves have done much to disseminate),
        set theory is clearly not suitable (actually because of the defects 
of the ZFvN rigidification, which make it ill-suited for mathematics as
well)
        hence ......
This syllogism serves as an excuse to indefinitely postpone learning
mathematics (and category theory in particular).

An older sort of excuse is the assertion that the proposed science should
concern the REAL WORLD, not pure mathematics. This superficially appealing
truism has frequently been used to mask the fact that comparing reality 
with
existing concepts does not alone suffice to produce the level of
understanding required to change the world; a capacity for constructing
flexible yet reliable SYSTEMS of
concepts is needed to guide the process. This realization (not Platonism)
was the basis of the supreme respect for mathematics expressed by champions 
of reality like Galileo, Maxwell, and Heaviside. For example, the
differential calculus provides the capacity to construct systems 
descriptive
of celestial motions, fluid interactions, electromagnetic radiation fields, 
etc., and therefore engineers have learned it. The functorial calculus 
helps
to provide a similar capacity adequate to the requirements, not only of the 
older sciences,
but of the newer would-be sciences as well. Hence my response.

	Actually, nothing is involved if we introduce a product operator.
That is, we take operators _x_, p0_,_ p1_,_ and say:

For any objects (or types) A and B the object AxB has arrows

p0A,B:AxB --> A   and p1A,B:AxB -->B with the properties of a categorical
product.

	Notice that the categorical property is exactly what you want in a
product type: From a record of type AxB you can recover the A entry, and
the B entry, via the projections. And whenever you have a pair of values,
one in A and one in B, there is a correspondng single value in AxB.
Notice, the "values" may be parametrized, so we are actually dealing with
operations f:T-->A and g:T-->B and the resulting (f,g):T-->AxB.

	Then AxB will generally not be the only product of A and B in the
category, but it will be one, and that is what we need. Coherence theorems
indeed are important. But they are provable from the above. So there is no
need to give them as part of specifying the product--the same as a computer
need not have the Chinese remainder theorem programmed into it, to
implement arithmetic.

	Sadly, that is not a fact. The pair (pi0,pi1) gives a product of A
and B, while (pi1,pi0) gives a product of B and A. This is revealed
categorically by the fact that the codomain of pi0 is A, while the
codomain of pi1 is B.

	In programming terms, a data record of <your age in years, your
height in inches> is different from a record of <your height in inches,
your age in years>. It is quite important practically, as well as
theoretically, to distinguish the product of A and B from that of B and A.

	Even in a product BxB we need to keep the projections in order. For
example, that is how we distinguish between pairs <x,y> of reals with x
less than y, and pairs <x,y> of reals with y less than x. An important
distinction. This is why a correct specification of the categorical product
specifies the projection arrows as p0_,_ p1_,_, or in words:

	"projection to the first of the following two objects"

and	"projection to the second of the following two objects"

	This is one reason why a computer implementation of the categorical
product, in any reasonably rich environment, will be incomplete. But it
pales beside other reasons why computer implementations of any reasonably
strong construction are incomplete. The ZF set-theoretic product will also
be incomplete in any computer implementation

	Compare the way Goedel's theorem shows that computer implementations of
arithmetic will all be incomplete. It pales beside the fact that normal
implementations don't try to implement induction at all.

	There are many different issues, and correspondingly different
arguments. Which one did you mean to address?

I mean the initial algebra for the theory with a nullary operation 0:1 -->
N and a unary operation s:N --> N.  1 stands for the terminal object
(empty product).

One might say that the ordering of binary products, with a first projection
and a second projection, is spurious but inevitable.  

The two components of a binary product must be distinguished, as Colin
McLarty explained, but they must be allowed to be isomorphic.  The usual
way we handle a situation like this in mathematics is to index them, in
this case by a two-element set.  One could use {red,blue}.  As far as I
know, in Western culture, this set has no canonical ordering, but
nevertheless one knows that there is a redth component and a blueth
component and they might or might not be different objects.  

However, in practice the index set is {0,1}, {1,2} or {x,y} (the latter in
analytic geometry).  All of these are canonically totally ordered in our
culture, so inevitably binary products do have an order in practice.

Executive summary of a long reply
-------------------------------------------------

* Spaces - for instance topological spaces - cannot always be analysed as
set + structure.
* Category theory enables structure to be found amongst the
morphisms.(generalized elements) instead of within the objects (amongst
concrete elements in a set-theoretic analysis).
* Variation of kind of space bears some relation to variation of logic.
* The logical questions are important in computer science, even if topology
and geometry at first appear not to be.
------------------------------------------------------------------


The discussion of Cartesian product does illustrate set theory vs.
categories as implementation vs. specification, and, sure, there's a lot to
be said for specifying categorically before you implement set-theoretically.

However, Bill's point is much deeper than that. He is saying that set theory
is actually inadequate as an implementation language in many contexts.

I'll set out my own understanding of this, but I hope I'm not
misrepresenting Bill if I draw on his note.

I think within his note you already see two criticisms of set theory.

The less deep of the two is of the "rigidity" of the epsilon-structure. Most
mathematicians would probably agree that it doesn't make much sense to
investigate the elements of pi (say), yet still view set theory as a
remarkably successful encoding of mathematics into an epsilon-structure,
successful enough to be used as foundations.

The deeper criticism is that even for things that are unambiguously
collections of some kind, so they really do have elements, the set-theoretic
approach is inadequate. Bill refers to "cohesive and variable sets (or
`spaces')", and I take it that an example of "cohesive" set is a topological
space. There it is not enough to know merely what the elements are. They
also "cohere", sit in rather subtle relationship with each other. Maps
should respect the coherence, i.e. be continuous.

One way to view this is that in order to know the coherence in a space X you
need to know not just its "point-like" elements but also its line-like,
plane-like or any-shape-you-choose elements - as Bill said, "Volterra
already recognized that spaces have elements other than points". These are
the "generalized elements", the maps from other spaces to X. Hence in the
category of spaces the structure of X is seen not within the object but
amongst the morphisms.

Correspondingly, we get two approaches to topological spaces.

1) Set theory - structure within objects. Space = set + topology. The
topology provides criteria so that out of all the functions, mostly
discontinuous, between the sets of points, some can be identified as
continuous.

2) Category theory - structure amongst morphisms. We are now free to
describe the objects in point-free ways, for instance the frames of locale
theory, the schemes of algebraic geometry, or Grothendieck toposes as
generalized spaces, and still hope to get (via the generalized elements) a
good spatial feel for the objects.

Given a choice, why use the point-free ways at all?

But in fact there's less of a choice than one might think, as the geometers
discovered.

Approach (1) does not generalize well to situations where you want to vary
the set theory. This want arises naturally, for concrete mathematical
reasons, when you start working with sheaves, since the class of sheaves
over a space provides a non-standard set theory, usually non-classical, and
one in which rigid "element of" or "subset of" are not useful. As you vary
the set theory there are ways of transforming sets in one to sets in
another, but it turns out that sets of points of spaces cannot be
transformed in the same way: the space and its set of points part company.
[See Appendix for a technical discussion.]

Examples thus show that the decomposition "space = set + topology" is not
stable under change of set theory.

The inadequacies of point-set topology are well known in constructive
mathematics, where the point-set statements of important results such as the
Heine-Borel theorem turn out to be false while point-free versions still
hold.

Note that category theory in itself doesn't tell you what category to use
(sheaves? locales? toposes? schemes?). But it does help you to see what you
are looking for in a category of spaces that goes beyond space =
set+structure.

Computer science
---------------------------

That was a long preamble to say Beware! Spaces might not be sets!

But why should workers on Knowledge Interchange Formats worry about this?
Why can't they just use first-order logic, assume a classical set-theoretic
semantics and keep well away from sheaves?

One reason lies in the classical first-order logic itself. It works in a
blandly uniform way on its formulae that ignores any difference in status as
knowledge. For instance, maybe a knowledge database should distinguish
between formulae that represent observed facts and those that represent
background assumptions or scientific hypotheses. It could make a difference
to what negation means or how negation behaves. But such nuances are not
present in classical first-order logic.

These logical questions could be a natural part of the theory of knowledge
representation.

The interesting thing is that the variability of logic can be connected to
the possible un-set-likeness of spaces. When you replace set theory's
elements by category theory's generalized elements, you sometimes get a
calculus that's almost like set theory but with different logic. For
instance, intuitionistic logic (internal logic of toposes) for sheaves,
geometric logic for spaces. The effect is of enabling the point-free spaces
and maps to be handled just like sets and functions - describe a space by
its points, define a map without needing to prove continuity - but with a
funny logic.

Hence although Knowledge Interchange Formats might seem a million miles away
from topology or algebraic geometry, subtle logical questions might create
direct links. (My particular favourite is geometric logic, whose distinction
between formulae and sentences actually looks quite like that between
observed facts and background assumptions.)

Steve Vickers.

Appendix
-------------
Let f: X -> Y be a map between spaces and let f^* be the inverse image
functor on sheaves. It is the way of transforming "sets over Y" to "sets
over X". If p: Z -> Y is a local homeomorphism - one way of describing a
sheaf - then its inverse image f^*(p): f^*(Z) -> X is just the pullback of p
along f. Just from the categorical property of pullback one can say that the
(generalized) points of f^*(Z) are the pairs (x,z), x a point of X and z a
point of Z, such that f(x) = p(z).

Now it makes good sense to say that a space over Y is just an arbitrary map
(not necessarily a local homeomorphism) g: W -> Y and again it is natural to
use pullback to transform it to a space g': Z' -> X over X. Any such space
over Y has a corresponding sheaf over Y, its "set of points". However, f^*
of the set of points is not in general the set of points of the pullback
space.

Two points.

First, even in computer programming, one can lose the need for an ordering
by using what are often called "record types", so that

  <your age in years=99, your height in inches=70>

denotes the same record as

   <your height in inches=70, your age in years=99>

I don't think there's anything mysterious about this. A pair of sets can be
described as a function f: X -> 2, and we can quite happily replace 2 by any
isomorphic set (but we don't have to choose the isomorphism) such as

   M = {"your height in inches", "your age in years"}

The product of f: X -> M is then a universal solution to the problem of
finding

   g: YxM -> X  over M

and this is equivalent to the usual characterization once you have chosen
the isomorphism between M and 2.

A second, and deeper, point is that constructively there are unorderable
2-element sets, so there is a kind of binary product in which the ordering
first vs. second projection is impossible. It uses the same "record type"
construction.

An example in sheaves over the circle O is the twisted double cover M (edge
of a Mobius band). It is finite decidable set with cardinality 2. It is
isomorphic to 2 (i.e. 2xO) locally but not globally. It has no global
elements and no global total ordering. If you have a sheaf X with a map f: X
-> M, then locally it falls into two parts whose product you can take. It
can be expressed as

  Pi f = {(i,x,j,y) in MxXxX | f(x) = i and f(y) = j and j = s(i)} / ~

where s: M -> M swaps the two elements and ~ is the equivalence relation
generated by (i,x,j,y) ~ (j,y,i,x).

Globally, Pi f is the equalizer of two maps from X^M to M^M, namely f^M and
the constant identity map: so set theoretically it is the set of sections,

   {g: M -> X | g;f = Id_M}

The universal property is that for any YxM -> X over M you get a unique
corresponding Y -> Pi f.

The second description with X^M probably looks more natural to a topos
theorist, but the first one has the advantage of being geometric.
 

Steve.

At the risk of putting my head on a platter (as Mike Barr 
said).....If you take the point of view of ``representable functors", 
an object P, together with an orderded pair of arrows (pr_A:P --->A, 
pr_B:P---->B) is a product of A with B iff for all objects T, the 
mapping Hom(T,P)--->Hom(T,A)xHom(T,B) defined by 
f|---->(f.pr_A,f.pr_B) is a bijection. If you compose this map with 
the bijection
(a,b)|--->(b,a): Hom(T,A)xHom(T,B)--->Hom(T,B)xHom(T,A), you get that 
P, together with the ordered pair of arrows ( pr_B:P---->B, pr_A:P 
--->A) represents a "product of B with A". and this is different even 
if we are talking about a product of A with itself. In other words, 
the "product we usually are thinking about"  is universal for ordered 
pairs of arrows (a:T--->A,b:T--->B). If this means that "ordered 
pair" needs to be made a primitive notion within the underlying logic 
(as the Bourbakists did), so be it, because the simple translation of 
the above statement out of "set theoretic" terms" into "category 
theoretic" terms (no Hom-sets allowed) needs the notion of "ordered 
pair" in order to state it independently of any overarching "theory 
of sets".

 It seems that a discussion "CT vs. ST " (despite some silent resistance 
at the beginning :) has nevertheless started in this list too, and is 
going in a few different directions ranging from rather technical thru 
methodological to philosophical aspects. Probably it's unavoidable (and
useful) when we talk about math in general and its applications but, as 
Bill Lawvere pointed, too much quite different stuff is packed into the 
same title of CTvsST and the type mismatch in the very discussion and 
its comprehension by the (rather diverse as I could guess) audience is
very possible. (Under type mismatch I mean something like this. Suppose 
we discuss the result of  multiplication 3 x 3. If the alternatives  are 
8,9 and, say, 12, we have good chances for a reasonable discussion, and 
if even the alternatives are 12, 37 and 111, type correctness is still 
respected and we have chances to achieve useful results, but if the 
alternatives to be discussed are 8, 9, that triangle and that <favorite 
keyword>, the situation is hopeless). So, some methodological 
arrangement and figuring out explicitly the relevant meanings of the 
CTvsST-problem would be useful.
 Here are a few contexts already touched in the discussion, where we 
deal with methodologically quite different problems whose merging under 
the same title CTvsST may be misleading.

 a). Ways of setting/defining math structures.

 The actual meaning of CTvsST here is the opposition between the 
following two ways (described by Steve Vickers yesterday, I'll just 
rephrase slightly his presentation).

--(1)  Math structure  Carrying set (of abstract elements) + 
Structure over it defined in terms of the elements (so, structure 
resides in elements of the carrier).

--(2)  Math structure  Category (collection of abstract objects and 
their morphisms) + Structure over it defined in terms of the morphisms 
(and then structure on a carrier object  resides in morphisms adjoint to 
it).

 The title CTvsST may be misleading here since in the both ways we use 
sets, their elements, mappings between them. To name the two ways 
somehow, I'd propose to call the 1st  one Boubakian (since this way of 
setting math structures got its classical completion in Bourbaki's 
volumes), and the 2nd one categorical. So, the actual opposition here is 
CatStr vs. BrbStr (but, of course, a category with structure is itself a 
Bourbakian math structure)

 This opposition is of extreme great relevance for software engineering, 
business modeling, knowledge representation ... but even brief outline 
of the reasons needs a more detailed description of the issue. Let's 
postpone that for a next posting. 

 b). Modeling (formalization) of set theory underlying the setting for 
math structures and reasoning about them (usually referred to as 
foundations).

 The actual meaning of CTvsST here is "categorical set theory" vs. 
"formal set theory(ies)" (ZF, NBG,...), or CatST vs. FrmST.

 This context and meaning are totally irrelevant to applications i 
question and asking about what is better, CT or ST, for applications in 
AI,SE, ... is very much like asking what is better for applications in 
mechanical engineering: the differential/integral calculi or ST;  or  
what is better for general theory of relativity, the tensor calculus or 
ST etc. 

 c). Modeling (formalization) of reasoning about math structures (often 
called metamathematics)

 Of course, what we have here depends on which way of setting math 
structures we consider: Bourbakian or categorical. Nevertheless, it's 
possible and make sense to treat reasoning about Bourbakian  structures 
categorically and, say, to treat reasoning about categories in a 
elementwise fashion.

 We again have two different approaches. Historically first (originated 
by Tarsky and Mal'cev) was formalization of first order logic (FOL, 
including syntax and semantics) in a quite immediate way now well known 
to a wide audience of quite different backgrounds including computer 
scientists and philosophers. This way is often referred to as "Tarskian 
formalization of the notion of truth", and let's call this entire style 
Tarskian MetaMathematics, TarMMath.

 The other approach was developed in CT and is usually called  
categorical logic, CatLog. So, the opposition we actually have here is 
CatLog vs. TarMMath, or, if you prefer, CatMMath vs. TarMMath.

 This oppostion, though of course connected with that in (a), CatStr vs. 
BrbStr, has its own peculiarities which are of extreme high relevance 
for knowledge representation, business modeling and similar domains. So, 
details here would be very useful but I'd again postpone them for a next
posting.

 So, as it was said in Lawvere's note, there are a few aspects of CTvsST 
(understood in the wide sense), some of them may be not relevant for 
applications (for example, b) while others are of great importance and 
deserve more detailed exposition (a,c).  On the other hand, all the 
three context we have considered are special cases of a quite general 
intellectual activity usually referred to as modeling. Mathematics is 
itself a special (very refined) discipline of modeling, and foundations 
and meta-mathematics are nothing but modeling math by math means (well, 
there are other means, say, philosophical :). It seems that to make 
these contexts more understandable for a wider audience (and for myself 
:), not only more details should be provided but some sketch of what 
modeling in general and math modeling in particular are, would be also 
useful. So, I'd ventured to sketch some general tutorial on applying 
math to engineering domains and to itself but certainly it's for a next 
posting.
