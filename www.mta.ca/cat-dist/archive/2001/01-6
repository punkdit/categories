Dear All 
I replied to Bill Rowan directly yesterday but it now seems that others
might be interested in my reply so here it is.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

In my book with Cordier, the result you want is Proposition 4 p 42 (The
book is :Categorical Shape Theory, Cordier and Porter, Published by
Ellis Horwood, 1989).  The result is known to some shape theorists as
the Mardesic trick as Sibe Mardesic is thought to have found it, but I
seem to remember seeing a version of it in Grothendieck's work (SGA4 and
earlier) If you can get a copy of our book there is a reasonably
categorical treatment of pro categories.   
   Best wishes,

Paul raised an interesting question.  However, my experience with both
kinds of journals leads me to believe that the commercial publishers keep
hands off the day-to-day issues of the sort he raises.  I could imagine an
extreme case in which the publisher might step in, but I have never seen
it happen.  There is invariably an academic editor-in-chief (who, in the
case of a commercial journal, gets paid an amount which was once described
to me as "substantial", with no details) and I have never heard of an
author going beyond that level, although they could try.

I would like to take exception to Paul's "NOTHING AT ALL" comment. As far
as I can tell, the value added by commercial publishers is actually
NEGATIVE, since by owning the copyright they attempt to keep the papers
out of general circulation.  An Elsevier flack writing to respond to my
posting two years ago tried to justify price increases in the face of
falling costs by raising the issue of paper costs.  Now I buy a sheet of
letter-size paper for about 1 cent (and the shriveled Canadian cent at
that).  I don't know what Elsevier pays, but I would be surprised if they
pay half of that.  But maybe the common market supports the price of
paper, so take that 1 c as given.  JPAA costs about $4000 for 2000 pages
(that's Canadian $).  So it costs $2 per page.  Now tell me how a rise in
the cost of paper can be a significant cause in the doubling of the
subscription price over the decade?  The flack made other, equally
spurious claims.  

In the past five years all my papers have been published in TAC, in
Cahiers, and I now have one submitted to the electronic HHA (Homology,
Homotopy and Applications).

A slightly more recent exposition is given in 

D. A. Edwards and H. M. Hastings, Cech and Steenrod homotopy theories with
applications to geometric topology, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 542,
Springer, 1976

on pages 6--7.  It is a bit strange that Edwards and Hastings credit
Mardesic and do not mention Deligne.  Understandably, they must have been
more familiar with the literature on shape theory than on algebraic
geometry.

As the publisher of the non-commercial category-theoretic Journal

"Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle Categoriques" 

I have read with interest Michael Barr's Newsletter on Serials Pricing and
the following postings on the subject. I would like to add some information
on the "effective" cost of publishing, and also answer a question of Tom
Leinster which could be of interest to the authors who have published or
want to publish in the "Cahiers".

The "Cahiers" have been created by Charles Ehresmann about 40 years ago.
>From 1967 to 1972, they were printed and distributed by the commercial
editor Dunod. When Dunod merged with Bordas, he refused to go on because
there was no "profit".

At that time Charles and I decided to undertake the publication ourselves,
and since the death of my husband in 1979, I assume this job alone. I have
no support nor material help whatsoever from any institution. If the
address is at the Faculte de Mathematique of the Universite de Picardie, it
is just because it is my own professional address. 

As many people of this category list know, to avoid typesetting problems,
after the papers have been refereed and accepted, authors are required to
send me laser printed copies of the papers in a specific format, to which I
add the title, name of authors, headings and page numbers. 
I give the so prepared volume to a (commercial) printer who prints and
binds it. The mailing of the issues as well as the handling of
subscriptions is done by myself.

The only resources come from the subscriptions (almost all from foreign
universities, of which about 100 in the USA). For this year, the price is
460 Francs for 320 pages; thus, depending on the dollar rate, it amounts to
less than 0.20 $ for a page. This price is fixed so that if just covers the
printing and mailing costs, and a small part of the material costs (printer
ink, computer,...). 

The "Cahiers" have some exchange with "TAC" since each year "TAC" contents
are published in the second issue of the "Cahiers" volume, while "Cahiers"
contents are mailed to this category list.

Now an answer to Tom Leinster who asks:
> What I'd like to find is that it is actually possible to publish in
respected
>journals while keeping my papers free to whoever wants them.  
>So my first question is: which journals have enlightened policies?  

I don't know if the "Cahiers" are "respected". But I can assert that my
policy is to allow the authors to keep their papers free to whoever wants
them. Indeed, the papers can be freely posted in any electronic archive
(with  reference to the volume where they are published) and/or
photocopied, if the 50 reprints I send free are not sufficient. 

Any suggestion to make the "Cahiers" more useful to the category community
will be appreciated.

			Andree C. Ehresmann

Hello,

   Research in graph term rewriting is being done
in regard to functional language implementation.
Have Category Theoretic methods been applied to
graph term rewriting research? If so, can someone
point me at papers?

Regards,

Bill Halchin

To my best knowledge, Fabio Gadducci has, for some time now,
been applying category-theoretic structures to graph term rewriting,
and has written a couple of relevant survey papers which feature
extensive bibliographic references. I believe these papers may be
found in his home page (http://www.di.unipi.it/~gadducci/) even though
his links may seem a bit cryptic at first. 

My understanding of your question is that you're interested in
rewriting graphs which encode the structure of terms in some signature
(or the structure of program terms in some programming language). If,
instead, it is the rewriting of graphs (independent of specific
interpretations) or of programs in visual languages that you are
interested in, then I would be happy to provide more specific
pointers, as the latter area of research is closer to my own
interests.

   I take this opportunity to thank Andree C. Ehresmann for all she has
done and is still doing in order to keep the "Cahiers" going and in good
health. The contribution of the cahiers to the category theory community
is inmense, and even more was so during all those years when there was not
electronic printing. We all in this community have a great debt to Mme
Andree, and I feel we should let her know explicitly how important her
work has been and still is.
   Personally, every time I have to reference a good article, I never
remember in which journal it was published, except if it was the
cahiers. It may be that the cahiers is close to my heart. 
   Good job Andree, and keep going ...
                                              Eduardo J. Dubuc

You may wish to look at Wolfram Kahl's publications, and the HOPS project:

  http://ist.unibw-muenchen.de/kahl/

For example:

  Wolfram Kahl. A Fibred Approach to Rewriting - How the Duality between
    Adding and Deleting Cooperates with the Difference between Matching and
    Rewriting.  Technical Report Nr. 9702, Fakultät für Informatik,
    Universität der Bundeswehr München, May 1997.

Then there is Neil Ghani's work on categorical rewriting with Christopher
Lüth, though I don't think it is specific to graph rewriting:

  http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/~nghani/catrew.html

And there is a lot of work on linear languages by Blute, Cockett, Seely et
al. which touches on rewriting. For example,

  Natural Deduction and Coherence for Weakly Distributive Categories
       (Blute-Cockett-Seely-Trimble) (JPAA 113(1996)3, pp 229-296)

which is available on Seely's page here:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives
==========

Object-based Distributed Computing is being established as the most
pertinent basis for the support of large, heterogeneous computing and
telecommunication systems. Indeed, several important international
organisations, such as ITU, ISO, OMG, TINA-C, etc. are defining
similar distributed object-based frameworks as a foundation for open
distributed computing.

The advent of Open Object-based Distributed Systems - OODS - brings
new challenges and opportunities for the use and development of formal
methods.  New architectures and system models are emerging (e.g., the
enterprise, information, computational and engineering viewpoints of
the ITU-T/ISO/IEC ODP Reference Model) which require formal notational
support. Usual design issues such as specification, verification,
refinement, and testing need to take into account new dimensions
introduced by distribution and openness, such as quality of service
and dependability constraints, dynamic binding and reconfiguration,
consistency between multiple models and viewpoints, security etc. OODS
is a challenging research context and a source of motivation for
semantical models of object-based systems and notations, for the
evolution of standardised formal description techniques, for the
application and assessment of logic based approaches, for better

For many (categorical) notions,
there is a useful (often fantastic) dual notion.

What about iteration?

In a category with finite coproducts,
we have a notion of iteration   f:A-->A+B
(written A -f-> A+B here)
which in the case of sets and partial functions, for example,
is completely specified by the Elgot equation
   A -f-> A+B -f"+1-> B =  A -f"-> B  recursive in  f"
(plus one more little, quite natural condition - see [Manes '92])
This awful looking mess, written using the infix morphism notation,
actually looks quite neat when you draw the diagram.

Now without meaning to start the "co"-wars again,
- is there a useful notion of co-iteration?
- what could it do for us, say in the category of partial functions?
- is there a simple algebra/coalgebra context?

To put it in a nutshell, the dual of iteration is recursion. You start
with a function f:AxB-->A, and you obtain a function f":B-->A
satisfying B -f"x1-> AxB -f-> A = B -f"-> A. This is precisely dual to
the situation you describe. 

In a programming language context, much more can be said. Andrzej
Filinski observed in his 1989 Master's thesis that call-by-*name*
recursion is dual to call-by-*value* iteration. In the presence of
certain control operators, call-by-value iteration is in turns
inter-definable with call-by-value recursion. The typing of these
statements is as follows:

1) Call-by-name recursion:   AxB -> A
                            ----------
                              B -> A

2) Call-by-value iteration:  A -> A+B
                            ----------
                              A -> B

3) Call-by-value recursion:  (A->C)xB -> (A->C)
                            --------------------
                                 B -> (A->C)

Here, in 1), AxB stands for a categorical product. In 2), A+B is a
categorical co-product. However, in 3), the "product" type AxB is not
a categorical product (not even a tensor product - in fact it is a
premonoidal structure). And the "function space" A->C is not that of a
cartesian (or monoidal) closed structure. Thus, there is a bit more to
call-by-value recursion than meets the eye.

All this is explained very nicely (both categorically and from a
lambda calculus point of view) in a recent paper by Masahito Hasegawa
and Yoshihiko Kakutani. The paper appeared in FoSSaCS 2001, and it is
available from Hasegawa's website
(http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~hassei/papers/). In particular, this
paper discusses precisely which axioms to require of the operations
1), 2), and 3), and it details the duality between 1) and 2) and the
equivalence of 2) and 3). 

I may add, although it is not directly in response to the original
question, that the duality between call-by-name and call-by-value can
already be observed even in languages that don't have recursion or
iteration. The duality requires the presence of a certain kind of
control operator. This duality also appears in Filinski's master's
thesis, and its category theoretic meaning is explained in my
paper "Control Categories and Duality"
(http://theory.stanford.edu/~selinger/papers.html).

by reversing the arrows, and replacing coproducts by products, we get
that, for the function g:AxB->A holds

B--<g',id>-->AxB--g-->A = B--g'-->A, ie g(g'(y),y) = g'(y)

in words, the "coiterator" g' is just a fixpoint of g.

	           Deadline August 3rd, 2001

Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium (CATS) is the premier
theoretical computer science conference in Australasia.  It is held
annually as part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW).

CATS 2002 will be the eighth in the series.  The symposium will consist
of invited speakers and research paper presentations.

Date and location

CATS 2002 will be held during the Australasian Computer Science Week.
ACSW 2002 will take place at Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria,
Australia, from 28th January to 1st February, 2002.

Scope 

CATS covers all aspects of theoretical computer science.  Some
representative, but not exclusive, topics include the following:

	o logic, reasoning and verification
	o formal specification techniques and program semantics
	o formal development methods, program refinement, synthesis and transformation
	o concurrent, parallel and distributed system theory
	o algorithms and data structures
	o complexity and computability
	o automata, number and category theory
	o tools for automated reasoning, and program analysis and development


Research paper submissions to CATS 2002 should be prepared according
to the formatting requirements below and sent to the Programme Chair,
to arrive no later than Friday, 3rd August, 2001.  Submissions must be
original work, not published or submitted elsewhere.  All submissions
will be refereed.

The proceedings of CATS 2002 will be published by Elsevier Science in
their series Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science
(http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs) ENTCS is an electronic series
associated with the journal Theoretical Computer Science, and
published by Elsevier Science B. V.  (Institutions subscribing to TCS
can access full papers in ENTCS on-line.)  ENTCS offers rapid,
worldwide dissemination of research results, an absence of page
limits, and long-term accessibility through the electronic archives
that Elsevier maintains.

The proceedings of CATS2000 and CATS2001 have both appeared in ENTCS as
ENTCS Volume 31 (http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs/volume31.html)
and 
ENTCS Volume 42 (http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs/volume42.html)
respectively. 

A hardcopy preliminary proceedings will be provided to conference
attendees.

Formatting requirements

To ensure a uniform format for papers, all submissions to CATS 2002
*must* be prepared in LaTeX using the ENTCS macros.  Papers in
other formats cannot be accepted.  Further information is available
via the ENTCS home page at http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs.
(Follow the links for "Instructions for Submissions" and "Technical
Requirements".)  Complete papers should be e-mailed as PostScript
files, preferably as MIME attachments.

Although there is no strict page limit on submissions to CATS 2002, 
authors are strongly encouraged to be as concise as possible.  Papers
between 10 and 15 pages are considered ideal.  If necessary,
definitions and proofs not essential to understanding the paper should
be relegated to appendices to appear only in the electronic version.

Call for Posters

A poster session will be arranged to give CATS attendees the
opportunity to give informal presentations of their work.  Expressions
of interest, briefly outlining the poster's topic, should be e-mailed
to the Programme Chair (jah@cs.rmit.edu.au) by Friday 9th November,
2001.

Important dates

Friday 3rd August, 2001: Deadline for submissions
Friday 5th October, 2001: Notification of acceptance

I recently noticed the following fact, and wondered
if this was known, and if so, whether there was a 
reference. 

Write w for the first infinite ordinal (pronounced omega, and
thought of as a category). The free completion under w-colimits
of a category K can be described as the category of fractions
[w,K][S^-1], where [w,K] is the functor category, and S consists
of all natural transformations of the form A(phi):A-->Af,
where A:w-->K and f:w-->w are functors, and phi:1_w-->f a 
natural transformation.

Both symmetry and duality are important concepts, for sure;
both conjure up images of "2-ness" (or 2-folded-ness or 2-sided-ness ...).
However, their similarities and differences are problematic to me,
and I'm seeking either agreement or objection from this forum
to my remarks, plus a question on definition.

An over-simplified picture (perhaps trivial) that begins to distinguish
between these two fundamental aspects of 2-ness is the following:
symmetry:
.   ----------->
o                      o
.   ----------->        ie. confluence
vs.
duality
.   ---------->
o                      o
.   <-----------         ie. unity of opposites

"Symmetry is a vast subject, significant in art and nature"
said Hermann Weyl in his 1952 Princeton UP book "Symmetry".
As is well known, his mathematical approach culminates in the understanding
of symmetric configurations of elements as invariants under subgroups
of the group of automorphisms of their ambient structures.
This, of course, relates strongly to the famous Erlanger Program (1872)
of Felix Klein which sees geometry as the study of the properties of a space
that are preserved (invariant) under a given group of transformations,
whereby a geometry is distinguished by the group of transformations
under which its theorems remain true.

Duality is also a very important and far-reaching subject -
and certainly no need to recite further in this forum.

In terms of comparisons of similarities and differences,
I am tempted to attach the follow descriptions:
symmetry .......... vs. ............. duality
........2-ness................................2-ness
.. metric (or measure) related........order related
... visual................................complementary
..... causal parallel......................dialectic
.... syntactic..............................syntactic
.... concrete..................................abstract
.. invariance under transformation.....adjointness
.. geometric in character...........algebraic in character
...  confluence..........................unity of opposites

.... are there others that come to mind?

In the vernacular, symmetry and duality are sometimes used interchangeably,
both referring to 2-ness:  the quality, character or condition of being
two or twofold - a dichotomy.
Indeed it has been suggested that visual symmetry,
in the sense of exact correspondence of form and constituent
configuration on opposite sides of a dividing line or plane or about a
center or an axis, is a source of beauty as a result of this balance or
harmonious arrangement.
Alternatively, symmetry has also been seen more abstractly (vs. visually) as
a relationship of equivalence, identity, or characteristic correspondence
among constituents of an entity or between different entities, such as in:
the narrative symmetry of a novel. This level of abstraction is certainly
evident in the philosophical "Mind Body Problem" whose classical exposition
in the form of dualistic interactionism is due to René Descartes.

Both symmetry and duality should be seen as sources
of beauty in mathematics also,
however, in order to be addressed mathematically.
these should be precise.
The categorical notion of duality is captured precisely by adjointness,
or the unity and identity of opposites.
So finally, here is the question:
is there a (universal) categorical description of symmetry?

My hope is that precise formulations will allow me to better understand
heuristic notions such as wave-particle duality or symmetry-breaking etc.
in terms of (model) structures.

Thank you for your kind attention.

  Fourteenth European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
                              ESSLLI-2002
                   August 4-17, 2002, Trento, Italy

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


                 CALL FOR COURSE and WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
                 --------------------------------------


The main focus of the European Summer Schools in Logic, Language and
Information is on the interface between linguistics, logic and
computation. Foundational, introductory and advanced courses together
with workshops cover a wide variety of topics within the three areas
of interest: Language and Computation, Language and Logic, and Logic
and Computation.

Previous summer schools have been highly successful, attracting up to
500 students from Europe and elsewhere. The school has developed into
an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and
researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
Language and Information. ESSLLI-2002 is organised under the auspices
of the European Association for Logic, Language and Information
(FoLLI).

The ESSLLI-2002 Programme Committee invites proposals for foundational,
introductory, and advanced courses, and for workshops for the 14th annual
Summer School on a wide range of topics in the following fields:

    LANGUAGE & COMPUTATION    LANGUAGE & LOGIC    LOGIC & COMPUTATION

In addition to courses and workshops there will be a Student Session.  A Call
for Papers for the Student Session will be distributed separately.


PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposals should be submitted through a web form located
at  <http://www.folli.uva.nl/Esslli/2002/submission.html>

All proposals should be submitted no later than July 22, 2001.
Authors of proposals will be notified of the committee's decision no
later than September 17, 2001. Proposers should follow the guidelines
below while preparing their submissions; proposals that deviate can
not be considered.


GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION: Anyone interested in lecturing or organising a
workshop during ESSLLI-2002, please read the following information carefully.

ALL COURSES: Courses are taught by 1 or max. 2 lecturers. They typically
consist of five sessions (a one-week course) or ten sessions (a two-week
course). Each session lasts 90 minutes.

Timetable for Course Proposal Submission:

   Jul 22, 2001: Proposal Submission Deadline
   Sep 17, 2001: Notification
   Nov 15, 2001: Deadline for receipt of title, abstract, lecturer(s)
                 information, course description and prerequisites
   Jun  1, 2002: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready course material

FOUNDATIONAL COURSES: These are really elementary courses not assuming any
background knowledge. They are intended for people to get acquainted with the
problems and techniques of areas new to them. Ideally, they should allow
researchers from other fields to acquire the key competences of neighbouring
disciplines, thus encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary
research community. Foundational courses may presuppose some experience with
scientific methods in general, so as to be able to concentrate on the issues
that are germane to the area of the course.

INTRODUCTORY COURSES: Introductory courses are central to the
activities of the Summer School. They are intended to equip students
and young researchers with a good understanding of a field's basic
methods and techniques.  Introductory courses in, for instance,
Language and Computation, can build on some knowledge of the component
fields; e.g., an introductory course in computational linguistics
should address an audience which is familiar with the basics of
linguistics and computation.

Proposals for introductory courses should indicate the level of
the course as compared to standard texts in the area.

ADVANCED COURSES: Advanced courses should be pitched at an audience of
advanced Masters or PhD students. Proposals for advanced courses
should specify the prerequisites in some detail.

WORKSHOPS: The aim of the workshops is to provide a forum for advanced
Ph.D. students and other researchers to present and discuss their
work. A workshop has a theme. At most one organiser is paid. The
organisers should be specialists in the theme of the workshop and give
a general introduction in the first session. They are also
responsible for the programme of the workshop, i.e., for finding
speakers.

Each workshop organiser will be responsible for producing a Call for
Papers for the workshop by November 15, 2001. The call must make it
clear that the workshop is open to all members of the LLI community.
It should also note that all workshop contributors must register for
the Summer School.

A workshop consists of five sessions (a one-week workshop) or ten
sessions (a two-week workshop).  Sessions are normally 90 minutes.

Timetable for Workshop Proposal Submissions

   Jul 22, 2001: Proposal Submission Deadline
   Sep 15, 2001: Notification
   Nov 15, 2001: Deadline for receipt of Call for Papers
   Dec  1, 2001: Send out Call for Papers
   Mar 15, 2002: Deadline for Papers (suggested)
   May  1, 2002: Notification of Workshop Contributors (suggested)
   May 15, 2002: Deadline for Provisional Workshop Programme
   Jun  1, 2002: Deadline for receipt of camera-ready copy of Workshop
                 notes
   Jun  1, 2002: Deadline for Final Workshop Programme


FORMAT FOR PROPOSALS: 
The web-based form for submitting course and workshop proposals is accessible
at <http://www.folli.uva.nl/Esslli/2002/submission.html>. You will be required
to submit the following information:

   * Name (name(s) of proposed lecturer(s)/organiser)

   * Address (contact addresses of proposed lecturer(s)/organiser;
     where possible, please include phone and fax numbers)

   * Title (title of proposed course/workshop)

   * Type (is this a workshop, a foundational course, an introductory
     course, or an advanced course?)

   * Section (does your proposal fit in Language & Computation,
     Language & Logic or Logic & Computation? name only one)

   * Description (describe the proposed contents in at most 150 words)

   * External funding (will you be able to find external funding to
     help fund your travel and accommodation expenses? if so, how?)

   * Further particulars (any further information that is required by
     the above guidelines should be included here)


FINANCIAL ASPECTS: Prospective lecturers and workshop organisers
should be aware that all teaching and organising at the summer schools
is done on a voluntary basis in order to keep the participants fees as
low as possible. Lecturers and organisers are not paid for their
contribution, but are reimbursed for travel and accommodation.  Please
note the following: In case a course is to be taught by two lecturers,
a lump sum is paid to cover travel and accommodation expenses.  The
splitting of the sum is up to the lecturers. However, please note
that the organisers highly appreciate it if, whenever possible,
lecturers and workshop organisers find alternative funding to cover
travel and accommodation expenses.

Workshop speakers are required to register for the Summer School;
however, workshop speakers will be able to register at a reduced rate
to be determined by the Organising Committee.

Finally, it should be stressed that while proposals from all over the
world are welcomed, the Summer School can in general guarantee only to
reimburse travel costs for travel from destinations within Europe to
Trento.  Exceptions will be made depending on the financial situation.

Abstract Stone Duality is a reaxiomatisation of general topology that
is intended to unify it with recursion theory and translate topological
constructions into executable programs.  In a sense, it turns denotational
semantics on its head: from topology (not just domain theory) to programs.
The underlying idea is Pare's theorem, that the category of "frames" is
both dual to and monadic over the category of "spaces".

The leading concrete examples are
 * the category of locally compact locales and
 * any elementary topos,
so - unlike existing programming languages and formal type theories -
there are "subtypes",  which can be carved out by means of something
like the axiom of comprehension in set theory.

Unfortunately the subject is not yet in a state where I can give an
introduction suitable for either topologists or computer scientists:
I am still building basic categorical structure on the central
hypothesis, and familiarity with Beck's theorem that characterises
monadic adjunction is essential at this stage.

This is just an interim progress report for those that already know
a little about this work.   Links to the published and draft papers are
at	http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/ASD
or	http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/TaylorP

In particular, the paper that I presented at CT2000 in Como,
        Non-Artin Gluing in Recursion Theory and
        Lifting in Abstract Stone Duality
recently came back from the referees and has now been revised.

If you have any comments on this paper, please tell me now so that
they can be incorporated in the revised version.

It contains a counterexample to show that the Artin comma square for
recovering the topology on a space from the topologies of an open subspace
and its closed complement does not work for the analogous lattices of
recursively enumerable subsets of N, considered as Godel numbers for
terminating and non-terminating programs.

However, it analyses the gluing problem a little further, and shows that
the modular law for lattices plays an important part.   On this is built
the construction of the partial map classifier in abstract Stone duality.

The paper follows and relies heavily on
        Geometric and Higher Order Logic in Abstract Stone Duality,
which was published in Theory and Applications of Categories in Dec 2000.

For the past few months I have been working on (the category theory and)
a lambda calculus for the monadic principle that underlies ASD.  This was
presented at the APPSEM workshop in Darmstadt in March.   I was hoping
to have it in a releasable state by now, but, as usual, the paper grew
much too big, so I split it in two, so it lost its narrative structure.
I hope to be able to release a draft of that later in the summer.

The main job for the summer is to get working a prototype compiler that
I started writing last summer, to translate from my comprehension-like
lambda calculus into pure PROLOG.   The reason for choosing PROLOG is 
that its semantics is (amongst existing programming languages) closest
to the semantic ideas in ASD.

Propositions as [Types]

Steve Awodey , Andrej Bauer


Abstract:
Image factorizations in regular categories are stable under
pullbacks, so they model a natural modal operator in dependent type
theory. This unary type constructor [A] has turned up previously
in a syntactic form as a way of erasing computational content, and
formalizing a notion of proof irrelevance. Indeed, semantically,
the notion of a support is sometimes used as surrogate
proposition asserting inhabitation of an indexed family.

We give rules for bracket types in dependent type theory and provide
complete semantics using regular categories. We show that dependent
type theory with the unit type, strong extensional equality types,
strong dependent sums, and bracket types is the internal type theory
of regular categories, in the same way that the usual dependent type
theory with dependent sums and products is the internal type theory
of locally cartesian closed categories.

We also show how to interpret first-order logic in type theory with
brackets, and we make use of the translation to compare type theory
with logic. Specifically, we show that the propositions-as-types
interpretation is complete with respect to a certain fragment of
intuitionistic first-order logic. As a consequence, a modified
double-negation translation into type theory (without bracket types)
is complete for all of classical first-order logic.

THEME
The workshop Methods for Modalities' (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing proof tools and reasoning methods for
modal logic broadly conceived, including description logic, hybrid logics,
feature logic, temporal logic, etc.
 
SPECIAL FEATURES
To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will be centered
around a number of long presentations by leading researchers; these
presentations aim to provide both the general background and inside
information in a number of key areas.  To complement these, we are inviting
submissions of short, focussed presentations aimed at highlighting new                      
developments, and submissions of system demonstrations.  M4M-2 is the second
installment of this bi-anual workshop series.
 
SUBMISSIONS
We invite two kinds of submissions: research papers on proof tools and
reasoning methods for modal logic as well as their applications; and system
descriptions.  Research papers need not be original; they can be up to 10
A4 size pages, and system descriptions can be up to 4 A4 size pages.
System descriptions should focus on actual implementations, explaining
system architecture issues and specific implementation techniques.  Every
system description should be accompanied by a system demo at M4M.  The
primary means of submission will be electronic, in PostScript format.
Submissions should be sent to m4m@science.uva.nl.
 
PROGRAM COMMITTEE
The program committee for M4M consists of
  Carlos Areces (ILLC, The Netherlands),
  Stephane Demri (LSV, ENS de Cachan and Lab. LEIBNIZ, France),
  Joseph Halpern (Cornell University, USA),

Two Postdoc Positions in the Computational and Applied Logic Group
------------------------------------------------------------------

Institute for Logic, Language and Computation
Universiteit van Amsterdam


The Computational and Applied Logic Group at the University of Amsterdam is
searching for highly motivated candidates with a PhD in computer science,
computational linguistics, or a related discipline, for two postdoc
positions, one in each of the following research areas:

 o computational logic (with an emphasis on implementation and evaluation
   of automated reasoning systems)

 o natural language processing (with an emphasis on logic-based approaches
   to information retrieval tasks such as question-answering, navigation, 
   and summarization)

Applicants should have a demonstrated capacity or potential to conduct
research in computational logic and/or natural language processing. 
Desirable criteria for both positions are: relevant industrial experience;
a record of project-based work; ability to supervise and inspire PhD
students.

These positions are funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific
Research and the University of Amsterdam, as part of the `Pionier' project
`Computing with Meaning.'  This is an interdisciplinary project aimed at
identifying and using meaningful information in natural language texts. 
The project will experiment with computational logic architectures that can
handle linguistic information structures at various levels of detail; this
involves new systems of flexible logics and algorithms, suitably combined. 
The project has a generous equipment and travel budget.  Please consult
http://www.science.uva.nl/~mdr/Projects/ComputingwithMeaning/ for more
information about the project.

Both positions are renewable for up to four years.  While both positions
are research positions, candidates are expected to play an active role in
supervising PhD students.  In addition, candidates may be asked to assist
with courses related to their research areas.  The salary will be between
5416 Guilders and 7128 Guilders, gross per month.  Knowledge of Dutch is
not a prerequisite, and candidates can be of any nationality.  The starting
date should be between September 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002.

Anyone interested in these positions is invited to contact Maarten de Rijke
at mdr@science.uva.nl.  Applicants should submit a full resume including a
list of publications, a statement of research interests, and the names and
email addresses of at least three references to the same address by July
15, 2001.

Research interests within the Computational and Applied Logic group range
from automated reasoning, constraint programming, satisfability checking,
and formal verification to digital libraries, information retrieval,
computational semantics, and knowledge engineering.  The group is strongly
internationally oriented, and currently consists of 15 people; it is
expected to grow substantially over the next year.  Further details on the
group can be found at http://www.science.uva.nl/~mdr/CALG/.

                GENERIC PROGRAMMING
                      
   http://www.generic-programming.nl/wcgp/cfp.html

         Organised in conjunction with MPC'02

                July  8 - July 13, 2002

                 Dagstuhl, Germany


                  CALL FOR PAPERS

Generic programming is about making programs more 
adaptable by making them more general. Generic 
programs often embody non-traditional kinds of 
polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from 
them by suitably instantiating their parameters. 
In contrast with normal programs, the parameters 
of a generic programs are often quite rich in 
structure. For example they may be other programs, 
types or type constructors, class hierarchies, or 
even programming paradigms. 

Generic programming techniques have always been of 
interest, both to practitioners and to theoreticians, 
but only recently have generic programming 
techniques become a specific focus of research in 
the functional and object-oriented programming 
language communities. This working conference will 
bring together leading researchers in generic 
programming from around the world, and feature 
papers capturing the state of the art in this 
important emerging area. 

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical 
as well as practical, of generic programming, 
aspect-oriented programming, polytypic programming, 
adaptive object-oriented programming, generic 
components, and so on. 


                    SUBMISSION

Understanding these Cost Accounting and Management Reporting
techniques requires intelligent effort, rather than a degree in
mathematical logic from Cambridge. This is much more applied common
sense than accounting wizardry.

Yes, but what about a degree in mathematical logic from *Oxford*?

I doubt if one should ever try to explain such a thing, but apparently
when I quoted one John Quinton that there were matters that require

  ...intelligent effort, rather than a degree in mathematical logic
  from Cambridge

with my comment "Take that, Martin Hyland" Robert was moved to ask:

  Yes, but what about a degree in mathematical logic from *Oxford*?
  (Unless you were referring to Martin's students ...)

What I had in mind can be confirmed from the list of members of
Cambridge's maths department:

  www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/site2000/Staff/Staff_List.html

Martin's subject is listed as "Logic" (Peter's is "Topos Theory" --
and no one lists "Category Theory"). There are two others whose
subject is listed as "Logic" but both are described as postdocs. This
unique status of Martin must thus be born in mind by any who eschews
intelligent effort in favor of a degree in mathematical logic from
Cambridge.

Dear colleagues,

My PhD thesis "Call-By-Push-Value" is available at

http://cs-people.bu.edu/pbl/papers/thesisqmwphd.ps.gz

The call-by-push-value paradigm is based to a large extent on the
theory of adjunctions.  Part 3 of the thesis explains this
connection, so I hope it will be of especial interest to category theorists.

Call-By-Push-Value
PhD thesis, Queen Mary, University of London, March 2001

Abstract

Call-by-push-value (CBPV) is a new programming language paradigm,
based on the slogan ``a value is, a computation does''.  We claim that
CBPV provides the semantic primitives from which the call-by-value and
call-by-name paradigms are built.   The primary goal of the thesis is
to present the evidence for this claim, which is found in a remarkably
wide range of semantics: from operational semantics, in big-step form
and in machine form, to denotational models using domains, possible
worlds, continuations and games. 

In the first part of the thesis, we come to CBPV and its equational
theory by looking critically at the call-by-value and call-by-name
paradigms in the presence of general computational effects.  We give a
Felleisen/Friedman-style CK-machine semantics, which explains how CBPV
can be understood in terms of push/pop instructions. 

In the second part we give simple CBPV models for printing,
divergence, global store, errors, erratic choice and control effects,
as well as for various combinations of these effects.  We develop the
store model into a possible world model for cell generation, and
(following Steele) we develop the control model into a ``jumping
implementation'' using a continuation language called
Jump-With-Argument (JWA). 

We present a pointer game model for CBPV, in the style of Hyland and
Ong. We see that the game concepts of questioning and answering
correspond to the CBPV concepts of forcing and producing respectively.
We observe that this game semantics  is closely related to the jumping
implementation.

In the third part of the thesis, we study the categorical semantics
for the CBPV equational theory.  We present and compare 3 approaches: 
\begin{itemize}
\item models using \emph{strong monads}, in the style of Moggi;
\item models using \emph{value/producer structures}, in the style of Power
  and Robinson;
\item models using (strong) adjunctions.
\end{itemize}
All the concrete models in the thesis are seen to be adjunction models.

I regret to inform you that Bob Gordon died last weekend.
He had been diagonosed with cancer, a tumor on the aortic arch
which pressed on the lungs and trachea. He was in an excellent
cancer hospital near Philadelphia.

The chemo and radiation had been producing some improvement.
Up to last Saturday he was stable though very weak. Saturday
morning his blood pressure went up and his heart weakened.
Intensive care was able to stabilize him then suddenly his heart quit.

There is a memorial service Sunday July 1 at the Gordon home. If
you would like me to convey sympathy or relevant anecdotes to his wife
and daughters, just let me know.

                         GENERAL INFORMATION

TACS2001 will be held on the campus of Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.
The invited talks and contributed talks will be presented at the Aoba
Memorial Building, Faculty of Engineering located on the Aoba Hill about
3 km west of downtown Sendai. The welcome reception and banquet will be
held at Sendai Tokyu Hotel, located in downtown Sendai.
The TACS2001 proceedings will be available as a volume of Lecture Notes
in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, at the time of the conference.

Sendai is the largest city in the northern part of Honshu Island of Japan,
with a population of about a million. The city is known in Japan as the
"City of Trees". It is 350 km north of Tokyo and about 2 hours away by
the Tohoku Bullet Train (Tohoku Shinkansen). Sendai is a modern, safe city
with a moderate climate blessed by four distinct seansons. At the end of
October the weather would be mostly sunny with temperature ranging from
5 C (41 F) to 15 C (59 F), and it will be the time of beautiful autumnal 
tints.

Conference registration is open to the public. Reservations for the Japanese
dinner party (October 31st) will be limited.

Transportation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conference participants arriving at the new Tokyo International (Narita)
Airport are advised to take the JR Narita Express train from Narita
Airport to Tokyo Station. Then take the Yamabiko super express train of
Tohoku Shinkansen (Tohoku Bullet Train) from Tokyo to Sendai. Making
reservation at Narita Station for the Yamabiko is strongly recommended.
Those arriving at the new Osaka International (Kansai) Airport can fly
to Sendai Airport, and take Limousine Bus service to Sendai Station.
Alternatively, you can take a local train from the Kansai Airport to
JR Shin Osaka Station, then take the Tokaido Shinkansen from JR Shin
Osaka Station to JR Tokyo Station and change at Tokyo Station to Tohoku
Shinkansen.
Some details on transportation will be available at the TACS2001 web page.
Note: 
(1) No flight service is available from Narita to Sendai Airport, since 
    the train service is superior. There is another train service from
    Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo (Ueno) by Skyliner of the Keisei-Narita 
    Line. At Ueno you can take the Yamabiko superexpress of Tohoku Shinkansen
    to Sendai, but you have to walk about 10 min from Keisei Ueno Station to
    JR Ueno Station to take Tohoku Shinkansen.
(2) If you are going to travel in Japan by JR lines before/after the 
    TACS2001 symposium, it will be convenient and economical to get a 
    JR PASS before your departure. Contact your travel agent for more 
    information on JR PASS (Japan Rail Pass).

Dear Jim

Yes, I would like you to convey my sympathy to Muriel and the rest of 
Bob Gordon's family at the memorial service.  I did not know Bob had 
a serious illness so this comes as a very sad surprise.

My relationship with Bob was a very happy and enjoyable one. John 
Power introduced me to him and we started what turned out to be a 
huge project which would never have reached completion without Bob's 
original contribution, attention to detail, and organization of the 
typing.  It was his idea to submit it to Memoirs.  I am proud to have 
my name on that paper.

My family and I often recall the fantastic hospitality of the Gordon 
family when we visited Pennsylvania. We stayed in their house, were 
guests of honour at a great party, and our children liked each other.

Another happy time was the MSRI conference in San Francisco.  Bob and 
I stayed in his ex-brother-in-law's beautiful apartment overlooking 
Fisherman's Wharf and the Bay.  Bob rented a car and drove a group of 
us around the Napa Valley and surrounds.

Bob was always very generous and too often down played his own 
ability.  We were happy when Bob came to Australia.  He seemed to 
like Sydney.  Brian Day enjoyed talking with Bob on all kinds of 
topics (not just mathematics).  Brian also sends his condolences.

I know that Bob had many health problems to suffer during his life 
and I was amazed how he rose above them to concentrate on 
mathematics.  I know also that he had not made contact for quite some 
time but I expected to hear eventually what mathematics he had been 
thinking about.  But that is not to be.

Ross

Hello Cat Community,
 
      I have been reading some of Prof. Pratt's papers on Chu spaces. I am
just trying to understand Topos. Both seem to generalize the notion of
topological spaces. Is there any relationship beteween Chu spaces and
Topoi?
 
Regards,
 
Bill Halchin
