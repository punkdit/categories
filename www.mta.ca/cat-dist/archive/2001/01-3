Title : The branching nerve of HDA and the Kan condition

Abstract : We have already seen that in reasonable situations,
i.e. when the path $\omega$-category associated to a higher
dimensional automata (HDA) is an $\omega$-groupoid, only the globular
nerve satisfies the Kan condition. Indeed for the branching and
merging nerves, this condition generally does not hold. This drawback
is overcome here by introducing two new nerves (the left and right
globular nerves) satisfying the Kan condition in any reasonable
situation and having conjecturally the same simplicial homology as the
branching and merging nerves respectively for any $\omega$-category
freely generated by a cubical set.

Second Announcement: Conference on Algebraic Topological Methods
                     in Computer Science

Department of Mathematics
Stanford University

July 30 - August 3, 2001

The application of algebraic topological methods in areas related to
Computer Science is an emerging field that is of interest to both pure
and applied mathematical scientists. The aim of this conference is to
describe recent advances, and define the fundamental open problems in
the field through a mixture of expository and technical
lectures. There will be twenty-one main lectures, on a variety of
topics in the area.  

This meeting has been funded by grants from Hewlett-Packard and the
National Science Foundation.

The following mathematical scientists have agreed to speak:

John Baez (Math, UC Riverside)
Marshall Bern (Xerox PARC)
Anders Bjorner (Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm)
Tamal Dey (CS, Ohio State)
Herbert Edelsbrunner (CS, Duke)
David Eppstein (CS, UC Irvine)
Michael Freedman (Microsoft)
Philippe Gaucher (CNRS, Strasbourg)
Eric Goubault (Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, France)
Jean Goubault-Larrecq (ENS Cachan)
Marco Grandis (Dip. di Mat., Genova)
Jeremy Gunawardena (HP BRIMS)
John Harer (Math, Duke)
Joel Hass (Math, UC Davis)
Maurice Herlihy (CS, Brown)
Reinhard Laubenbacher (Math, NMSU)
Laszlo Lovasz (Microsoft)
Vaughan Pratt (CS, Stanford)
Christian Reidys (Los Alamos National Lab)
Bernd Sturmfels (Math, UC Berkeley)
Noson Yanofsky (CS, Brooklyn College)

The organizers for this meeting are:

Gunnar Carlsson, gunnar@math.stanford.edu
Rick Jardine, jardine@uwo.ca

We ask that all participants register for the meeting.  The latest
information and all registration forms are available at the Stanford
Conference Web Site (http://math.stanford.edu/atmcs/index.htm).

A limited amount of time at the meeting will be devoted to short talks
by conference participants. If you would like to give a short
presentation, please send an abstract to gunnar@math.stanford.edu.

There will be a volume of proceedings for the conference, to appear in
the journal "Homology, Homotopy and Applications", with Gunnar
Carlsson as senior editor. Submissions for this volume should be set
in LATEX and should be sent to gunnar@math.stanford.edu, to arrive by
Friday, August 17. We are interested in expository papers on
particular areas of application of topology, as well as research
papers.

There will be housing for conference participants on the Stanford
campus, at the rate of about 50.00 US per night for single
accomodation: a reservation form is available at the Stanford
Conference Web Site. There are also several hotels in the area - see
the Stanford site for a list.

Limited financial support may be available for travel and housing:
please make your request when registering.

Dear all,
I submitted the following paper a few months ago,

Title: ``Applying enriched categories to quasi-uniform spaces''

Abstract: The represention of complete metric spaces
of \cite{Law73} by enrichments is extented to
quasi-uniform spaces. Moreover quasi-uniformly continuous maps
are described as enriched functors. The quasi-uniform space
completion is also viewed as a Cauchy-completion.
Super monoidal functors  are introduced to obtain these results.
A 2-category of enrichments over different bases is defined.
In this general context the Cauchy-completion is still a
universal construction.

Law73 is here the paper of F.W.Lawvere:
``Metric spaces, generalized logic and closed categories''

It is accessible on the site
http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk/research/publications
as the 6th research report of the year 2000.

All the best.
Vincent Schmitt

                                CALL FOR PAPERS
                                 SPECIAL ISSUE
                       JOURNAL OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING:
                DEPENDENT TYPE THEORY MEETS PROGRAMMING PRACTICE

Modern programming languages rely on advanced type systems that detect
errors at compile-time. While the benefits of type systems have long been
recognized, there are some areas where the standard systems in programming
languages are not expressive enough. Language designers usually trade
expressiveness for decidability of the type system. Some interesting
programs will always be rejected (despite their semantical soundness) or
be assigned uninformative types.

There are several remedies to this situation. Dependent type systems,
which allow the formation of types that explicitly depend on other types
or values, are one of the most promising approaches. These systems are
well-investigated from a theoretical point of view by logicians and type
theorists. For example, dependent types are used in proof assistants to
implement various logics and there are sophisticated proof editors for
developing programs in a dependently typed language.

To the present day, the impact of these developments on practical
programming has been small, partially because of the level of
sophistication of these systems and of their type checkers. Only recently,
there have been efforts to integrate dependent systems into intermediate
languages in compilers and programming languages. Additional uses have
been identified in high-profile applications such as mobile code security,
where terms of a dependently typed lambda calculus to encode safety
proofs.

A special issue of the Journal of Functional Programming will be devoted
to the interplay between dependent type theory and programming practice.
We welcome technical contributions in the field, as well as position
papers that:
 - make researchers in programming languages aware of new developments
   and research directions on the theory side;
 - point out to theorists practical uses of advanced type systems and
   urge them to address theoretical problems arising in emerging
   applications. 

Authors who are concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are welcome
to contact the guest editors. Manuscripts should be unpublished works and
not submitted elsewhere. Revised and enhanced versions of papers published
in conference proceedings that have not appeared in archival journals are
eligible for submission. All submissions will be reviewed according to the
usual standards of scholarship and originality.

Submissions should be sent to Gilles Barthe (Gilles.Barthe@inria.fr), with
a copy to Nasreen Ahmad (nasreen@dcs.gla.ac.uk). Submitted articles should
be sent in postscript format preferably gzipped and uuencoded. In
addition, please send, as plain text, title, abstract, and contact
information.

The submission deadline is December 1st, 2001.

	International Workshop on Concurrency and Coordination
	======================================================

			 Lipari Island, Italy
			    6-8 July 2001

           A workshop associated to the 13th Lipari School

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aims and Scope

 During the last few years, the role of global computing, and 
 in particular of web applications, has become more and more
 widespread. The emerging programming paradigms require on the 
 one hand mechanisms to support mobility of code and computations, 
 and effective infrastructures to support coordination and control 
 of dynamically loaded software modules. On the other hand, an
 abstract semantic framework to formalize the model of computation 
 of internet applications is clearly needed. Such a semantic framework
 may provide the formal basis to discuss and motivate controversial
 design/implementation issues and to state and certify properties in 
 a rigorous way.

 Similar aims have been pursued by two Esprit working groups, which
 recently terminated their activity: CONFER-2 (CONcurrency and Functions:  
 Evaluation and Reduction <http://para.inria.fr/confer/>) led by 
 Jean-Jacques Lévy (Inria Roquencourt), with technical assistance of Lone
 Leth and Bent Thomsen (ICL, London); and COORDINA (From COORDINAtion 
 models to applications, <http://malvasia.di.fct.unl.pt/activity/coordina/>),
 led by Antonio Porto (DI-FCT/UNL, Lisboa).

 The goal of the workshop is to review the large range of results
 achieved by the two working groups and to set the stage for future
 scientific advances and collaboration. However contributions and
 participation are encouraged by all those interested in the mentioned
 topics. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location

 The workshop is associated to the 13th Lipari School for Computer
 Science Researchers, Lipari, July 1-14, 2001. The Lipari School 
 (<http://lipari.dmi.unict.it/Lipari/index.asp>) is a well established
 initiative attended every year by about 60 PhD students and researchers 
 from Italy, Europe and the US. In 2001 the school will be dedicated to 
 the foundations of Wide Area Network Programming and will consist of 
 lectures by Martin Abadi, Bell Labs Research, Palo Alto; Luca Cardelli, 
 Microsoft Research, Cambridge, UK; Paolo Ciancarini, University of
 Bologna; Peter Lee, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh; Doug Lea,
 State University of New York at Oswego; Michael I. Schwartzbach,
 University of Aarhus; and Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems, Burlington,
 Mass. and Harvard University.  

 Lipari is the largest island of the Eolie Archipelago, located north
 of Sicily, well known for its volcanic activities. It has sceneries
 of incomparable beauty and contrasting character. It can be easily
 reached from Milazzo, Palermo, Naples, Messina and Reggio Calabria by
 ferry or hydrofoil (50 minutes from Milazzo).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program

 The program of the workshop will include invited talks by the
 lecturers of the Lipari School (and possibly others), and talks
 presenting submitted contributions.

Professor Roger Apéry (1916-1994) spent all of his career at the
University of Caen. He is best known for advocating  constructive
mathematics against bourkakism and for proving that zeta(3) is irrational.
What is less known is his enthusiasm about category theory, as  an
alternative to set theory (to some extent). According to his son, he became
a lover of CT at a seminar in Montréal in 1964. If any reader of this list
remembers talking with Apéry at that time or later, or knows of any idea he
expressed on CT, I would be grateful about any bit of information. Thank
you!

                              CALL FOR PAPERS
 Semantics, Applications and Implementation of Program Generation (SAIG'01)
        PLI Workshop, September 6th, 2001.  (Deadline:  May 20, 2001)

                http://www.cs.yale.edu/~taha/saig/cfp01.html

Program generation has the prospect of being an integral part of a
wide range of software development processes.  Many recent studies
investigate different aspects of program generation systems, including
their semantics, their applications, and their implementation.
Existing theories and systems address both high-level (source)
language and low-level (machine) language generation.  A number of
programming languages now supports program generation and
manipulation, with different goals, implementation techniques, and
targeted at different applications. The goal of this workshop is to
provide a meeting place for researchers and practitioners interested
in this research area, and in program generation in general.

Scope: The workshop solicits submissions related to theoretical and
practical models and tools for building program generators systems,
Examples include:

   * Semantics, type systems,  and implementations for multi-stage
     languages.
   * Run-time specialization systems:  e.g. compilers, operating systems.
   * High-level program generation (applications, foundations,
     environments).
   * Program synthesis from high-level specifications.
   * Symbolic computation, linking and explicit substitution, in-lining and
     macros.

Reports on applications of these techniques to real-world problems are
especially encouraged, as are submissions that relate ideas and
concepts from several of these topics, or bridge the gap between
theory and practice.  The program committee is happy to advise on the
appropriateness of a particular subject.

Format: The one-day workshop will contain slots for technical papers
(30 minutes) and position papers (20 minutes. Both times include
discussion.) In addition, there will be one hour allocated for open
discussions at the end of the workshop.  Proceedings will be published
as an LNCS volume.

Invited Speakers:

   * Krzysztof Czarnecki, University of Ilmenau and Daimler Chrysler
   * Tim Sheard, Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology
   * Mitch Wand, Northeastern University

Submission Details: Authors are invited to submit papers of at most
5000 words (excluding figures), in postscript format (letter or A4),
using the electronic submission form by May 20th, 2001.  This deadline
is not extensible. Both position and technical papers are welcome.
Please indicate at time of submission. Position papers are expected to
describe ongoing work, future directions, and/or survey previous
results.  Technical papers are expected to contain novel results.  All
papers will be reviewed by the program committee for the above
mentioned criteria, in addition to correctness and clarity.  Authors
will be notified of acceptance by July 17th, 2001.  Final version of

How do cross-category results relate to category theory?  In particular, is
there a *deeper* theory than category theory which crosses different
categories?   I ask this question because I have been following the function
p1(x,y) = 1 + y - x and its n-dimensional generalization pn(x,y) = 1 + y -
Sn/n where Sn = x1 + x2 + ... + xn  and where 0 < = y < = xi < = 1 for i =
1, 2, ..., n (although the inequality can be changed to just y < = xi in
certain categories) not only across categories but branches of mathematics
including probability, mathematical logic, mathematical physics, geometry,
number theory, algebra including especially ring and module theory,
geometric nonlinear functional analysis, etc.   Even p1 alone appears to
have remarkable importance across these fields and others (including
functional differential and integrodifferential equations).  The category
object changes, but the function p1 and the inequality remains, and there is
even a non-function (which can be made into a function with suitable
restrictions) of type y/x --> 1 + y - x which often splits branches of
mathematics down the middle with one branch using y/x and the other using 1
+ y - x in a generalization of the notion of phase differences (solid versus
liquid versus gas versus superfluid versus superconduction types generalized
to rare versus common/frequent events, highly influencing or influenced
versus low influencing/influenced events, zero curvature versus non-zero
curvature events or objects, anomalous versus non-anomalous conditions,
etc.).

I'm looking for a reference for two notions related to symmetric monoidal 
categories and symmetric monoidal functors.

Assume that A and B are symmetric monoidal categories, and denote the 
product operation on both by \tensor.  Assume that L is a lax (symmetric) 
monoidal functor from A to B.

Here are the two closely related notions:

1.  Let G be a functor from A to B for which there is a natural transformation

L(a_1) \tensor G(a_2) -> G(a_1 tensor a_2)

for all a_1, a_2 in A making the obvious diagrams commute (one an 
associativity diagram and the other a unit diagram).  One can think of L as 
acting on G, or of G as "modular" over L  (I'm working in the abelian 
category context, so it is natural to think in terms of rings and modules).

2.  Now suppose that L has a right adjoint R and G has a left adjoint 
F.  Also assume that L is strictly (or is it strongly) monoidal, and that R 
has the "dual" monoidal structure.  There seems to be a natural common 
source for an action of L on G and of R on F.  This source is a natural 
isomorphism of the form

F(L(a) \tensor b) \iso a \tensor F(b)

for all a in A and b in B.  If the appropriate diagrams commute, then it is 
easy to derive the actions of L on G and R on F  from this 
isomorphism.  What intrigues me most about this situation is the way in 
which the adjunctions go in the opposite direction.

These two situations appear throughout some stuff in algebraic topology 
that I am working on right now.  Is there a reference in the literature 
where these notions are discussed?

Here is a standard (somewhat degenerate) example of this situation.  Let h: 
S -> T be a homomorphism of commutative rings.  There is an associated 
pullback functor from T-Mod to S-mod which plays the role of the functors R 
and F above.  This functor has both left adjoint (playing the role of L) 
and right adjoint (playing the role of G).  The pullback functor R is lax 
monoidal, and its left adjoint L is strict  monoidal.  The functor L acts 
on G, and R = F acts on F via the lax monoidal structure on R.  In the 
examples that show up in my topological research, R and F are distinct, and 
neither F nor G have monoidal structures.

Thanks,
Gaunce Lewis

Under certain circumstances, a perfectly legitimate procedure in
diagram.tex will cause a useless warning to appear on the screen when used
in latex2e, although not in latex2.09.  The way to prevent this rather
annoying warning is to add the line
\let\@picture@warn\relax
to diagram.tex, AFTER the line near the top that says
\makeatletter

I had been living with this warning for a couple years and I want to thank
Richard Wood for having given me the clue necessary to track it down.

                                 hosted by

             Concur 2001, , and Aalborg University

Venue: Aalborg University, Denmark

Conference dates:
CONCUR: August 21-24, 2001
GETCO:    August 25, 2001



                               Call for papers

Scope of the workshop

The main mathematical disciplines that have been used in computer science
are discrete mathematics (especially, graph theory and ordered structures),
logics (mostly proof theory for all kinds of logics, classical,
intuitionistic, modal etc.) and category theory (cartesian closed
categories, topoi etc.). General Topology has also been used for instance in
denotational semantics, with relations to ordered structures in particular.

Recently, ideas and notions from mainstream "geometric" topology and
algebraic topology have entered the scene in Concurrency Theory and
Distributed Systems Theory (some of them based on older ideas). They have
been applied in particular to problems dealing with coordination of
multi-processor and distributed systems (see the  historical note ). Among
those are techniques borrowed from algebraic and geometric topology:
Simplicial techniques have led to new theoretical bounds for coordination
problems. Higher dimensional automata have been modelled as cubical
complexes with a partial order reflecting the time flows, and their homotopy
properties allow to reason about a system's global behaviour.

The first workshop on the subject  Geometric and Topological Methods in
Concurrency Theory  has been held in Aalborg, Denmark, in June 1999. GETCO
2000 was organised as a workshop affiliated with CONCUR 2000 at Penn State
University.The recent volumes 10 of Math. Struct. in Comp. Science and 39,
issue 2, of Electr. Notes Theor. Comp. Science have been devoted to this
area.

The 3rd workshop in this series will be organised as a satellite to CONCUR
2001 at Aalborg University (Aug.21 - Aug.24). It aims at bringing together
researchers from both the mathematical (geometry, topology, algebraic
topology etc.) and computer scientific side (concurrency theorists,
semanticians, researchers in distributed systems etc.) with an active
interest in these or related developments.

Topics include (but are not limited to) Semantics, Concurrency Theory,
Model-checking, Abstract Interpretation, Fault-tolerant Protocols for
Distributed Systems, Geometrical/Topological models, Applications of
algebraic topology, Category theory etc.

Paper submission

The deadline for submission to the workshop is May 20, 2001 (midnight).
Submissions may be of two forms:

   * Short abstracts: up to 4 pages, in format A4, typeset 11 points
   * Full papers: up to 12 pages, in format A4, typeset 11 points (excluding

LAST CALL FOR PAPERS
FORMAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

Organized by Y. Velinov, University of Natal

Invited Session of the SCI'2001 Conference
The Fifth World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and
Informatics,
Orlando, Florida, USA, July 22--25, 2001
Professor Nagib Callaos, General Chair

URL http://www.iiis.org/sci
-------------------------

TOPICS OF THE INVITED SESSION:

A rich variety of formal models are currently in use in 
every field of the contemporary information technology. 
New formal structures are frequently introduced to model 
real world situations. Old, sometimes almost forgotten, 
are revived finding new applications.
The aim of the present session is, 
instead of concentrating on a particular approach, 
to get together researchers from different areas 
to share ideas, approaches and their practical efficiency.

The scope of the session includes set-theoretical, 
relational, logical or categorical structures. 
More specific areas like Petri nets or Automata theory 
are also welcome.


SUBMISSION  
------------
Potential authors are asked to inform for their intention 
to submit a paper as soon as possible by sending a short

The logic of linear functors
 by Richard Blute, J.R.B. Cockett, and R.A.G. Seely

It has been commonplace to base logics and type theories on
categorical doctrines; with this paper we propose a more general
paradigm, suggesting that logics and type theories may be based on
functorial doctrines.  This paradigm is very general - in particular,
it subsumes all of usual categorical logic and type theory as
degenerate cases.  So as to be able to make precise claims, we
illustrate this idea with a special case, developing the logic of
linear functors with sufficient detail to see that this one doctrine
is general enough to deal with basic linear modal logic and with the
Abrusci-Ruet mixed non-commutative linear logic.  We emphasise the
case where the logic is based on a single functor, but it will be
clear that one could also base it on a family of functors, which would
allow one to deal with process logic as considered by Hennessy and
Milner.

The paper's abstract is given in full below.

The logic of linear functors
  by Richard Blute, J.R.B. Cockett, and R.A.G. Seely

ABSTRACT:

This paper describes a family of logics whose categorical semantics is
based on functors with structure rather than on categories with
structure.  This allows the consideration of logics which contain
possibly distinct logical subsystems whose interactions are mediated
by functorial mappings. For example, within one unified framework, we
shall be able to handle logics as diverse as modal logic, ordinary
linear logic, and the "noncommutative logic" of Abrusci and Ruet, a
variant of linear logic which has both commutative and noncommutative
connectives.

Although this paper will not consider in depth the categorical basis
of this approach to logic, preferring instead to emphasize the
syntactic novelties that it generates in the logic, we shall focus on
the particular case when the logics are based on a linear functor, to
give a definite presentation of these ideas.  However, it will be
clear that this approach to logic has considerable generality.

There have been several individual attempts to develop logics with
distinct but related subsystems of connectives, such as the
Abrusci--Ruet noncommutative logic and the bunch logic of O'Hearn and
Pym; generally these are presented in terms of "bunching" the formulas
in the sequents of the logics via different "punctuation".  The
present functor logic, by contrast, uses a system of "formula blocks",
which represent the functorial action and which give finer control
over what logical features may be displayed.  By displaying a family
of functor logics, we illustrate how different logical systems can be
developed along these lines, logics which are primarily distinguished
by the degree to which they permit nesting of formula blocks. Our
examples will include a basic logic where there is essentially no
nesting, a system of linear modal logic, which allows nesting, but has
only one system of connectives, and the Abrusci--Ruet logic, where
nesting is virtually unrestricted and there are two subsystems of
connectives.  We finish by showing how to translate between the
``bunch'' style of logic and our ``formula block'' or functor logic
using the Abrusci--Ruet noncommutative logic as an example.

I would like to have a large pool of examples of adjoint functors in as many
different fields of mathematics as possible.  I am looking for the "nicest",
in whatever sense you can think of this expression (e.g. unexpected, their
existence is equivalent to a classical theorem, etc), cases in various
fields.

References or examples anyone?  (Besides the standard ones found in Mac
Lane, etc.)

Thank you, 
Jean-Pierre Marquis
