Dear David,

The underlying idea is a very broad one, namely to look for limits of
internal diagrams. You will find these described in Johnstone's "Topos
Theory" and (I think - I haven't got it to hand) Mac Lane and Moerdijk.

Suppose, working in a suitable category S (let's say a topos), you have an
internal category C. Then you can define a notion of internal diagram over
C (C-shaped diagram of S-objects) and they are the objects of an external
category S^C, another topos.

If D is another internal category in S and F: C -> D is a functor, then
there is a functor F^*: S^D -> S^C defined using pullbacks in S and it has
both right and left adjoints. In fact it defines an essential (if I
remember the right word) geometric morphism from S^C to S^D.

Now consider the situation when D is the terminal category, one object and
one morphism. S^D is just S. The the right and left adjoints of F^*
calculate internal limits and colimits of internal diagrams. This is easy
to see, since F^*(X) is just the constant diagram, X everywhere, and a
morphism (natural transformation) between an internal diagram D and F^*(X)
is just a cone or cocone over D from or to X. The adjunctions then express
exactly the universal properties of limits and colimits.

I was describing situations where C was a discrete category, so the
internal limit is an internal product.

I also considered the question of whether the construction of the internal
limit was geometric - preserved under inverse image functors of geometric
morphisms. I have written about this kind of question in my own work, for
instance "Topical Categories of Domains". (See my website,
http://mcs.open.ac.uk/sjv22 .) Geometricity in general rules out the use of
exponentiation in the topos, but exponentiation Y^X is geometric if X is
finite with decidable equality (Johnstone and Wraith, ??"Algebraic theories
in a topos"). My proposal is that the record type construction should be
seen as a solution to the problem of internal products, but that it relies
on finite decidability of the set of field names - hence it's related to
geometricity of the internal product.

In a different direction, note that internal products make sense in
categories other than toposes, even if they don't always exist. For
instance, if f: X -> Y is a continuous map of spaces, then the internal
product, if it exists, is a space of continuous sections of f. I bet that's
explored somewhere in the literature, but I don't know where.

Best regards,

Steve.

I'd like to thank the contributors to what has turned out to be
another Category Theory vs Set Theory thread -- Steve Vickers, Michael
Barr, Colin McLarty, Charles Wells, Zinovy Diskin, and John Duskin --
especially Steve and Zinovy for their lengthy replies.  My original
post was, in a way, meant to be a step in the direction of ending such
CT vs ST debates, but there still seems to be some interest in
establishing "oppositions" between the two theories.  Here is my
attempt to frame the debate and to respond to some comments of the
contributors in the process.  I apologize for the length of this post.

Zinovy Diskin observes that the debate involves "methodologically
quite different problems whose merging under the same title CTvsST may
be misleading", echoing the earlier statement by Bill Lawvere that
"[s]o much confusion has been accumulated that an opposition of the
form `set-theoretical versus non-set-theoretical' has at least seven
wholly distinct meanings."  I quite agree, and this was exactly the
point of the end of my original post:

    And, finally, shouldn't "better" really be "better for what"?  In
    other words, aren't the two communities really just arguing past
    one another, like people arguing over types of automobile?  What
    really is the issue here?

Colin McLarty has asked for clarification of these questions.  My
point was simply that it is pointless to claim that one theory or
subject or approach is better than another without specifying what it
is supposed to be better *for*.  (Is a pick-up truck better than a
2-seater sports-car?  Is a Mercedes Benz better than a BMW?)  Here is
a list of eight possible uses to which CT and ST may be put:

1.  Offering an axiomatic foundation upon which all of mathematics may
    be developed, with a view towards

    a.  establishing or making manifest its consistency
    b.  providing a standard of rigor
    c.  providing a common framework for the cooperation between
        different mathematical domains

2.  Acting as a language in which certain mathematical ideas can be
    expressed, so that

    a.  better use can be made of them (in applying them to specific
        instances, seeing connections between them, highlighting their 
        more important features, etc.)
    b.  they can be communicated more effectively to other
        mathematicians
    c.  they better please our aesthetic sense

3.  Providing models for specific phenomena (physical or
    computational), with a view towards

    a.  informally illuminating their properties and connections
    b.  predicting the outcomes of experiments involving them

All of these uses are more or less concrete enough that comparisons
between CT and ST could be undertaken empirically using these criteria
(although some of them, for example 2a and 2c, are clearly more
subjective than the others).  My expectation is that CT and ST would
each be "winners" on some non-trivial subset of the criteria.

In addition to these eight uses for CT and ST, there is another
important role that these theories play, namely, as formal theories of
pre-mathematical concepts -- "collection" and "membership" in the case
of ST, and "transformation" and "comparison" in the case of CT.  From
this point of view, I am left somewhat mystified by Lawvere's
reference to the "totally arbitrary `singleton' operation of Peano
with the resulting chains of mathematically spurious rigidified
membership".  Whatever its other "faults", ST seems to me to be a
pretty accurate theory of "recursive collections" (or "classes" or
"containers"), that is, collections of collections of ....  Indeed, we
can easily play with real containers of various sizes, and put them
inside each other in various ways, and ST can be seen to be an
accurate description of these configurations.  The part of our
conceptual apparatus that deals with container relations such as these
is real and deserves to be modeled by a formal theory, and I find it
hard to criticize ST on its appropriateness for this role.  (Of
course, ST is also about infinite collections, and its role there is
more open to debate.)

Continuing from this point of view, one feature of ST that I find
especially interesting is that, although it is ostensibly a theory of
"recursive collections", it nevertheless is quite successful, without
any substantial additions, in many other roles -- see the list of
eight uses above.  It is an interesting philosophical and practical
question to ask why this might be so, but one can hardly dispute this
success.  Thus, I also find it difficult to appreciate claims (such as
Lawvere's) that set theory is "ill-suited for mathematics"; doesn't a
simple comparison of the mathematical achievements before and after
its "arithmetization" by set theory suggest otherwise?

Turning to more specific topics, several respondents to my original
post realized that my discussion of Cartesian products was a bit
muddled, and that my suggestion of an "unordered product" was
incoherent.  Colin McLarty answered my question about the technical
work involved in dealing with the a/the distinction by suggesting that
"nothing is involved if we introduce a product operator".  However, if
we have a category with many non-trivial isomorphisms, then the task
of introducing a product operator does involve something: making some
arbitrary choices.  Without getting into the details, I just wanted to
ask whether such choices themselves added a kind of "spurious element"
to the construction at least qualitatively similar to those in ST
referred to by Lawvere.

Steven Vickers nicely spelled out in more detail some of the ideas
behind Lawvere's "cohesive and variable sets".  However, I didn't mean
to suggest in my post that I didn't appreciate the difference in
approach (for example, I did my PhD thesis on frame theory, an
algebraic underpinning for point-free topology).  Rather, I fail to
understand the point of criticizing ST for presenting a *particular*
view of cohesion.  Isn't it interesting that a surprisingly general and
mathematically fruitful definition of cohesion/nearness among a set of
points can be given in terms of just a single element of the double
powerset of those points?  The many achievements of "point-set" or
"general" topology would suggest so.  Now, I certainly agree that this
view of cohesion may not be the best one for some, or even many,
applications (which is what initially led to my interest in frame
theory), but why does that have to turn into a criticism of the
set-theoretic framework?  We don't criticize the rectangular
representation of complex numbers because we also have a polar
representation.

Vickers also makes the point that set-theoretic topology "does not
generalize well to situations where you want to vary the set theory,"
and also mentions situations where it is fruitful to vary the
underlying logic as well.  These topics are among my favorites in all
of mathematics, and I have been a proselytizer for these ideas in
other forums, but the reaction of set theorists is understandable:
varying the ST and logic makes it harder to relate what you are doing
in the different "universes".  A mathematician wanting to take
advantage of a shift in ST and logic is faced with the problem of
(re-)interpreting the results in the original framework.  The extra
overhead involved in moving between universes (not to mention the
large "start-up costs" involved in learning the framework in the first
place) is seldom ever justified by the advantages that ones gains,
however real they can be.  This is a very practical matter, involving
mathematicians' choice of where to invest their time, and, again, I
don't see what is to be gained by criticizing them for their choices.

CONCLUSION:  PLURALISM AND A CHALLENGE

To sum up, I think that any debate on CT vs ST should take place in
the context of a concrete and particular use of the two theories,
where it is possible to investigate, more or less empirically, the
advantages and disadvantages of each.  In any other context, the
debate reduces to a battle over personal preference, artistic sense,
working habits, and other such subjective issues, and is unlikely to
get anywhere.

Second, I think we ought to foster a more pluralistic viewpoint.  Each
theory has its strengths and weaknesses, and we should choose the most
appropriate tool for whatever job it at hand.  If someone contends
that there is a significant difference in appropriateness between two
approaches, then, for this contention to be taken seriously, the
difference has to be made clear and concrete for the "worker in the
field".  I would make the same point to computer scientists who are
involved in the endless "Language Wars" over which programming
language is the "best".

And finally, I would like to offer a challenge (or challenges).  For
those mathematicians and computer scientists enamored with the vistas
opened up by category theory, and topos theory in particular (and I
count myself as among these),

- Can we build computer-implemented formal systems that make it easier
  to navigate through several universes, work simultaneously with
  several logics, and help with re-interpretation when necessary?

- Can we write books that help reduce the start-up costs involved in
  "outsiders" learning and using the framework?

- Can we discuss in public places and in detail the importance of the
  topos-theoretic or category-theoretic outlook in obtaining our
  mathematical results?

- And can we all the while hold off on our criticism of other
  approaches and instead let the results speak for themselves?

Call for Papers

Second International Workshop on Graph Transformation
and Visual Modeling Techniques
<http://www.elet.polimi.it/GT-VMT>

Crete, Greece,
July 12 and 13, 2001

A Satellite Event of ICALP'2001
<http://www.cti.gr/engl_v/news/sc_conf/icalp.html>

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE WORKSHOP

The growing success of visual modeling techniques in the design and
development of complex applications is justified by many reasons.  For
example, the use of visual representations simplifies the
communication both among developers and between developers and their
customers; furthermore, visual techniques provide a high-level, yet
precise language which allows to express and reason about concepts at
their natural level of abstraction; finally, the availability of
modern computational resources (like graphical workstations) provides
easier access to tools supporting such techniques.
However, despite the wide-spread usage of visual modeling techniques,
compared to textual languages there is a lack of well-understood (and
integrated) methodologies for defining their semantics.  For example,
there exists no equivalent approach to operational semantics in the
SOS style, nor is there a general method for defining denotational
semantics.  The same applies to concepts like type systems, deductive
proof methods, etc. for visual modeling techniques.
On the other hand there are a number of individual approaches which
exploit formalisms like Graph Transformation Systems, Process Algebra,
Abstract State Machines, etc. to solve certain aspects of the overall
problem.
The workshop aims at bringing together scientists and researchers
interested in discussing formal methodologies for the definition of
syntax and semantics of visual modeling techniques. In particular
contributions exploring the use of the theory of Graph Grammars and
Graph Transformation Systems to this aim are welcome, as well as
approaches based on other formalisms.
Preferably, the contributions should be methodological in nature,
rather than focusing on particular technical aspects.

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to 5 (five) A4
pages.  The contributions should report about ongoing research in the
area of graph transformation and visual modeling techniques,
especially on the syntax and semantics of visual languages according
to the scope and objectives of the workshop. Contributions exploring
the use of Graph Grammars and Graph Transformation Systems are
particularly welcome, as well as papers which cover several aspects or
integrate different formalisms for the definition of visual modeling
techniques. Position papers and contributions making methodological
statements are strongly encouraged. Submissions should be sent
preferably in postscript format to the address baresi@elet.polimi.it
(Luciano Baresi) before the submission deadline. In the case
electronic submission is not possible, three copies should be sent to
the address:

	Todd Wilson suggested there are many different issues in
contrasting CT to ST. He admits he was partly "mystified" by Lawvere's
earlier post, which said the same thing and actually advanced the
discussion by specifically laying out several different threads. And when
I asked Wilson which issues he wanted to discuss he mistook my meaning,
and thought I was asking him to explain how there are different issues.
This kind of repeatedly starting from scratch is not helpful, though it is
regrettably common in the "debate" over ST and CT.

	Finally though, he gets to some specifics.

	Work going back to Osius and Mitchell and others in the 1970s shows that
CT can accomplish 1a and 1b in pretty much the same way that ST does, if
you want to do it that way. Perhaps the best comprehensive citation now is
to Johnstone TOPOS THEORY and its chapter on topos theory and set theory.
See also Mac Lane and Moerdijk SHEAVES IN GEOMETRY AND LOGIC and their
chapter on topoi and logic. Simpson on the FOM list likes to call this
"slavish imitation" of set theory, thus agreeing that CT can do what ST
does. It can also accomplish 1a and 1b in its own terms, if you like that.  

	1c is definitively answered in mathematical practice. Category
theory has been the leading common framework for linking domains for half
a century. ST is not a candidate on any practical level.

	Again, in practice, category theory is the leading framework for 2a and
2b. No one proposes using ZF on that level. 

	As to 2c, anyone may vote as they please. 

	I make no citations on these because they are perfectly obvious. If any
result can "speak for itself" surely the categorical methods in topology,
geometry, analysis, and arithmetic, can for themselves.


>3.  Providing models for specific phenomena (physical or
>    computational), with a view towards

	As to physical phenomena, the principled foundations of math don't
seem to bear very directly on them as practiced today. Who could seriously
argue that Hawking's or Witten's work is "actually" founded on ZF versus
the category of sets? On the level of methods, people do propose
categorical methods for quantum gravity, quantum groups, and so on. I
don't believe anyone is seriously exploring ZF for the same role.

	People who believe practice would advance better, if foundations were
brought closer to practice so that the whole structure of math was more
harmonious, will probably favor category theory. 

	Computational phenomena bring us back to the issue that started the
thread. Here I think serious discussion is warrented because there is a lot
to know. I'm no computer expert but I will reply to:

	
>Turning to more specific topics, several respondents to my original

	No. Look at it this way: If I say in a computer program "x=0" am I
making an "arbitrary choice" of how to represent 0 by a set? We know that
in CT or ST there are alternative representations of 0. But the computer
does not occupy itself with those. It has its internal representation of 0
as a data value (perhaps several) and uses that (or, one of them).

	Similarly, suppose I have a product operator. That is actually,
one binary operator on objects _x_ with object values, and two binary
operators on objects p0_,_ and p1_,_ with arrow values. When implementing
these I give the machine a way of internally representing these as data
values, and the machine uses those representations.

	Of course, in implementing the categorical product, as in implementing
integer arithmetic or anything else, the programmer makes many more or less
"arbitrary" choices of details of how the machine will handle them. That
has nothing to do with non-identity isomorphisms, and nothing to do with ST
versus CT.

	In principle, or for foundations, the issue here is the difference
between choices and operators. There is a huge logical literature on it
and it is uncontroversial.

best, Colin

Every reader of this post probably knows that the algebras for the monad
on sets induced by the self-adjoint contravariant powerset functor are
the complete atomic Boolean algebras, with maps preserving all infima
and all suprema as morphisms.  I know how to prove this without much
trouble, but I have not been able to find a proof of this fact, or even
a good reference to such a proof, in the literature available to me
at my present location (which is essentially what I have at home).
If you know such a reference, please e-mail it to me at owyler@nqi.net.
Related question.  The functor on sets which assigns to every set X the
set of increasing subsets of PX is the functor part of a monad, with
completely distributive complete lattices as algebras.  Again, I have
a proof but no references.

I am teaching a course out of Bell's book "A Primer of Infinitesimal
Analysis" to senior mathmajors at my liberal arts college.  It is making
a nice capstone, since it lets them look at the material they started
college with (claculus) from a completely different viewpoint (that of
synthetic differential geometry).  It also lets me teach some of a topos
theoretic view on mathematics.  I am left with some questions in my own
mind about what one can and cannot do in a smoth world.  Specifically,
	1.  The usual inverse function theorem uses monotonicity to guarantee
the existence of an inverse function, a monotonicity obtained from the
mean value theorem.  It seems unlikely to me that the mean value theorem
holds in synthetic differential geometry, so how does one guarantee the
existence of an inverse for a function with strictly positive
derivative?
	2.  In a smooth world must the image of a closed interval be a closed
interval?   Can one characterize closed intervals without knowing what
their endpoints are purported to be?  (Since closed intervals are
microstable you can't actually know those endpoints uniquely).
	3.  How do you justify the leap from stationary points to maxima and
minima?

Have any of the other readers of this list tried teaching a course out
of this book?

The key issues raised by Bill Lawvere may be further specified if we  
try to make explicit the different "philosophical projects" which  
underlie the Set Theory vs Category Theory debate.

ST is "newtonian": it proposes a fixed-absolute universe (ZF or  
alike) where all of present (and future!) mathematics should be  
embedded (described).  Its perspective is (basically) "laplacian":  
given the (current) axioms of set-theory (or arithmetic) we can  
prove/decide/predict all future states of affairs (theorems of  
mathematics).

CT originates from a rather different perspective.  Riemann first  
proposed to found mathematics (geometry) on key regularities of the  
world to be turned into conceptual invariants, as "hypothesis" about  
the structure of physical space (connectivity, continuity, isotropy  
... ; H. Weyl added symmetries to this).  Then, one had to single out  
the "invariant preserving transformations" (Kleine, Clifford,  
Poincare' ...).
The objects, as structural invariants, and the morphisms of CT, as
transformations (including isomorphisms ...; functors; natural
transformations ...), came out directly from this tradition; that  
is, CT followed the riemannian project who had replaced the absolute
axioms/universe of euclidean geometry by the "relativizable" notions  
of invariant and transformation (as founding manifolds).
In CT, the unity of mathematics, not as an absolute pre-fixed  
universe, but as an open world of ongoing new concepts and  
structures, is constantly re-constructed, by (interpretation)  
functors, which relate new categories to old ones (moreover, natural  
transformations (adjunctions ...) help to correlate these functors).

Clearly, Newton and Laplace were immense scientific personalities,  
but ...,  since then, many things have happened.  In Physics, of  
course, but also within ... ST or in the proof-theory of Arithmetic,  
such as the independence theorems or the remarquable results on the  
"unremovability of machinery", which, even if within ST, force us  
outside the "rational mechanics" of PA ....

More on this may be found in a two pages note of mine on "Laplace (vs
Hilbert)" (or, reflections on rational mechanics and  
incompleteness), an item inserted in the Dictionary at the end of JY  
Girard's paper "Locus Solum" (MSCS, n. 11.3, to appear) and in a  
paper on "The reasonable effectiveness of Mathematics ..." (both  
downloadable from my web page).

This is of course folklore. I believe
there is a proof (essentially) in
Johnstone's Stone Spaces.

I have written out a proof for students in
chapter 1 of my "Basic Category Theory"

isn't the correspondence of sets and caBa the "discrete part" of the
stone duality?

the other monad prof wyler mentions appears, i think, in e. manes'
thesis, and in his 1976 book "algebraic theories", perhaps as a step
towards deriving the monad for compact hausdorff spaces.

all the best,

For an "upgraded" version of the correspondence 
see the newly appeared

M.Bunge, J. Funk, M. Jibladze, T. Streicher
"Distribution Algebras and Duality"
Advances in Mathematics 156, 133-155 (2000)

This is done for a bounded topos E--->S, replacing 
S = Coc_S(S,S) by Dist(E) = Coc_S(E,S) and caBA(S)
by "distribution algebras". Identifying E with S gives 
the correspondence in question. For just that one, it 
may be worthwhile to consult directly Mikkelsen's 
thesis combined with Pare's Theorem.

Hello,
all introductions to field and Galois theory I've found are written in a
"classical" way, i.e. making not much use of categorical notions. A lot of
computation is done where someone who is "categorical minded" has the
feeling that the results could be established in a more comprehensible and
clear way by category theory. -- Does somebody have a reference to a short
and good introduction to field and Galois theory from a categorical
viewpoint?

Thanks

Please pass on to interested students. Apologies for multiple copies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

New PhD Positions  (DEADLINE 1 March 2001! See "How to apply" below.)

		   Department of Computing Science,
     Chalmers University of Technology & University of Gothenburg
				Sweden

The Department has about 70 researchers, half being faculty members
and half PhD students. Our focus is on programming logic, type theory,
functional programming, formal methods, distributed and concurrent
systems, security, algorithms, bioinformatics, human computer
interaction, and computational linguistics, but research is not
restricted to these topics.  For more information, see
http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research.

PhD positions are for 5 years. There is no tuition fee. A PhD position
is a regular job with social benefits; the salary amounts currently to
about 16700 SEK per month in the first year (the exact amount depends
on teaching duties, usually 20% of your time).

Knowledge of Swedish is not a prerequisite for application. English is
our working language for research. Both Swedish and English are used
in undergraduate courses.  Half of our researchers and PhD students
are native Swedes; the rest come from more than 20 different
countries.

Applicants must have a very good undergraduate degree in Computing
Science or in a related subject with a strong Computing Science
component. They must also have a strong interest in doing research.

You may also apply if you have not yet completed your degree, but
expect to do so by September 2001. You are also invited to apply for
our new International Master's Programme in Dependable Computer
Systems, which can help you to obtain the necessary qualification (see
http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Education/dcs/)

The School especially welcomes female applicants.


How to apply
------------

First, immediately register your intention to apply using the
electronic application form on the WWW via

  http://www.md.chalmers.se/Jobs/PhD/phd-01-en.thtml

The full application should contain

  1 A letter of application, listing specific research interests
  2 A curriculum vitae
  3 Attested copies of degrees and other certificates
  4 Copies of relevant work, for example dissertations or
    articles, that you have authored or co-authored
  5 A description of:
    a previous teaching experience, documented, if any
    b previous PhD studies, also in other subjects.
      State financial support for these, if any
    c previous work experience
  6 Letters of recommendation from your teachers or employers

If you have financial support of your own (industry job, grant, etc.),
please state this fact clearly. It will increase your chances to be
accepted considerably, because you need not compete for the limited
number of fully financed positions.

Send your application (paper mail) to

  Section for Mathematics and Computer Science
  Chalmers University of Technology
  412 96 Gothenburg
  Sweden

I confess to some confusion as to what Charles is insisting is inevitable
here.  A binary product in C is a limit of a diagram 1+1->C (1+1 the
two-object discrete category), and 1+1 has two automorphisms.  This much
and its mathematical consequences are surely inevitable.

But woven into Charles' argument is what Bill has called the "totally
arbitrary singleton operation of Peano."  It appears implicitly at the
beginning when Charles names the projections, and then (after an indirect
reference to the automorphisms of the binary product) more explicitly
when he collects the names as a set.

Surely anyone insisting on names like 1 and 2 or red and blue for the
projections of binary product is backsliding into the ZFvN tarpit of
spurious rigidified membership.  If this backsliding really is inevitable
as Charles seems to be saying, how does one reconcile this with Bill's
view of "rigidified membership" as "mathematically spurious"?

Must mathematics accept the spurious, in this or any other case?

Dear all,


Let C be an omega-category (strict, globular).

Let U be the forgetful functor from strict globular omega-categories
to globular sets. And let F be its left adjoint.

Let us suppose that we are considering an equivalence relation R on UC
(the underlying globular set of C) such that the source and target
maps pass to the quotient : i.e. one can deal with the quotient globular
set UC/R.

The canonical morphism of globular sets UC --> UC/R induces a morphism
of omega-categories F(UC) --> F(UC/R) by functoriality of F.

Consider the following push-out in the category of omega-categories :


F(UC) ----->  F(UC/R)
  |               |
  |               |
  |               |
  v               v
  C   --------->  D


The morphism F(UC)-->C (the counit of the adjonction) is surjective on
the underlying sets.

The morphism F(UC)-->F(UC/R) is generally not surjective on the
underlying sets : because by taking the quotient by R, one may add
composites in F(UC/R) which do not exist in F(UC).

However the intuition tells (me) that the morphism F(UC/R)-->D is
surjective on the underlying sets : this morphism only adds in F(UC/R)
the calculation rules of C : this is precisely what I want by
introducing D. But I cannot see why with a rigorous mathematical
argument.


Thanks in advance. pg.

To all category theorists,

I'm looking for a reference to the definition of a normal categorical 
subgroup, i.e. the right kind of subgroupoid of a categorical group for
taking the quotient. I know the definition, but I have no reference. Does
anyone know a published origin of the definition?

Best wishes,

Marco Mackaay

As I said in an earlier post, the whole thing is a figment of the linear
way we write (and speak, for that matter).  Products are over unordered
sets and any ordering is purely irrelevant.

let me mention the book

   Galois theories
   Francis Borceux & George Janelidze
   Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics, volume 72
   Cambridge University Press (2001), 341 pages
   ISBN 0 521 80309 8 

which will be available from February 20.

This is probably not an as "short" introduction as Tobias wants ... 
and I let you decide if it is a "good" one.

References at the end of the book, in particular to various papers of
George Janelidze on a categorical approach of Galois theory, will provide
alternative answers to Tobias'question.

Here is the table of contents of the book.

   1. Classical Galois theory
   2. Galois theory of Grothendieck
   3. Infinitary Galois theory
   4. Categorical Galois theory of commutative rings
   5. Categorical Galois theorem and factorization systems
   6. Covering maps
   7. Non-galoisian Galois theory

	Charles Wells and Steve Vickers both made the point that, for
example, in a record of type (height in inches age, in years) you have to
be able to identify the height entry, and the age entry, but you do not
have to identify either one as the "first" entry or the "second". Yet, as
Charles points out, the usual ways of identifying the two entries all
carry a culturally-canonical ordering--as we say "one, two" usually in
that order and "left, right" most often in that order. As he puts it:

>>However, in practice the index set is {0,1}, {1,2} or {x,y} (the latter in
>>analytic geometry).  All of these are canonically totally ordered in our
>>culture, so inevitably binary products do have an order in practice.

	Then Vaughan Pratt weighs in, in his rhinocerean way. (For those
who do not read FOM, or at least Ionesco, Vaughan had a terrific post on
FOM about categorists as kind of rhinoceros, and by the end he began
transforming into one.)

	I think Charles is not tarred by this pit. 

	The Peano/ZFvN idea is to say that, given 0 and 1, and some one
among all the two-element sets is actually the set {0,1}.

	Charles is merely saying that when we pick a two element set, and
name its elements, we tend to use names with specific (helpful or
spurious) connotations.

	The naming here is "local", a choice of how to talk about two objects we
assme we have. It involves no idea that the two element set has any
objective features making it the set of 0 and 1.

best, Colin

This Festschrift, or celebratory publication, honours an important
contributor to the fundamentals of computer science. Robin Milner, to
whom this volume is dedicated, has been a cornerstone of the
theoretical computer science world for the past three decades or so.

The book begins with an enlightening biography of Milner's
professional achievements that helps set the context for the rest of
the book. As is usual in a Festschrift, the volume mainly consists of
contributions from Milner's immediate colleagues and those working in
the same field on related topics. All the contributions are of
international stature and are largely technical in nature. Thus, this
book provides an important in-depth snapshot of the work of some of
the best minds in the area of theoretical computer science.

Milner had an excellent education. He won a scholarship to King's
College, Cambridge, in 1952 - the same college where Alan Turing had
won a similar scholarship about 20 years earlier. He studied
mathematics, the underpinning of computer science, and, for a while,
Cambridge's "moral sciences", or philosophy in normal parlance.

The early professional experiences of Milner were as a schoolteacher
and as a programmer at Ferranti, both useful grounding for a computer
science academic. He then worked at City University in London, Swansea
University, Stanford University in California and, from 1973, at
Edinburgh University, where his most important work was undertaken.

In 1995 he moved back to Cambridge, where he now heads the Computer
Laboratory. He has received the highest awards, including a fellowship
of the Royal Society in 1988 and the annual ACM Turing Award in 1991,
computer science's nearest equivalent to a Nobel prize.

Milner's contributions to theoretical computer science have been in
the areas of programming language semantics using domain theory,
computer-assisted theorem proving, the programming language ML
(standing for "Metalanguage") and, perhaps most significantly,
concurrency. His early influences included Christopher Strachey
(leader of the Programming Research Group at Oxford and originator of
denotational semantics), Rod Burstall (also at Edinburgh), Peter
Landin (a free-spirit pioneer of computing), Dana Scott (who worked
with Strachey at Oxford on the foundations of programming languages)
and John McCarthy (of artificial intelligence fame at Stanford, who
coined the term AI).

At Stanford, Milner developed the Stanford LCF (logic of computable
functions) while working within McCarthy's AI group, based on a logic
developed by Scott using a typed l-calculus (the essential underlying
theoretical basis for the functional programming paradigm). This
subsequently developed into Edinburgh LCF, with its own programming
language Edinburgh ML that was designed to aid in the discovery and
construction of proofs, an inspired idea for the time. This became
Standard ML that, because of its carefully designed and well-
understood formal semantics, has proved to be an excellent, more
general programming language.

If the above efforts are not enough, probably Milner's most important
contribution concerns the formal underpinning for concurrency,
starting with his calculus of communicating systems (CCS). This
introduced the notion of bisimulation for comparing the equivalence of
processes. Although an influential concept, some researchers have
considered bisimulation too restrictive in practice (for example, in
strong bisimulation, both processes must execute the same number of
steps) and Milner himself proposed a more forgiving weak bisimulation.

CCS has always been somewhat in competition with Tony Hoare's
communicating sequential processes (CSP) in terms of influencing the
field, with the usual camps of researchers expert in each. However,
more recently Milner has developed his ideas further with a newer
p-calculus for mobile computing that is increasingly important in
practical terms with the development of the internet. Milner remains
active in this area.

Milner's influence on his field is significant, as the contributions
in this book attest. Many subsequent theorem provers produced by other
researchers have been inspired by Milner's original LCF, including the
development of Cambridge LCF, and the related HOL (higher order logic)
by Mike Gordon, as well as Isabelle by his colleague Larry Paulson
(both contributors to this book). ML has also been developed further
and other theorem-proving systems like Coq, Lego and NuPrl owe much to
Milner's ideas.

Proof, Language and Interaction is divided into five sections:
"Semantic foundations", "Programming logic", "Programming languages"
and "Concurrency and mobility". These successfully reflect the
developing interests of Milner through his professional career.

"Semantic foundations" includes contributions on the linking of
different types of semantics. Full abstraction, a term coined by
Milner, is developed further by Samson Abramsky, a colleague at
Edinburgh who has since moved on to join the Programming Research
Group (PRG) at Oxford within the Oxford University Computing
Laboratory. Hoare, who recently moved from the PRG to join Microsoft
Research in Cambridge, is closely associated with the Computing
Laboratory there. He presents his and his colleagues' work on
deriving an operational semantics algebraically. The linking of
semantics and concurrency is also explored.

In "Programming logic", Gordon (like Milner, of Edinburgh and
Cambridge) gives a helpful and less technical historical view of the
development of the original LCF into his own important contribution to
computer science, HOL, one of the most widely used theorem provers.
Paulson, colleague at Cambridge, gives a related but much more
technical account of a fixed-point approach to induction. Robert
Constable, developer of the NuPrl theorem prover, and his colleagues
at Cornell University in the United States, present the formalisation
of automata theory.

The "Programming languages" section naturally includes work on
Milner's ML as well as a programming language based on the
p-calculus. Gerard Berry, who is based in Paris, presents a useful
introduction to the important synchronous language Esterel, whose
design was highly influenced by Milner's work on process calculi and
bisimulation.

The section on concurrency, as expected, includes developments of
Milner's CCS. The final mobility section presents advances with
respect to the p-calculus, which is where Milner's most recent
research interests and contributions lie.

All of these essays build on concepts that Milner originated or
promulgated himself, either directly or indirectly. This unifying
force helps to provide structure to the book, especially because
Milner's own work, although it is varied in application, has a
consistency in elegance of style that is a feature of work by all
top-class theoreticians.

The book finishes with a list of contributors, but does not include an
index. This would have been a useful addition for those wishing to use
it as a reference work. Some abbreviations (for example PCF, a
programming language development of LCF) are introduced without
expansion or comprehensive explanation. An index might have made some
of these omissions clear to the editors. Alternatively, or in
addition, a glossary of terms, especially those coined by Milner
himself, would have been an interesting supplement. However, these are
minor quibbles in an otherwise well-edited and presented volume.

The majority of the material is highly technical in nature and is only
suitable for those acquainted with the field. The introductory
biography is naturally approachable to a wider readership and is a
useful historical record, but its 17 pages, out of a voluminous 722 in
total, would not alone justify acquisition of the book. Ultimately,
this collection will be at home in any good computer-science library,
and this will probably be its main destination. It will also be of
interest to theoretical computer scientists wanting a book that
provides a range of invited papers all of which are of international
journal class. Most computer scientists with an interest in the
theoretical developments of the subject would be only too happy to
have this book on their shelves if they could afford it.

In 1999, as head of the Computer Laboratory at Cambridge, Milner
officiated during the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the
early Edsac computer, developed by Maurice Wilkes and his team, which
first ran a program successfully in 1949. Indeed, in 1956, Milner
himself attended a computing course at Cambridge using the Edsac.
Wilkes was a important leader of the Cambridge University Computer
Laboratory. His expertise on the pioneering practical development of
computers counterpoints Milner's contribution in the mathematical
underpinning of computer science.

The balance of theory and practice has been a key feature of work
undertaken at Cambridge that continues under Milner's direction to
this day and is the basis for all significant computer-science
research. Milner has always ensured that his research contributions
have been relevant as well as fundamental.

This book is a fitting "thank you" from those who have benefited most
directly from Milner's insights. In turn, it should help others to
appreciate his influential contribution to theoretical computer
science.

Vaughn Pratt made some valid points about my earlier remarks on the
inevitably of binary product projections being ordered.  For the most part,
I agree with him (but see below), since my (unclearly made) point was that
it is inevitable in our current mathematical culture, not that it was
mathematically inevitable.  

However, I am stuck on one point:  Sometimes one needs to refer to one of
the projections, and that involves giving the projections names.  I
mentioned "red" and "blue" as examples of names that do not introduce a
spurious ordering. But in practice, we must occasionally give names.  This
is not only for computation, either.  For example, one sometimes needs to
assume that an n-ary operation factors through one of the projections, and
then deduce consequences from that (Peter Johnstone did something like that
in his study of varieties that are ccc's).  In the proof one must give a
name to the projection it factors through.

So I argue that naming the projections is sometimes a practical necessity,
and given current mathematical habits the names are likely to have some
intrinsic (culturally intrinsic!) ordering.  But we could use red and blue.
 Or vanilla and chocolate.

Hi.

I am also trying to catch up, perhaps belatedly, with the "spurious
ingredients" thread, but I am quite lost in some parts.

> But woven into Charles' argument is what Bill has called the "totally
> arbitrary singleton operation of Peano."

To begin embarassing myself --- I am not sure what Peano's singleton operation
is. Is it the map x|-->{x}?

If it is --- why is this operation totally arbitrary, like Bill says? In
particular, why is it more arbitrary than the successor operation in arithmetic
(which Peano used)? It comes about as a part of the initial algebra structure
on Godel's cumulative hierarchy, just like the successor comes about in NNO.
Aren't all our inductive constructions based on such operations, including the
software we are using to run this conversation?

I would really appreciate help with this.

Also, I somehow came to think of set theory as *tree representations of
abstract sets*, much like vector spaces are used for group representations. Is
this wrong? It seems to me that introducing the external, "spurious" elements
(eg vectors) is the whole point of representations. And more than that, the
essence of our thinking: Isn't every metaphor, as a deviation from the abstract
view, built of spurious elements? Isn't every novel a bunch of lies, things
that never happened, put together to tell some truth? Can we really define
cartesian product without the spurious elements?

I am sure we can, but it would be good to know more precisely how to
distinguish the spurious from the authentic elements. Otherwise, we may end up
"slinging back and forth ill-defined epithets", like i am probably doing now.

With apologies, and best wishes,
-- Dusko

OOPS! In my previous posting i've made some mixed-up and talked mainly about
notation for diagrams while the actual question is whether product  is
commutative (symmetric) operation in Sets. Below is a sketch of possible
solution.

First of all, product is a diagram operation and explicit presentation of
their syntax would be useful; so, let me present a bit of technicalities.

Let G be some base category (think of the category of graphs). The arity of
a diagram operation F (think of  products, push-outs...) is a G-morphism s:
S^in --> S with S the shape of the operation and S^in the input shape.

For example, for binary products, S is the graph    [x] <--p-- [u] --q-->
[y]
where [ ]'s denote nodes and arrows'  names are  written right on the
arrows,
S^in is the two-node discrete graph  [x]  [y],  and morphism s is its
embedding  into S.

A G-object C (think of a category)  is an F-algebra if for any diagram d:
S^in --> C there is a unique diagram  F^C(d): S-->C such that s;F^C(d) = d
(input data are preserved); below i'll write just F for F^C.

Well, categorically we normally have many isomorphic F(d)'s,  let's skip
this  for a while. And as for products of sets (ie, F is Prod, C is Sets),
by using names p and q that are already given in the shape, we really have a
canonical choice. Namely, for any d: [x]  [y] --> Sets with x.d=A, y.d=B, we
define
u.Prod(d) = { t: {p,q} -->  A \cup B |  p.t \in A, q.t \in B } with evident
p.Prod(d) and q.Prod(d).

F is called commutative on algebra C if  any isomorphism i: S^in --> S^in
has an isomorphic extension i+: S --> S with s;i+ = i;s  s.t. for any d:
S^in --> C,   F(i;d)  =  i+ ; F(d)

Now it is seen that Prod is commutative in Sets because any isomorphism i:
S^in --> S^in  has an evident required extension i+, i+(u) = u and i+ acts
on the arrows p,q, . exactly like i acts on their targets x,y,.. The
illusion of non-commutativity of products in Sets arises because of
disregarding the diagrammatic nature of the operation: isomorphism i on the
nodes in the shape acts on d but the corresponding i+ acting on the arrows
is not taken into consideration.

 A peculiarity of what was described above is that  names of items in the
shape are used in the definition of the operation. So, for example, the
following two shapes
[x] <-- weight -- [u] -- height --> [y]   and  [x] <-- red -- [u] -
blue -->[y]
though isomorphic yet different and determine the two different product
operations producing isomorphic yet different results from the same input.
Thus, what we usually call the product operation is  something like
operation schema parameterized by pairs of names. Then expressions like
Prod[weight:A, height:B] denote a concrete instance of the shape schema and,
simultaneously, a diagram d in Sets with
weight.codom.d = A and height.codom.d = B.

Now back to AxB vs. BxA. The writing AxB is normally unambiguous, it means
[1st:A] x [2nd:B] and  encodes
(i) the standard shape instance [x] <-- 1st -- [u] -- 2nd --> [y] and
(ii) the diagram d: [x]  [y] --> Sets,  x.d = A, y.d=B.

In contrast, the writing  BxA is really ambiguous: it may mean either
(a) [1st:B] x [2nd:A] that encodes the same standard shape instance
     [x] <-- 1st -- [u] -- 2nd --> [y] but now the diagram is x.d = B,
y.d=A;
or it may mean
(b) [2nd:A] x [1st:B] that encodes the non-standard shape instance
[x] <-- 2nd-- [u] -- 1st  --> [y] and again the diagram x.d = B, y.d=A.

It seems that  thinking naïvely-set-theoretically people tend to see in
writing BxA the case (a) and then, of course, BxA is not equal to AxB. And
thinking categorically, people tend to see in writing BxA the case (b) and
then BxA is the same as AxB. So, the problem 'ordered vs. unordered products
' is a  problem of poor notation for product operation like BxA  while the
operation itself is a *commutative*  diagram operation as defined above.
Actually it was already said in early postings but now it became more
transparent.

Finally, some speculation. It seems that parameterization of (shapes of )
operations by names, and use of these names in operation's definitions,  is
applicable to other standard categorical operations and can be considered in
a general setting. Probably,  it could be made precise by some kind of
internalization ...?

It's right of course but maybe some explanation of what is meant would be
useful.

Even if we work in naive set theory, products are defined for diagrams d:
I -> Set and thus expressions
Prod(A,B,C) or AxBxC are, strictly speaking, incorrect because we don't see
diagrams. When we use such expressions we actually use the following
convention:
(i)  the source of any  diagram is an initinal fragment of natural numbers,
I={1,2,3,...n}
(ii) the very mapping d is defined by the correspondence of the natural
ordering  I={1,2,...} and  the list of sets in the expressions above in
their reading from left to right, eg, AxBxC encodes the diagram d1=A, d2=B,
d3=C.

Quite similarly, we may use colored inks for writing AxBxC... and state
another convention:
(i)'  the source of any diagram is a set of colors, I={red, yellow,
blue,...}
(ii)' the very mapping d is defined by correspondence between semantic
meaning of these labels 'red', 'yellow', .... and colors of inks with which
symbols 'A', 'B', 'C' are written, eg, A(written in yellow) x B(in greeen) x
C(in red) encodes the diagram
d: {yellow, green, red} --> Set with yellow.d=A, green.d=B, red.d =C.
Does it mean that pdoducts are colored? :)

So, back to the "problem of ordered vs. unordered products": ordering is not
more than a notational tip for encoding diagrams having nothing to do with
the construct of product as such. In applications, where we need to deal
with semantically meaningful indexes -- elements of I, the convention of
having I={1,2,..} is irrelevant and another notational tip was invented. To
designate the product of diagram d: {red, blue}-> Set with red.d=A,
blue.d=B, we write Prod(red:A, blue:B) or  (red:A) x (blue:B) or just
[red:A, blue:B] and it's really convenient.

Thus, expression AxB denotes Prod(1:A, 2:B) while BxA denotes Prod(1:B, 2:A)
which are different just becausse these are products of the *different*
diagrams.

So, heavy use of convention (i),(ii) and the corresponding notation in
classical math may be misleading (notational peculiarity is attributed to
the notion as such) and thus, as Mike Barr wrote in his early posting, is
its disadvantage. It became an *annoying*  disadvantage when you start to
work in applications (say, relational database theory) with your old habit
to consider relations as sets of ordered tuples.

================
Actually, a similar problem we have in categorical products and other
categroical operations producing multiple items and so  we need a convention
how to name/denote them. For example, having a diagram d: I--> C, we need to
agree how to denote (name)  projections. There is no such a problem with
usual operations over sets because there is a single result and we usually
denote it by the very term built with the symbol of the operation, say, 8+3.
Let's imagine now that we have a  binary operation * on integers producing
two results: their difference and product, so that 8*3=(5,24). Of course,
the latter notation is ambiguous and actually we need to write say [1st:8] *
[2nd:3]  = [1ST: 5,  2ND:24]. Thus, a really unambiguous format for writing
arity-coarity shape of the operation * is
      [1st:_] * [2nd:_] = [1ST:_ , 2ND:_ ]
where _'s denote placeholders. Well, this notation is still using, though
inesentially, some ordering flavor and so let's suppose that the two
operands of our operation are distingusihed by some meaningful (semantic)
roles they play, say, one operand is considered to be 'principal' while the
other is 'auxiliary'; as for the two results, we may use the underlying
procedures for naming them.  Then the arity-coarity shape might be written
as
      [princ:_ ]  *  [aux:_ ] = [diff:_ , prod:_ ]
and no any ordeirng used. Note, names of the results are included in the
syntax of the operation from the very beginning and not taken on the sky.
Probably, Colin McLarty wrote about the same.
=======================

After all, it seems that in this (indeed somewhat figment) debate
(initiated, i remind, by a Todd Wilson's question about comparative pluses
and minuses of the two ways of treating products w.r.t. applications) the
actual principle difference between them, that really matters for
applications, was lost, i mean not articulated explicitly and hence lost by
the applied domains part of the audience. I will sketch it for the case of
relations  because in application we normally deal with relations rather
than products.

In ST, you first define tuples (actually, as we've seen,  mappings defined
on unordered sets) and *then* a relation is a set of tuples of the
corresponding type. In CT, you *first* define a relation as a set equipped
with a jointly monic family of outgoing mappings (that is, in fact, declare
a special predicate for the corresponding diagram of arrows with common
source) and then, if you need, define a tuple as an element of that set.

The CT-way is a really abstract specification applicable in any context
where objects of interest are organized into a category (say, we may define
what is a relation between the two database schemas). In ST-way,  we have
just a particular specification, in fact, an elementwise implementation of
the categorical specification. In sofware engineering terms, one might say
that the CT-way is object-oriented (though actually it's arrow orineted)
since relation appears as a set of objects  while the ST-way is
value-oriented since relation is just a table of values.

Also, these two ways induce the two different logics. In the CT-treatment,
relations appear as new (derived) sorts to which basic sorts of other
theories can be mapped when we deal with interpretaions of theories. In
applications (say, consider the famous ER-diagrams),  this phenomenon is not
exotics and well known under the name of 'semantic relativism' (what is an
entity -- basic sort -- for one user, may be a relationship for another
user).  In the logic naturally induced by the ST-treatment (Tarsky's
first-order structures), a theory  interpretation can map a basic relation
to a derived relation but mapping a basic sort to relation (either basic or
derived) is not legitimate. An essential difference!

I guess that the point I was trying to make in my post was missed in 
my telegraphic submission. I'll try to make what I was trying to say 
clearer.

If you take the "representable functor" definition of a product of a 
object A with an object B, you say that an object P together with an 
ordered pair of arrows (p_A:P--->A,p_B:P-->B) is a product of A with 
B if for all objects T , the mapping Hom(T,P)--->Hom(T,A)xHom(T,B), 
defined by f |---> (p_A.f,p_B.f) is a bijection. This makes it clear 
that P together with (p_A,p_B) represents the product of A with B and 
P together with (p_B,p_A) represents the product B with A and that 
these are not representations of the same functor but that there is a 
natural isomorphism of such an object with itself which "interchanges 
the two projections". Note also that this distinction remains even 
for a product of A with itself which leads a pr_1 and pr_2 notation 
for the two "projections".

Now, as with all such bijections, one can eliminate all reference to 
sets of morphisms by a "for all x there exists a unique y such 
that..." statement  which here becomes: for all ordered pairs of 
arrows of the form (x:T--->A,y:T--->B) , there exists a unique arrow 
f:T--->P, such that (p_A.x,p_B.y)=(x,y), and the  distinction made in 
in set theory between AxB and BxA," that they are not equal, but 
there is a 'canonical' bijection between them", is perfectly 
maintained entirely within category theory... or is it? The use of 
the ordered pair term "(x,y)" still appears in the replacement first 
order statement, and if the only way that one can use "ordered pair" 
is through von Neumann's clever but rather grotesque (x,y)={x,{x,y}}, 
one has to pull in "Peano's entirely spurious singletons" , as Bill 
Lawvere referred to them.

Now if the purpose of an "underlying logic" us to "codify by making 
explicit the normal habits of reasoning that all mathematicians will 
accept" and that "an object P and arrows p_A:P--->A and p_B:P--->B" 
is  equivalent to "an object P and arrows p_B:P-->B and p_A:P-->A", 
or more starkly, the logical equivalence of,"p_A and p_B"  and "p_B 
and p_A". Then there would seem to be no way that a purely first 
order category theory could make the distinctions that we teach in 
every elementary math course about the distinction between (x,y) and 
(y,x), unless we appeal to informal aspects of everyday language 
where "and" is sometimes commutative and sometimes not, and thus in 
this case rely on "everybody's having met (x,y) long before they have 
ever heard of a 'category' ".

Apparently this subtlety has surfaced before: In the beginning of 
Bourbaki's Theorie des Ensembles,\footnote{which, remember, was 
written by "working mathematicians" who did not consider themselves 
"professional logicians or professional set-theorists", and may even 
have had some contempt for them (among others) if we are to judge 
from a certain fronts piece photograph inserted by Andre Weil into 
the Fascicule de Resultats.} they introduced as "specific signs", in 
addition to those of equality and membership, another sign of weight 
2, \couple xy, ultimately written as (x,y) together with the Axiom 
(A3) :
(for all x)(for all y)(for all x')(for all y' ) (x,y)=(x',y') implies 
x=x' and y=y'. They then define "z is an ordered pair (couple)" by 
"(there exists x)(there exists y)(z=(x,y))", which then gives (x,y) 
its first and second projections because of the way that "there 
exists " is constructed (using their "\tau operator"). The existence 
of the cartesian product of the set A with the set B  then follows, 
as usual, as the set of ordered pairs,since the presence of (x,y) 
allows them to describe formal "relations" R|x,y| as properties of 
the ordered pair  z=(x,y). Only later do they observe, in an 
exercise, that the little von Neumann nest of singletons has the 
property of the axiom A3, but they  use this only to show that 
\couple xy together with A3 is relatively consistent with their other 
axioms for set theory.

  It is clear, however, that \couple xy and A3 could have been 
introduced immediately after they had done quantification and long 
before any of the axioms for \epsilon were introduced. But, after 
all, they were  trying to use their "Theory of Sets" as a foundation 
for all of mathematics, so most people have considered this whole 
business of adding  \couple xy and A3  at so fundamental a level an 
eccentric and superfluous curiosity, and it has all but been 
completely forgotten.

  My point is not to pull category theorists back into the intricacies 
of  Bourbaki 's treatment of logic, but rather to point out that the 
idea of an ordered pair has at least once before been considered a 
notion that properly belongs somewhere anterior to set theory and can 
be used in category theory without fear of the latter suffering from 
any "set-theoretic contamination". In any case, to my eyes, the use 
of "lists and addresses" with their attendant ordering seems to be 
pretty fundamental in computer science.

Amusingly, Grothendieck "pushed" representability in the forlorn hope 
that it would convince working mathematicians that they did not have 
to give up their Cantorian Paradise of " set-theory"  in order to 
make use of the unique insights provided by "category theory", but 
then had to (re-)invent "universes" when the old paradoxes of 
set-theory and the category of all sets, all groups, etc. carpingly 
resurfaced.

Bill Lawvere, in contrast, noticed that when the working axioms of 
set-theory were rephrased in purely "category-theoretic" terms, that 
they, amazingly, all became "first order" statements , thereby 
raising the question of an entirely new way to look at foundational 
questions in which the pesky membership paradoxes could not arise nor 
even be formally expressible. He, in contrast to Grothendieck, 
"pushed" the much more radical move of, effectively, "banning all use 
of Hom-sets" and thereby  made the divide crystal clear.

	Well, something *like* Peano's operation occurs in that initial algebra
structure, but that is not much to the point.

	The point is: successor did not have to wait for NNOs to be defined. It
occurs throughout arithmetic for nearly as long as we have records of
systematic thought. And it is central to all uses of arithmetic today.

	The *singleton subset* idea is also very old: A geometric condition can
define a subset of points in the plane, and perhaps a singleton subset. And
singleton subsets are all over math today for the same reason.

	It is a recent idea that given any set x there is some set {x}. Bill
traces it to Peano. It plays no role in ordinary mathematical practice, and
is unnecessary in set theory. It does not exist in categorical set theory.

	The whole point of group representations is that each group has many of

to relate these with *other* representations of the same groups. 

	Each ZF set has exactly one membership tree. Thus the "representation"
cannot do anything like what group representations do. And obviously it

	I hope no one believes that singletons, or trees, or vectors are
"spurious" per se. Some uses of the ideas are "arbitrary", and some claims
about them are "spurious".

ordering is not inevitable

naming is inevitable

how do you refer to a proyection withot naming it ?

of course naming a proyection by the object it proyects is the mother of
all evil

have you delt with actions of the symetric group, say, on polynomials on
several variables   ?
There is a related (if not the same) confusion here.

what sense has the concept of unlabeled graph ?

try to put an unlabeled graph inside a computer  ?

well, unlabeled graph has to be a quotient by an equivalent relation ...


and so on ...

you mean unordered? i would implement it as an ordered graph, with an
additional involutive map on the edges, ie

        Edges <--inv-- Edges ==dom,cod==> Nodes
        dom.inv = cod
        inv.inv = id

--- which, in a way, confirms that

isn't the "ordering" of the components of a product AxB (by the names,
colors A and B), in a similar way, "factored out" by the canonical
isomorphism with BxA? isn't coherence theory the way we can always factor
out such arbitrary annotations on objects?

(SORRY i am posting too much.)

but didn't joyal and moerdijk actually write a book about it? i think they call it
successor, but the standard model is x|-->{x}. (or did i mix it all up?)

i didn't say that set theory provides tree representations of ZF sets; ZF sets
*are* trees (or acyclic rooted graphs). i said that set theory provides tree
representation of *abstract* sets. think of lazy natural numbers, flat natural
numbers, finite chains, all of them different *and useful* representations of the
same abstract set.

> And obviously it

the words "obviously" and "practice" don't go together well. 20 years ago, it
seemed obvious that complexity theory was mostly an academic whim. nowadays, the
security infrastructure built upon it is a critical part of the engineering
practices, and the very life of the net. large cardinals may still find unexpected
applications, say in establishing the new tax policies =;0

all the best,

Can someone give a reference to an elaboration of this point of view?
Since I am not a real category theorist and have at best a weak
understanding of foundations, something written for the mainstream
mathematician would be even better.

Thanks in advance.

Dear colleagues

It is with great sadness and pain that I tell you that
Japie Vermeulen died tragically on the night of Sunday 11
February. He was on his way back from visiting family in 
Ceres, about a two-hour journey from Cape Town. He had 
taken a route through Bain's Kloof, a spectacular pass 
over the mountains between Ceres and Wellington. It was 
established that his car was overheating, the radiator was 
found to be empty and there was a hole in a water pipe. He 
had taken a container and attempted to descend a steep 
path to fetch water from a stream. He slipped and fell 
10 to 15 metres, hitting his head and fracturing his skull. 
He died instantly. His body was eventually found, after a 
search, at 5pm on Monday.

All who knew Japie will mourn a wonderful human being and a 
brilliant mind.

yours is not an answer to my question, which I shall explain now (I
thought that it needed no explanations)

by an unlabeled graph i mean the drawing of a graph, in paper, say, or a
graph buildt in space, the skeleton of a building for example. It has
vertices and edges, and everybody knows what it is. Mathematically you
could say a symetric relation on its (finete) set of vertices. But not
quite so ...

If you have n vertices, you have n! different labeling. Each labeling
gives you a different labeled graph.

The minute you have a set (in the mathematical sense) of vertices, you
have a labeling. Namely, the elements of that set are the labels!. So,
with a symetric relation (in the mathematical sense) what you got is a
labeled  graph. Not an unlabeled graph !.

And you become well aware of this fact when you want to put a concrete
unlabeled graph (say, the skeleton of a  building) inside a computer !!

REMEMBER I rise the question on unlabeled graph related to the question
that we were discussing:

INEVITABILITY OF NAMING (IN MATHEMATICS) 
 (naming is not the same as labeling ?)  

>> well, unlabeled graph has to be a quotient by an equivalent relation 
...

I said that. It seems possible. I explain now the  ...

  Given two graphs R, S (symetric relations) on a finite set X (of 
vertices), consider the natural action of the symetric group of X on the
power set of X x X. Then, R =~ S iff they are in the same orbit. The
elements of the quotient set are the unlabeled graphs.

    e.d.

	Dusko Pavlovic points out that various data types representing the natural
numbers by posets are useful. That is true but hardly related to tree
representations in set theory. (For example, these posets are generally not
"extensional" in the sense of membership trees.)                             
	
	When I remarked that the operation x|--> {x} has no role in mathematical
practice and does not exist in categorical set theory, Dusko replied:

>but didn't joyal and moerdijk actually write a book about it?

	Joyal and Moerdijk wrote a book on algebraic characterization of models of
ZF. They use an operation with formal properties like Peano's singleton. So
I have to admit the singleton operation does figure in practice, when the
"practice" is to describe ZF and related set theories. Not otherwise.

	When I said membership trees "obviously play no role in ordinary math
practice" he replied

	Membership trees are hardly the same as the study of large cardinals. The
large cardinals I know of are all described by isomorphism invariant
properties (measurable: an uncountable set k which admits a non-principle
k-complete ultrafilter). So the definitions that ZF set theorists give do
not rely on membership, they are already definitions in categorical set
theory.   

	As to "obvious", we might wish that everything about practice was obscure.
It would free up 'debate' wonderfully. But it is obvious right now that
membership trees in set theory are used only for a handful of technical
theorems in the foundations of set theory. Categorical set theorists also
use them, for equiconsistency results with ZF. 

	I don't claim to *prove* they will never have any other use. Perhaps one
day they will be central to work in PDEs. Perhaps one day (as Philip
Johnson predicts) Bible based biology will produce far greater advances
than materialist science as practiced in recent centuries. I only say such
claims are arbitrary.

Relational database theory is actually more subtle than this.  The 
extension indeed is a set of ordered n-tuples but this is linked to an 
intension specifying attribute names and types.  The extension is 
effectively indexed by names in the intension so that ordering of columns 
is immaterial.  Since the ordering of tuples in the extension is also 
immateial, the model is very flexible. The indexing is in effect from 
another level.

Cannot  such relations be better represented as pullbacks?  Limits and 
colimits then appear to emerge naturally as keys (product thereof) and 
non-keys (sums) respectively.

CT certainly appears more powerful at handling object modelling than 
ST.  But I am not sure the relational model is simply value-oriented. The 
user view is such but the underlying theory (dependencies, normalization, 
intension-extension mapping, integrity rules) is very much arrow-based and 
hence also amenable to CT.

Dear Categoricians,

I'm wondering if there has been any work  in formalizing statecharts [1]
in categorical terms. If not, do you know of an other algebraic
description of this specification language?
Also, it seems to me that the operationnal semantic STATEMATE of
Statecharts as described in [2] is very coalgebraic in nature. Did
anybody write something about this?

Thank you for any information or pointer,

Matthieu

Third international workshop on Implicit Computational Complexity-2001 (ICC'01)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   (affiliated with PADO and MFPS)

The Implicit Complexity Workshop (ICC'01) will be held on Sunday, 20
May 2001 in Aarhus as part of the joint PADO/MFPS 2000 conferences.


Topics of Interest:
-------------------

The synergy between Logic, Computational Complexity and Programming
Language Theory has gained importance and vigour in recent years,
cutting across areas such as Proof Theory, Computation Theory,
Applicative Programming, and Philosophical Logic. Several
machine-independent approaches to computational complexity have been
developed, which characterize complexity classes by conceptual
measures borrowed primarily from mathematical logic. Collectively
these approaches might be dubbed IMPLICIT COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY.

Practically, implicit computational complexity provides a framework
for a streamlined incorporation of computational complexity into areas
such as formal methods in software development, programming language
theory. In addition to research reports on theoretical advances in
implicit computational complexity, practical contributions bridging
the gap between Computational Complexity and Programming Language
Theory are therefore of particular interest.

  If a category C has pullbacs no terminal object, then has C finite
product?

  No. The simplest counterexample is the discrete category with two
objects.

This is in reply to Eduardo Dubuc (quoted after the reply).  I have a major
point and a minor point.

Minor point: The phrase "labeled graph" usually allows different nodes to have
the same label.  Eduardo clearly intends, however, that the labeling be
injective.  (In the usual sense there are n^n labels, not n!).  This is only a
matter of terminology.  My answer refers to injective labeling as he intended. 
(Better terminology for his purposes would be to call them NAMED nodes.)

Major point:  Any way you store an unlabeled graph in a computer will involve a
memory location for each node, and so introduces a labeling, indeed a total
ordering, on the nodes.  However, a high level language with pointers such as C
can be used to describe the structure without any names being given
explicitly.  The structure head will point to a node, which will have a pointer
to another node, etc, and the program text will not mention all the nodes
directly.  For the purpose of computing with the graph, you can have the
program traverse the nodes without naming them.  This is a commonly used
technique.  (There will have to be pointer structures for the edges with
pointers to the two nodes each is incident on.)  When the program is compiled,
the nodes are made to correspond to memory locations but the locations are
hidden from the user.  It seems to me that this preserves the psychology of a
drawing with no labels on the nodes.

You can respond that each node has an implicit label, essentially an integer,
which is the number of pointers you have to dereference to get to the node. 
But that is just like saying that in the drawing of the graph on a piece of
paper, each node has an implicit label, namely its location on the paper.  If
you allow implicit labels like this the drawing has them and so does the graph
in the computer.  If you don't allow them then neither has labels.

Let me forestall someone bringing up a red herring:  The coordinates of the
node on the paper depend on an arbitrary choice of coordinate system, unlike
the number of pointers you need to get to the stored node in the computer. 
This argument, if someone makes it, is based on a misreading of what I said.  I
said each node is labeled by its location on the paper.  I didn't say the
coordinates of the location.  The location itself is the label.  (But how do
you talk about it?  You POINT to it!)

was already answered by Francis Borceux, who has beautifully written 
most of the book "Galois theories". I would like to add:

I would say, "Field and Galois theory" sounds too general. For instance 
any such introduction should include a lot of Group theory and 
polynomials, which of course would look much nicer if various parts of 
Category theory were involved - but this is a very long story!

So, let me replace "Field and Galois theory" by just "The fundamental 
theorem of Galois theory" - and call it GFT for short.

The standard formulation of GFT includes the following assertions about 
a finite Galois extension E/K with the Galois group G = Gal(E/K):

GFT1: The opposite lattice of subextensions of E/K is isomorphic to the 
lattice of subgroups of G; under this isomorphism a subextension F/K 
corresponds to the subgroup Gal(E/F) = {g in G: ga = a for all a in 
F}, and therefore a subgroup H in G corresponds to {a in E: ga = a for 
all g in H}.

GFT2: A subextension F/K of E/K is normal (equivalently, Galois) if and 
only if its corresponding subgroup Gal(E/F) is normal, and if this is 
the case, then Gal(F/K) is canonically isomorphic to the quotient group. 
Moreover, every K-homomorphism of subextensions of E/K extends to a 
K-automorphism of E.

Unfortunately even today all books in Algebra give only this kind of 
formulation. I think actually the right name for it is not "standard" 
but "prehistoric" - since more than 40 years ago Chevalley and 
Grothendieck understood that it is a straightforward consequence of the 
following simple and nice formulation:

Grothendieck's GFT restricted: The category of subextensions of E/K 
(with morphisms all K-homomorphisms) is equivalent to the category of 
transitive G-sets, where E/K and G are as above.

Moreover, one does not really want what I called "restricted", and then 
the right formulation becomes:

Grothendieck's GFT: The category of K-algebras split over E/K is 
equivalent to the category of finite G-sets. Here a K-algebra A is said 
to be split over E/K if its tensor product over K with E is isomorphic 
to the Cartesian product of a finite number of copies of E; note that A 
is split over E/K if and only if it is itself isomorphic to the 
Cartesian product of a finite number of subextensions of E/K.

There are many theorems similar or more general then this, proved by 
Chevalley and Grothendieck themselves, by A. R. Magid, M. Barr and R. 
Diaconescu, and others. In 1984 I realized that there is a purely 
categorical formulation and a purely categorical proof - before that the 
topos-theoretic level was considered as the most general, although there 
was no topos-theoretic extension of Magid's theorem. And what I call now 
Categorical Galois theory - let us say CGT for short - has important 
examples very far from Grothendieck and topos theory. One of them, 
studied in joint work with G. M. Kelly is of what we called generalized 
central extensions in universal algebra. CGT actually uses very simple 
category theory (pullbacks, adjoint functors, monadicity, internal 
category actions), but after many attempts I found it very difficult to 
explain it to "non-category-theorists" - I would say, simply because 
most of them do not believe that General Category theory can have 
non-trivial applications! A further generalization of CGT to so-called 
variable categories was developed in joint work with D. Schumacher and 
R. H. Street. In some sense it includes Street's theory of torsors, 
Joyal - Tierney's theorem on geometric morphisms of toposes, and Tannaka 
duality.

I said that the simplest example of a category with pullbacks but not
products is the discrete category with two objects. Come to think of
it, any category with exactly two morphisms is an example.

Initial question was

	  If a category C has pullbacs no terminal object, then has C finite
	  product?

Now, think of empty category (one without objects and morphisms):

(*) it doesn't contain terminal object
(*) it does have pullbacks of all pairs of objects (because there are none)
(*) it doesn't contain all finite products (as it doesn't contain limit
of empty diagram---terminal object)

Now, simplify _this_ counter-example. :)

Actually, if terminal object is considered as product of zero multipliers
(as it's usually does), then initial question contains answer in itself.

Nikita.

Currently John Power and myself are involved in providing an algebraic
foundation (in category-theoretic terms) of higraphs, the "visual
formalism" [1] which underlie Statecharts. On this basis, we are
adding more features in an attempt to study a large subset of the
Statecharts language.

In brief, our approach is to regard higraphs as graphs in Poset, the
category of partially ordered sets and monotone functions. Our main
results so far pertain to operations underpinning the semantics of
Statecharts and the concept of zooming described by Harel in
[1]. Technical details will appear soon in my web page:
http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~kxt

More generally, our interests are in studying domain-specific
programming and specification languages which have a strong
diagrammatic component. Statecharts present a most interesting case
for study, as they contain a multitude of interacting diagrammatic
features and support practically important operations such as
zooming. Part of our objective is to evaluate how the different
features blend together, in an attempt to research good design
principles for the kind of diagrammatic languages used in computing.

I know of a paper by Uselton and Smolka, but which does not use
categories:

"A Compositional Semantics for Statecharts using Labeled Transition
Systems", by A. Uselton, S. Smolka, available online at:
http://www.di.ufpe.br/~lrl/statecharts_js.html

I'm afraid I do not know of any such work. However, your view of
STATEMATE semantics seems most interesting. Please feel free to email
me (kxt@dcs.ed.ac.uk) or John (ajp@dcs.ed.ac.uk) for a more detailed
techical discussion on this subject or any of the above.

this is in reply to Charles Wells, I quote in between  ' " '

" Major point:  Any way you store an unlabeled graph in a computer will
involve a memory location for each node, and so introduces a labeling,
indeed a total ordering, on the nodes.  However, a high level language
with pointers such as C can be used to describe the structure without any
names being given explicitly.  The structure head will point to a node,
which will have a pointer
to another node, etc, and the program text will not mention all the nodes
directly.  For the purpose of computing with the graph, you can have the
program traverse the nodes without naming them.  This is a commonly used
technique.  (There will have to be pointer structures for the edges with
pointers to the two nodes each is incident on.)  When the program is
compiled, the nodes are made to correspond to memory locations but the
locations are hidden from the user.  It seems to me that this preserves
the psychology of a drawing with no labels on the nodes. "

quite wright, i agree that the technique you describe "preserves the
psychology of a drawing with no labels on the nodes. ".

 i had no thought about the pointer technique  !!!

but then, try to put an unlabeled graph in a computer using assembler
languge  !

is what i should have said !

" You can respond that each node has an implicit label, essentially an
integer, which is the number of pointers you have to dereference to get to
the node. But that is just like saying that in the drawing of the graph on
a piece of paper, each node has an implicit label, namely its location on
the paper. If you allow implicit labels like this the drawing has them and
so does the graph in the computer.  If you don't allow them then neither
has labels.

Let me forestall someone bringing up a red herring:  The coordinates of
the node on the paper depend on an arbitrary choice of coordinate system,
unlike the number of pointers you need to get to the stored node in the
computer. This argument, if someone makes it, is based on a misreading of
what I said.  I said each node is labeled by its location on the paper.  I
didn't say the coordinates of the location.  The location itself is the
label. "

the final conclusion of your arguing : " The location itself is the label" 
means that there is no such a thing as an unlabeled graph.

interesting . . . 

but what about permutation of the labels ? 

en fin !  we should perhaps leave this problem to the philosophers, if
they would be able to understand it 

e.d.

I want to take up the discussion on ``toposes vs. sets'' from another point
of view. Over the years a few questions have accumulated and I'd be interested 
in the opinion of the experts.

As Bill Lawvere has pointed out in his reply to the original question there 
are several meanings in which one can understand the relation  

               ``toposes vs. set theory''.

One such distinction is static sets vs. variable sets and one can hardly deny
that the latter are of enormous importance for understanding modern mathematics
from a conceptual point of view. That's probably what most categorists have in
mind when they defend categories as superior to traditional set theory. 
Another argument probably is that the official language of axiomatic set 
theory is most inconvenient for actual formalisation of mathematics. One
knows that in principle one always can eliminate function symbols in favour
of relation symbols but that leads to an explosion of length of formulas and
ends in something fairly uncomprehensible.Thus, categorists and also quite a
few logicians are in favour of formal systems based function application and 
predication instead of using just one single relation  \epsilon  besides 
equality because function application and predication are the basic 
constitutents of actual mathematical statements and, moreover, appear most 
naturally from the categorical notion of topos. In the end this amounts to 
the point of view that HAH (Higher Order Arithmetic), the internal language 
of the free topos with NNO, is the formal system which is most suitable for 
formalizing mathematics (if one wants to embark on such an endeavour at all).

Well, but there are some reasons why HAH may be considered as non-sufficient 
at least from a logical point of view. As Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF(C) 
and, actually, already Zermelo's Set Theory Z(C) prove the consistency of HAH 
and accordingly they are non-conservative extensions of HAH. Well, one might 
argue that this lack of conservativity only affects "meta-statements" and not 
``real mathematical statements''. Even hard boiled set theorists would admit 
that "99% of modern mathematics can be formalised in HAH" (such a statement 
for Zermelo's Z(C) instead of HAH can be found e.g. in Kunen's monograph on 
set theory). However, there  do exists natural mathematical statements which 
can be formulated in the language of HAH but proved only in ZF though they are
fairly different in character from ``meta-statements''. 
A typical such example is Borel Determinacy (BD) saying that for every Borel
set X in Baire space either player or opponent has a winning strategy for the 
game G_X where in each step each player plays a natural number and in the end 
(after \omega steps) player has won if and only if the resulting sequence of 
numbers lies in X.
>From this point of view I think one can hardly insist that HAH is the ultima 
ratio as it prevents us from proving meaningful statements which can be
formulated in HAH. Of course, one might still have in mind an open-ended 
axiomatization of HAH where one adopts an axiom, as e.g. BD, whenever 
convenient. This seems to be the attitude for example in SDG where one 
postulates by need axioms ensuring the existence of particular functions such
as  cos  and  sin  instead of constructing them via some series. It seems to 
me that such an attitude is absolutely ok as long as one is interested only 
in appropriate formalism for expressing mathematical facts and not in the 
strength of axiomatizations.

However, if one wants to arrive at a formal system which allows one to derive 
(in principle) "all current mathematics" then I think one has to accept that
HAH is not satisfactory simply because it is too weak. On the other hand it
still is the case that traditional syntax of ZF is not very convenient as a 
formalisation of mathematical practice. Therefore, it might be worthwhile to
look for formal systems of a type-theoretic character equiconsistent to ZF(C)
and including ZF(C) via translation. Well, such a language is available, namely
the so-called "Calculus of Inductive Constructions" an impredicative type
theory with an infinite hierarchy of universes. This is described in

   Werner, Benjamin
   Sets in types, types in sets. 
   Theoretical aspects of computer software (Sendai, 1997), 530--546, 
   Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 1281, 
   Springer, Berlin, 1997.  
   ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/coq/Benjamin.Werner/zfc.ps.gz

where one also can find (sketches of) proofs of the meta-theoretic properties 
mentioned above.
The reason why systems like the "Calculus of Inductive Constructions" are as
strong as ZF(C) is that they allow one to 

     define FAMILIES of TYPES by structural recursion.

which is precisely what the set theoretic axiom of replacement is good for.
However, type theoretic language does bring this to the point more clearly
than the set-theoretic axiom of replacement which is often used in mathematical
practice to formulate the image of a function  f : A -> B namely as 
{ f(a) | a \in A} which certainly has to be considered as sort of an overkill
because this can be formulated in HAH as well. The real strength of the axiom
of replacement is used when defining `images of functions without a codomain'
as e.g. families of sets indexed by some inductive type (e.g. an ordinal).
The very purpose of type-theoretic universes is to provide a codomain for
such `functions without codomain'.
According to these observations I get the impression that what topos logic
is missing is a concept of universe which allows one to define by recursion
not only families of objects but also families of types.

I want to conclude my remarks with a pointer to a recent paper by Alex Simpson
on 

    Solving Domain Equations in Models of Intuitionistic Set Theory

(to be found at http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/als/Research/rde.ps.gz) where in
the last paragraph of section 5 (p.12) he gives a counterexample to the claim 
that 

     in a topos satisfying the usual axioms of SDT (Synthetic Domain Theory) 
     one always can solve domain equations.

The reason is that the topos considered there doesn't allow one to construct
certain N-indexed families. (This is a style of argument well-known from the
usual proofs in set theory showing that Z(C) is weaker than ZF(C)!)


I hope that it has got clear from my formulations that I am not at all 
``anti-category''. However, I always found it most confusing when in some
texts on toposes I read the statement that the logic of toposes coincides
with intuitionistic set theory. I think that most classically trained 
logicians get immediately puzzled by such statements because they know very
well that set theory is stronger than type theory and, therefore, feel sort
of repelled by such oversimplifying statements.
Moreover, during the 90ies there have been developed fascinating categorical
accounts of constructive set theory by Joyal, Moerdijk, Simpson, Butz and 
Palmgren. I think it would be an interesting question to clarify the relation
between this account and the one by universes.

theory with an infinite hierarchy of universes. This is described in

   Werner, Benjamin
   Sets in types, types in sets. 
   Theoretical aspects of computer software (Sendai, 1997), 530--546, 
   Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 1281, 
   Springer, Berlin, 1997.  
   ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/coq/Benjamin.Werner/zfc.ps.gz

where one also can find (sketches of) proofs of the meta-theoretic properties 
mentioned above.
The reason why systems like the "Calculus of Inductive Constructions" are as
strong as ZF(C) is that they allow one to 

     define FAMILIES of TYPES by structural recursion.

which is precisely what the set theoretic axiom of replacement is good for.
However, type theoretic language does bring this to the point more clearly
than the set-theoretic axiom of replacement which is often used in mathematical
practice to formulate the image of a function  f : A -> B namely as 
{ f(a) | a \in A} which certainly has to be considered as sort of an overkill
because this can be formulated in HAH as well. The real strength of the axiom
of replacement is used when defining `images of functions without a codomain'
as e.g. families of sets indexed by some inductive type (e.g. an ordinal).
The very purpose of type-theoretic universes is to provide a codomain for
such `functions without codomain'.
According to these observations I get the impression that what topos logic
is missing is a concept of universe which allows one to define by recursion
not only families of objects but also families of types.

I want to conclude my remarks with a pointer to a recent paper by Alex Simpson
on 

    Solving Domain Equations in Models of Intuitionistic Set Theory

(to be found at http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/als/Research/rde.ps.gz) where in
the last paragraph of section 5 (p.12) he gives a counterexample to the claim 
that 

     in a topos satisfying the usual axioms of SDT (Synthetic Domain Theory) 
     one always can solve domain equations.

The reason is that the topos considered there doesn't allow one to construct
certain N-indexed families. (This is a style of argument well-known from the
usual proofs in set theory showing that Z(C) is weaker than ZF(C)!)


I hope that it has got clear from my formulations that I am not at all 
``anti-category''. However, I always found it most confusing when in some
texts on toposes I read the statement that the logic of toposes coincides
with intuitionistic set theory. I think that most classically trained 
logicians get immediately puzzled by such statements because they know very
well that set theory is stronger than type theory and, therefore, feel sort
of repelled by such oversimplifying statements.
Moreover, during the 90ies there have been developed fascinating categorical
accounts of constructive set theory by Joyal, Moerdijk, Simpson, Butz and 
Palmgren. I think it would be an interesting question to clarify the relation
between this account and the one by universes.

Does anyone have a copy of Jon Beck's thesis?  I have received a request
from a Georgian mathematician (the editor and founder of Homology,
Homotopy and Applications) who has no access to foreign exchange for a
copy.  I have looked and I do not have one, although I must have once.
Actually, I don't have a copy of my own thesis (and they have disappeared
from the Penn library).

I would like to post the following annoucement for your category theorists. 


Galois Theories
by Francis Borceux and George Janeldize

Starting from the classical finite-dimensional Galois theory of fields,
this book develops Galois theory in a much more general context. The
authors first formalize the categorical context in which a general Galois
theorem holds, and then give applications to Galois theory for commutative
rings, central extensions of groups, the topological theory of covering
maps and a Galois theorem for toposes. The book is a hardback, 360 pages,
and costs $74.95 (50.00 in UK).  For more information about the book, or
to order a copy, please visit www.cambridge.org.


Please let me know if you need additional information from me

Thanks,
Cathy

GENERAL INFORMATION

The 13th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI'01)
will take place at the University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, during two
weeks in August, from August 13 until 24.

The ESSLLI Summer Schools are organised under the auspices of FoLLI
(http://www.folli.uva.nl), the European Association for Logic, Language and
Information.

The main focus of the European Summer Schools is the interface between
linguistics, logic and computation. Foundational, introductory and advanced
courses, workshops and special events cover a wide variety of topics within
six areas of interest:

  * Logic
  * Language
  * Computation
  * Logic and Language
  * Logic and Computation
  * Language and Computation

The number of courses offered is over 50. Previous summer schools have been
highly successful, attracting around 500 students from Europe and elsewhere.
The school has developed into an important meeting place and forum for
discussion for students, researchers and IT professionals interested in
the interdisciplinary study of Logic, Language and Information. In addition
to courses, workshops and evening lectures there will be a Student Session
and a social program.


COURSE PROGRAM

The full scientific program can be found at our home page. Evening
Lectures are given by

 * Edward L. Keenan "Spinoza Lecture" (UCLA)
 * Yannis Moschovakis "Vienna Circle Lecture" (UCLA)
 * Keith Devlin (Saint Mary's College, California)
 * Jaakko Hintikka (Boston & Helsinki)
 * Bonnie Webber (Edinburgh)


WORKSHOPS

There are currently several Calls for Workshop Papers. Please visit our
home page for detailed information.


TRAVEL AND LOCAL INFORMATION

By plane to Helsinki airport and then a 30-minute nonstop coach or taxi
service to the main railway station. From the railway station 5-minute walk
to the university.

A gateway between East and West, the city of Helsinki (population 1M) is
the capital of Finland and one of the nine European Cities of Culture for
the millennium. It is located at the warm and sunny south coast of Finland,
within an easy reach from the main airports worldwide, or inside Europe by
car or regular train services, or using the ferry services operating within
the Baltic region.

The scientific program of ESSLLI'01 will be held in the University Main
Building, located on the University city campus at the very centre of
Helsinki. The accommodation will be arranged at the University Summer Hotel
close to the city campus. The accommodation includes sauna and breakfast.


REGISTRATION

ESSLLI 2001 is now open for registration. The registration fee for students
is just ECU 190, for scholars ECU 350, and for industrial affiliates ECU 600.
Please visit our home page for the on-line registration form and detailed
instructions.

** Early registration deadline: 30 April 2001 **

All participants will get a letter of invitation to facilitate the procedure
of getting a visa.


GRANTS

There will be a limited number of grants available, to partially support
travel, registration and accommodation for ESSLLI'01. Instructions for
grant applications are found at our home page.

** Deadline for grant applications: 31 May 2001 **


SPEACIAL EVENTS

During ESSLLI, special "Finnish for Foreigners" language courses will be
organised, as well as various excursions and other social events. Helsinki

The discussion around the question in Re:above is expired but it seems
not too much was said that might be directly related to problems in the
applied domains in question and, thus, be really understood and
appreciated by  the corresponding part of  the audience. Bill Lawvere is
of course right  in his << strong advice to actually learn some category 
theory, rather than resting content with slinging back and forth 
ill-defined epithets like "set theory", "contingency", etc >> but  still 
there are no King's ways in math,  and learning  CT, as any other rich 
math discipline, needs efforts and time. Well, efforts and time is not a 
problem for students but a working specialist will reasonably require a 
certain motivation and justification for investing his resources into 
CT-studies.

No doubts, the best justification is a host of examples of real 
successful
applications ("success stories"), and in a discussion in this list in 
1997 
few were described. However, the NCDoms (Newly Created Domains as
Lawvere called them) is an enormous territory and a few discrete example
in particular areas do not set enough motivation/justification for the
entire region. What is needed is a representative net of examples but
still
we have no it. So, for a while, a discrete set of new  examples, and
substantial conceptual / theoretical considerations too,  would not be
useless and a few were presented in the discussion. I'm afraid however
that for a non-CT-part of the audience the arguments may seem far  too
general and/or too abstract, and we again come to the same issue at the
beginning of the posting...

There is a general problem of  applying math to engineering domains and, 
correspondingly, of interaction between  mathematicians and engineers. 
The former must respect a lot of formal details (in order to exist, the 
construction has to be formally consistent) and hence must go into the 
depth of consistent formalization. The latter must respect a lot of 
obstacles of the real world (to exist, the construction has to work) and 
hence must go into the width of  functioning in the real world. 
Amalgamation of math depth with engineering width is a non-trivial task 
that needs working out a spacious array of details (every mathematician 
who ever tried to work in an industrial environment knows it) but at the 
end you have some kind of 3D vision beneficial for the both sides. (This 
general opposition "depth vs. width" in the case of "Math vs. NSDs" has 
some quite concrete technical aspects, see below). 

In these terms, an overall picture appeared in the discussion so far is 
somewhat like a discrete collection of  bore-pits (well, they are 
connected at a depth, but it's hardly visible from the surface). To get 
a presentation more relevant for NCDs, I've tried to write a text 
integrating these pits into something wider ("a foundation pit" :). That 
is, I've tried (i) to trace some of the lines appeared in the discussion 
and add a bit of engineering width to them, (ii) to integrate them into 
an observable picture, (iii) to make some details a bit more 
understandable for the "foreign" part of the audience (and probably 
annoying for the "native" part so that my head is on the two platters 
simultaneously), and finally (iv), to explain something for myself.

The resulting text  turned out very bulky and can be found on 
http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~frank/Diskin.ps
(thanks to Frank Piessens for hospitality).

Below is a brief summary of the text and the table of contents to look
thru before starting, or not starting, the tour.

Regards,
--Zinovy Diskin

 BRIEF SUMMARY   

(I)   OBSERVATION.  In many newly created domains (NCDs)  they deal
with a stuff in much similar to that managed in mathematics. Like a
mathematician, an NCD-specialist deals with design (definition),
presentation and reasoning about structures modeling a piece of reality
(material, informational, "computeral") in an abstract  way, suppressing 
some details (irrelevant for the model)  and explicating others 
(important 
but often residing in intuition / default  assumptions and therefore 
implicit).
Hence,  to look for a suitable math framework(s) for NCDs, one should 
look at *meta*mathematics  -- a part of mathematics  aimed at  modeling
mathematics by mathematical means. 

(II)   OBSERVATION.  Category theory  (CT) is, in essence,  a consistent 
*meta*mathematical framework  where relations, manipulations and 
transformations of / between  math structures are considered in an 
abstract and precise way.  In a sense, CT is a discipline and framework 
for 
mathematical structure engineering.  It is abstract enough to provide an 
extreme flexibility and simultaneously concrete enough to discover CT-
structures in applications in a quite immediate way.  In addition, this 
framework is essentially algebraic (and in some precise sense too), well 
structured itself  and hence is quite manageable and effective. 

(III)  It follows from (I) and (II) that CT appears to be a  good 
candidate  for 
an integral math framework, and effective machinery too,  for 
applications 
in NCDs. Of course, in each particular context suitable CT-patterns 
should 
be found and adjusted, and their match with NCDs-structures to be
managed should be checked. An example (rough sketch) of such an 
activity for the case of software engineering is presented below.

(IV) OBSERVATION: CT vs. SE (software engineering in a wide sense 
including business modeling and knowledge representation). It appears 
that some of major mechanisms invented (and implemented!) in SE to 
manage the complexity of structures involved  -- object orientation, set 
orientation, graphic notations, multi-level system   architectures -- 
are 
based on ideas very close to those developed in CT. To wit: object and 
set 
orientations together appear as a kind of SE-realization of the arrow
thinking underlying CT, and graph-based syntax and multi-level
organization of  the CT-stuff  are evident and speak for themselves.

(V) SPECULATION. While the theoretical part of the NCDs community is
discussing whether CT is relevant or not, the (software) engineering 
part is 
already using categorical, in essence, ideas in a implicit way. Nothing
surprising: the same goal of  building a framework where complex
structures (computational and specificational) could be managed in a 
systematic and effective way has led engineers and mathematicians to 
close results. Making this implicit partnership explicit would benefit 
the
both sides.

I am looking for information about work
on the representation of topological properties
(esp. connectedness) using intuitionistic logic.
I presently know about definitions of connectedness
in "Sheaves and Logic" (Fourman-Scott 79) and
"Formal spaces" (Fourman-Grayson 82). 

I would be interested in knowing whether there 
has been more work, esp. whether there
is something that may have some relation with 
discrete geometry.

Thank you for your help,

Paolo
