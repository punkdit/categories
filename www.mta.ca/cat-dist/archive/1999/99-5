Dear Category Theorists,

I'm looking for a reference on the following bi-categorical variant of
the construction of Kleisli categories.

Start from a pseudo-free construction $F$ between (2-)categories $\cat
C$ and $\cat D$. In the case I'm interested in, $F$ arises from a finite
cocompletion. For example, $\cat C$ is the category of small categories
and $\cat D$ is the category of small categories with finite colimits.  

Constructing (in the usual way) the Kleisli category $\cat K$ for $F$
leads to a bi-category since the universal property used to define the
composition in $\cat K$ holds only up to a unique natural isomorphism.   

Then, there exists a (unique?) homomorphism of bi-categories $G: \cat K
\to \cat D$ which commutes with the obvious embedding of $\cat C$ into
$\cat K$ and (the pseudo functor induced by) $F$. 

I understand that pseudo-free constructions of the above kind can be
axiomatized by means of Kock-Zoeberlein (KZ) monads. Thus, any reference
on Kleisli-like constructions for KZ monads would do. 
For me, it was simpler to work directly with the universal properties,
in particular since all the coherence laws are automatic.

Any hints or references to relevant literature would be much
appreciated.

Best regards,
Reiko Heckel.

                                   Abstract

A systematic treatment of weak bisimulation and observational congruence on
presheaf models is presented.  The theory is developed with respect to a
``hiding'' functor from a category of paths to observable paths.  Via a view
of processes as bundles, we are able to account for weak morphisms (roughly
only required to preserve observable paths) and to derive a saturation monad
(on the category of presheaves over the category of paths).  Weak morphisms
may be encoded as strong ones via the Kleisli construction associated to the
saturation monad.  A general notion of weak open-map bisimulation is
introduced, and results relating various notions of strong and weak
bisimulation are provided.  The abstract theory is accompanied by the concrete
study of two key models for concurrency, the interleaving model of
synchronisation trees and the independence model of labelled event structures.


Comments are welcome.

Bonjour,


Let us call cubical omega-category a cubical complex
with connections and operations +_j like in the
paper "On the algebra of cube", Brown & Higgins or
like in Al-Agl's PhD "Aspect of multiple categories".
There is a conjecture which claims that the category 
of cubical omega-categories is equivalent to the category 
of globular omega-categories. If I understand correctly, 
the conjecture was proved  in some richer framework 
but seems to be (in my knowledge) still open as stated 
above. 

My question is : is there a similar conjecture for 
weak omega-category ? Is there a notion of cubical
weak omega-category somewhere in the literature
and a notion of globular weak omega-category ?

Any reference is welcome. I have found nothing with
the usual research engine but maybe I did not use
the good key-word.

Combinatorial homology and image analysis
M. Grandis

ABSTRACT. This is the sequel of a paper, cited as Part I ("An intrinsic
homotopy theory for simplicial complexes, with applications to image
analysis"), introducing intrinsic homotopies and homotopy groups for
simplicial complexes. We study here the relations of this intrinsic
homotopy theory with the well-known intrinsic homology theory of simplicial
complexes.
     Also here, the applications are aimed at image analysis. A metric
space  X  has a structure  t_e(X)  of simplicial complex at each resolution
e > 0;  the corresponding *metric combinatorial homology groups*  H_n(
t_e(X)) can be directly computed, in cases of interest for applications,
via the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence and a study of deformation retracts
given in Part I.

There is certainly a notion of globular weak omega-category: in fact, there
are at least two such. One is Batanin's, another is mine. (If you already
have an early version of the preprint of mine cited below then it will say
that the definition I present *is* Batanin's. He's since pointed out that
it's different.) I've also sketched out how one might define weak cubical
omega-category in a similar style, although there's one important hole in
this which I haven't been able to fill. There have probably been other
attempts to get a notion of weak cubical omega-category.

I think that the conjecture you describe (for *weak* omega-categories) must
be beyond our reach for a little while yet, if it's even plausible. One
reason is that we have to say what the morphisms are in the category of weak
[cubical] omega-categories. If you took the morphisms to be strict functors
(i.e. those preserving composition on the nose) then I suspect the conjecture
would fail. A more natural and plausible choice would be the weak functors
(those maps preserving composition up to coherent equivalence). However,
we seem not to understand weak functors very well at the moment. Batanin has
a definition of weak functor for the notion of weak omega-category he
presents, but I don't know that a similar thing has been done in the cubical
context. So it may not even be possible to *formulate* the conjecture in
today's language, let alone prove it.

   LPNMR'99 is the fifth in the series of international meetings on logic
   programming and nonmonotonic reasoning. Four previous meetings were
   held in Washington, U.S.A., in 1991, in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1993, in
   Lexington, U.S.A., in 1995, and in Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1997.

   LPNMR'99 will be coordinated with the ICLP'99, which starts on November
   29 in Las Cruces, approximately 40 miles from El Paso.   

   The proceedings of LPNMR'99 will be published by Springer in the
   LNCS/LNAI series (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/).

Location

   El Paso, Texas is a city of nearly three-quarters of a million people,
   which sprawls across hundreds of square miles of desert and rambling
   foothills. The Franklin Mountains, southern tip of the Rockies, slice
   El Paso nearly in two. With its classic Western geography and
   tri-cultural history, El Paso makes an interesting place to visit.
 
   El Paso is the gateway to Juarez, Mexico (US citizens do not need a
   visa for a short visit across the border), and to southern New Mexico
   with such recognized attractions as Fort Bliss, Carlsbad Caverns and
   White Sands National Memorial.  El Paso's dry, sunny, warm desert
   climate earned the city the nickname Sun City.
   
Aim and Scope

   The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between
   researchers interested in the design and implementation of logic based
   programming languages and database systems and researchers who work in
   the areas of knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning.
   
   A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest include:

    1. Development and mathematical investigation of logical systems with
       non-monotonic entailment relations. This includes (but is not
       limited to)
         1. Extensions of ``classical'' LPNMR languages by new logical
            connectives and new inference capabilities such as abduction,
            reasoning by cases, etc;
         2. Semantics of new and existing languages;
         3. Relationship between various formalisms;
         4. Complexity and expressive power;
         5. Development and implementation of inference mechanisms for
            LPNMR systems;
         6. Updates and other operations on LPNMR systems;
         7. LPNMR systems with uncertainty.

    2. Applications of LPNMR systems.
         1. Methodology of representing knowledge in LPNMR languages.
            Theory and practice;
         2. LPNMR languages and algorithms in planning, diagnoses,
            software engineering, and other domains;
         3. Implemented LPNMR systems: Descriptions, Comparisons,
            Evaluations and Benchmarks.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION:

The Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary is hosting 
the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop on June 3rd - 6th, 
1999 at the Kananaskis Field Station in Alberta, Canada.

The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers in 
mathematics and computer science with a focus on the application of 
category theory in computer science.  It is a three day meeting, that 
starts with a day of tutorials aimed at students and newcomers to 
category theory, followed by a day and a half of research talks.

The meeting this year has a little website (the schedule and speakers 
will be announced on the site) see:

     http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~fmcs99 

The workshop will have approximately the same format as last year,  
with a day of tutorials on friday June 4 and shorter research 
presentations on June 5 and 6.  

Tutorials will be given by:
     Ernie Manes         More monads ...
     Rick Blute          Linear Logic
     Phil Mulry          Partial maps
     David Benson        Sketches and complexity

Due to the location (in the foothills of the Rockies) we shall be 
adopting a mountain conference schedule: lectures will run 
9:00am - 12:00pm, packed lunches (a chance for walks and talks etc.), 
supper at 5:30pm, and lectures resume 7:00pm - 10:00pm.  The area 
offers walks of all standards in some of the most stunning mountain 
scenery of the Rockies.  In June the evenings still get quite cool.

We do have limited support for student participation (for which one 
must apply) as usual student participation and talks are encouraged.
If you would like to attend this year please visit the web site and 
send in your registration form!

I look forward to seeing you at FMCS ... 

Robin Cockett

                         2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

                             PROBMIV'99     

  2nd International Workshop on Probabilistic Methods in Verification

                  http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/probmiv99/ 

                       a satellite to CONCUR'99
 
                       Eindhoven, 23rd Aug 1999 
           (to coincide with EXPRESS'99, another satellite)
_________________________________________________________________________

   
SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP 
  
Probability inherently features in software and hardware systems,
either as a means to derive efficient solutions (e.g. randomization),
or as a result of unreliable or unpredictable behaviour (e.g.
fault-tolerant systems, computer networks, etc).  *Probabilistic
verification* encompasses a range of theoretical, algorithmic and
programming methods that assist in establishing the correctness of
probabilistic systems against specifications.  Typically this involves
calculating the probability bounds for a temporal logic formula being
satisfied, based on an appropriate probability space on computations,
but also includes properties such as cost analysis and long-run
average.  Additionally, probabilistic verification can provide
guarantees the specifications hold with satisfactory probability in
cases when conventional model checking is not feasible.


The idea of this workshop is to bring together researchers that apply
probabilistic methods across the whole spectrum of verification. The
meeting aims to enable cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques
between areas that are usually not in regular contact through
conferences, from semantics, probability theory, performance analysis
and computational linear algebra, through randomized algorithms,
probabilistic  logics, model checking, abstract interpretation, to
practical experimental work, tools and applications.

This is the second workshop of this kind.  The first meeting,
PROBMIV'98 was held in 1998 as a satellite to LICS.  In 1999, the
workshop takes place as a satellite to CONCUR.

     mzk@cs.bham.ac.uk 
   
All submissions will be refereed in the normal manner.  Preliminary
proceedings, excluding short abstracts, will be published
electronically and as a Technical Report of the University of
Birmingham, to be available at the workshop.  We are currently
investigating the possibility of publishing proceedings after the
workshop as a volume of ENTCS jointly with the EXPRESS'99 workshop.

			First Call for Papers

		     Third International Workshop

		  ``Frontiers of Combining Systems''
			     FroCoS'2000

		  March 22-24, 2000, Nancy, France

	     http://www.loria.fr/conferences/frocos2000/


In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,
program development and proof, artificial intelligence, there is an
obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference mechanisms
for special tasks. In order to be usable in practice, these
specialized systems must be combined with each other, and they must be 
integrated into general purpose systems.  The development of general 
techniques for the combination and integration of special systems has
been initiated in many areas.

The two previous international workshops on ``Frontiers of Combining
Systems'' were held in Munich (1996) and in Amsterdam (1998). 
Like its predecessors, FroCoS'2000 is intended to offer a common
forum for research activities in the general area of combination and 
integration of systems, and on their practical use. 

Suggested, but not exclusive topics of interest for the workshop are: 

 * combination of logics 

 * combination of constraint solving techniques, of decision procedures,
   of term rewriting systems

 * combination of deduction systems and computer algebra

 * integration of decision procedures and other solving processes into
   constraint programming and deduction systems 

 * modelisation of hybrid systems 

 * logic modelling of multi-agent systems.


We expect to attract high quality original papers that cover relevant
aspects of these topics. All submissions will be thoroughly evaluated.
On the basis of the referee reports, papers will be selected for
presentation at the conference and for the published post-conference 
proceedings.

X-Status: 

There is a fairly standard encoding of recursive types
into polymorphic lambda calculus, given by

	rec X.F[X]  =  all X.(F[X] -> X) -> X

where F[X] is a type in which the type variable X appears only
covariantly.  Recall that every covariant type corresponds to a
covariant functor, so for every h:X->Y we have F[h]:F[X]->F[Y].
If we abbreviate T = rec X.F[X], then the key functions on this
type are given by the polymorphic lambda terms:

	fold : all X.(F[X] -> X) -> T -> X
	fold = Lam X.lam k:F[X]->X.lam t:T.t{X}(k)

	in   : F[T] -> T
	in   = lam u:F[T].Lam X.lam k:F[X]->X.k(F[fold{X}(k)](u))

	out  : T -> F[T]
	out  = fold{F[T]}(F[in])

Questions: Who first had this insight?  Where is a good place to find
this spelled out in the literature?  Please send results to me, and I
will summarize them for the list.  Cheers, -- P

		Paris, France, September 27, 1999
	http://www.tec.informatik.uni-rostock.de/IuK/congr/oosds99/
	
========================================================================

SCOPE OF WORKSHOP:
=================
The workshop is focused on specification languages for distributed 
systems which are extensions of object-oriented languages or have an 
object-oriented kind of base structure. The aim is to bring together
researchers interested in incorporating object-oriented concepts 
and  formal methods for specification of distributed systems and
behaviours. 

TOPICS (NOT EXCLUSIVE LIST):
============================
Object-oriented approaches to specification of distributed systems 
and behaviours.

Semantic models for concurrency and object-orientation (e.g. based on the 
lambda-calculus, process algebra, pi-calculus, linear logic).

Characteristic examples of object-oriented specification from real 
application domains (e.g. distributed algorithms, workflow specification, 
communication protocols).

Logic reasoning on distributed systems and behaviours.

SUBMISSION:
===========
The deadline for submission is September 2, 1999. 
Submission is in electronic form only.
Submission may be of two forms:
	Extended abstracts: up to 3 pages.
	Papers and reports: up to 6 pages.
In both cases a separate page with the following information: 
        title, author(s), corresponding author,
        contact information and a 12-15 lines summary 
should be included.
The papers and/or abstracts should be sent by e-mail to 
oosds99@informatik.uni-rostock.de.
Selection for presentation will be carried out by the organizers.
Emphasis is put on the potential of the submission to stimulate 
discussions in the above-mentioned scope.
Notification of acceptance is expected for September 14, 1999.

PUBLICATION:
============
The accepted submissions will be published electronically,
i.e. they will remain available from the workshop web page.
Furthermore, selected papers will be invited for post
workshop publication. 

RELATED EVENTS:
==============
This workshop is organized as a satellite workshop of PPDP'99,

     FIRST SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUMMER SCHOOL AND WORKSHOP ON 

  LOGIC, UNIVERSAL ALGEBRA, AND THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE

                        (LUATCS'99)

    Rand Afrikaans University, Johannesburg, South Africa 

                     December 1-10, 1999


                     SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT
                  AND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


LUATCS'99 is organized under the auspices of the Department of
Mathematics at the Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) in Johannesburg,
South Africa, the National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF),
the Laboratory for Formal Aspects and Complexity in Computer Science
(FACCS-Lab) at the University of Cape Town, and the Interest Group in
Logic, Universal Algebra and Theoretical Computer Science at the South
African Mathematical Society (SAMS).


  ADVISORY BOARD:
  Samson Abramsky (University of Edinburgh, UK)
  Hajnal Andreka (Math. Inst. of the Hungarian Acad. of Sciences)
  Johan van Benthem, Chair (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands) 
  Chris Brink (University of Wollongong, Australia) 
  Robin Hirsch (University College London, UK) 
  Wilfrid Hodges (Queen Mary and Westfield College, UK) 
  Bjarni Jonsson (Vanderbilt University, USA) 
  Istvan Nemeti (Math. Inst. of the Hungarian Acad. of Sciences) 
  Jeff Zucker (McMaster University, Canada)

  ORGANIZING COMMITTEE: 
  Isabella Burger (Rand Afrikaans University, local arrangements),
  Val Goranko (Rand Afrikaans University, co-chair), 
  Peter Jipsen (University of Cape Town, co-chair).


I. ACTIVITIES: Short introductory and advanced courses, tutorials and
workshops on each of the three subjects: Logic, Universal Algebra and
Theoretical Computer Science, as well as combined courses and
tutorials/workshops on specific topics within the scope of the
school. Also, there will be open sessions with contributed talks.

The courses and tutorials will be given by invited lecturers and will
be grouped in two parts: introductory and advanced.

The purpose of the single-subject courses is to give a concise
introduction into the basics, and some advanced topics of the subject
for participants with little or no background (for the introductory
courses) and with basic knowledge (for the advanced courses) in the
subject.

The purpose of the interdisciplinary courses, tutorials, and workshops
is to discuss the interaction between the subjects of the school.

A general purpose of the school is to reflect the current development
of each of the three subjects and the interaction between them, with
an emphasis on recent trends and research topics in them.

The introductory part is aimed at lower graduate (honours and masters)
students but will be accessible for undergraduates majoring in
mathematics and computer science too. Essentially no special
knowledge, but some formal background, will be expected for these
courses. The advanced part will be suitable for higher graduate
(masters and doctoral) students and researchers.


1) PART 1: Introductory courses. December 1-4, RAU-Island (Vaal Dam,
see below).  Each course will comprise four sessions and will give a
general background into the subject(s), necessary to follow the
advanced courses.

  COURSES AND LECTURERS:

2.2) WORKSHOPS and OPEN SESSIONS: 

Participants will have the opportunity to present their research at
open sessions and special workshop sessions.

If you wish to contribute a talk to any of the workshops, please
contact the respective organizer(s) BEFORE AUGUST 1 (see webpage
for email addresses).

For participation in the open session, send or e-mail in either plain
text, standard LaTeX, or Postscript, a one A4 page abstract to the
address of the school, to reach us BY AUGUST 1.

Notification of acceptance/rejection will be send to you soon after
submission, and not later than AUGUST 15, unless otherwise specified
by the workshop organizers.

More details on the courses, tutorials and workshops and detailed
programme of the School will be placed in due course on our Webpage at
       http://proof.mth.uct.ac.za/~pjipsen/luatcs99 
and sent to the registered participants with the 3rd announcement.


2.3) CREDITS: 
The courses offered at the school can be taken for official credit and
recognized (by prior arrangements with respective heads of
departments) as modules for graduate courses, after successful
completion of assignments given by the respective lecturers.


II. TIME: December 1-10, 1999. 9 working days, and a free/relocation
day on December 5. (Note that this is an early summer time in the
Southern hemisphere.)


III. PLACES AND ACCOMMODATION:  

Part I: December 1-4 1999, RAU-Island. This is a fairly large island
in the Vaal Dam, some 100 km south of Johannesburg. The island is a
nature reserve, with various game on it to be seen: springboks,
blesboks, gemsboks, zebras, gnus, etc. Besides the wilderness, it also
has conference, accommodation, and recreation facilities including: 3
lecture rooms with boards and overhead projectors (one of them with an
aircon); full board (accommodation and 3 meals a day), barbecue area,
swimming pool, rugby field, volley-ball court etc.

ARRIVAL AND REGISTRATION: November 30. We shall provide bus
transportation for all participants from RAU campus to the Island on
that day. There will be two buses, the first leaving at 12.00, and the
second at 16.00. We can transport, upon prior request, participants
from the Johannesburg International Airport to RAU on November 30,
between 10.00 and 15.00h. (Please book your trip to Johannesburg so as
to reach RAU campus in time, because there is no regular transport to
the Island.)

On December 5 all participants will be transported back to RAU campus.

ACCOMMODATION: 
The accommodation on the island is somewhat primitive (yet
satisfactory, at least in summer time) and includes a few individual
rooms (which will be reserved for invited lecturers), while the
participants will be accommodated in two large sleeping barracks (for
men and women) each with toilet and shower facilities. The FULL
PACKAGE (transportation by bus-boat between RAU and the Island,
accommodation, 3 meals and refreshments for 5 days) will cost R550
pp. Note that the access between the mainland and the island is by a
special boat only, which can be hired at a cost.

NB: Because of the limited accommodation facilities on the island, the
number of participants in the first part of the school will be
limited, so early registration for that part is essential.

PART II: December 6-10, 1999, RAU campus. The university campus is
situated in Auckland Park, a relatively quiet and safe suburb off the
business center of Johannesburg. It has very good conference
facilities, and the participants will be provided with computers and
access to Internet during this part of the event. For more info about
RAU, visit its Web site at http://www.rau.ac.za.

ARRIVAL AND REGISTRATION: December 5. There will be a Welcome
reception at RAU during and after the registration of that evening.

ACCOMMODATION: 
We offer 3 main options for the accommodation during the 2nd part of
the school:

A) Hotel. The following special rates have been negotiated with
Randburg Towers Hotel (3 star, near Waterfront in Randburg, about 30
min drive to RAU), between which and RAU we shall provide twice daily
bus transport.

	Single rooms: R244 pp/pd, incl. breakfast.  
        Double and twin rooms: R230 per room/pd, excl. breakfast @ R29
	per person.

	All rooms are with bath en suite, aircon, telephone, and TV. 

B) There are limited possibilities for accommodation in guest-houses
within walking distance from the university, offering good, more
intimate environment, with prices ranging from R200-300 pp/pd,
breakfast included. The guest-houses have limited capacities and will
be booked on the basis of first registered - first booked.

C) Student hostels of the University of Witwatersrand (Wits), about
10-15 min drive from RAU. A DAILY PACKAGE of single room, breakfast,
and bus transportation to and from RAU during December 5-10 will cost
R100 pp/pd. In addition, dinners can be booked at the hostels at
R25. The last night for which we have booked the hostels is December
10/11. Those who wish to stay there longer should make their own
arrangements.

For more luxurious accommodation and additional options, check out our
Web-page, but please note that if you choose an accommodation not
listed above, you should make your own booking and transport
arrangements.

Subject: categories: Recursive types in polymorphic lambda calculus
Date: Fri, 14 May 1999 15:24:32 -0400
From: Philip Wadler <wadler@research.bell-labs.com>

There is a fairly standard encoding of recursive types
into polymorphic lambda calculus, given by

	rec X.F[X]  =  all X.(F[X] -> X) -> X

where F[X] is a type in which the type variable X appears only
covariantly.  Recall that every covariant type corresponds to a
covariant functor, so for every h:X->Y we have F[h]:F[X]->F[Y].
If we abbreviate T = rec X.F[X], then the key functions on this
type are given by the polymorphic lambda terms:

	fold : all X.(F[X] -> X) -> T -> X
	fold = Lam X.lam k:F[X]->X.lam t:T.t{X}(k)

	in   : F[T] -> T
	in   = lam u:F[T].Lam X.lam k:F[X]->X.k(F[fold{X}(k)](u))

	out  : T -> F[T]
	out  = fold{F[T]}(F[in])

Questions: Who first had this insight?  Where is a good place to find
this spelled out in the literature?  Please send results to me, and I
will summarize them for the list.  Cheers, -- P

Dear Phil:

    I can give you a bit of the history of the functorial
type approach, as far as I know it.  I will start with recent
history, then mention a few ancient tidbits.

RECENT HISTORY

Syntactically, the fact that for any multisorted finitary algebraic
signature, that the elements of initial algebras can be represented by
closed normal terms of polymorphic type is well-known.  It is implicit in
Girard's Phd thesis (by Curry-Howard), and explicit in Reynolds 1983
paper "Types, abstraction, and parametric polymorphism", as well as in
Bohm-Berarducci "Automatic synthesis of typed \Lambda-programs on term
algebras,  TCS 39 (1985), 135-154.  More recently, of course, one can
look at Girard-Lafont-Taylor, Section 11.5, and also the interesting
discussion in John Mitchell's Foundations for Programming Languages,
MIT Press, 1996, Section 9.3. 

Categorically, the first place I saw the functorial approach published
in detail--and the fact that in System F, \forall p [ T(p) ==> p ==> p ]
is a weakly initial T-algebra  (for definable covariant functors T) is in
Reynolds-Plotkin "On Functors Expressible in the Polymorphic Typed Lambda
Calculus  (Inf. & Computation, 1993, reprinted in  "Logical Foundations
of Functional Programming", edited by G. Huet, Addison-Wesley, 1990).

The second place where this is done in detail is the paper
"Functorial Polymorphism", by Bainbridge, Freyd, Scedrov, and me
(TCS 70 (1990), Subsection 4.9 of  "Reynolds' Parametricity".

A closely related work to the above is by R. Hasegawa, "Categorical data
types in parametric polymorphism, MSCS 4, 1994, pp. 71-109.
 
A basic categorical reference for some of this is Roy Crole's book
"Categories for Types", CUP, Chapter 5.  More advanced remarks on formal
category theory are also in John Mitchell's book, Section 9.3, loc. cit.

Finally, I can recommend a few papers on related material:

Abadi, Cardelli, Curien "Formal parametric polymorphism, TCS 121
(1993), pp. 9-58, 

 Plotkin & Abadi, "A logic for parametric polymorphism"
TLCA'93, SLNCS 664, 1993, pp. 361-375

R. Hasegawa, A logical aspect of parametric polymorphism,
CSL'95, SLNCS 1092, 1995.


PRE-HISTORY:

It's been known since Russell that in higher-order logic (using
quantification over propositional and higher-type variables) that we can
define various propositional connectives, and can even form a version of
type theory based on equality.  For example, in Lambek-Scott, our
treatment of Full Impredicative Intuitionistic Type Theory (e.g. Part II,
Chap. 1, p. 129) and type theory based on Equality (Part II, Chap. 2, p.
133) were inspired not only by Prawitz's 1965 book (Natural Deduction) but
some formulas were literally taken from Russell's 1908 article.

If you then add Curry-Howard to the mixture, assigning proof terms to the
formulas involved, one essentially moves into the modern realm of data
types above.

Certainly the basic ideas have been known (for inductive definitions
of sets) by mathematical loogicians for many years before the
second order lambda calculus was invented.  
I am sure Kleene had a big role here.
I can vouch on the fly for the exact pedigree, but a good
reference for tracking things down is probably Moschovakis's
1974 monograph "elementary indcution on abstact structures"

For the lambda calculus I am not sure who was first, but I
did things independently from scratch in my paper "contracting proofs
to programs" in odifreddi volume "logic and computer science",
academic press 1990.  See in particular chapter 6, but also chapters
5 and 3.

I hope this useful.  let me know if I can help otherwise.
I hope you have my paper above, if not i'll email you 
a source and/or hard copy.

From: Jon Riecke <riecke@research.bell-labs.com>

I'm not exactly sure to whom this is due, but my impression was
that it went back a long way.  Also, isn't parametricity required
to prove that the encoding yields an initial algebra?  

There's some more recent work of Plotkin's that others might not
be aware of: if one takes *linear* polymorphic lambda calculus
with term recursion, plus some modest axioms for parametricity,
one can code up recursive types whose type variable appears with
any variance (covariant, contravariant, or mixed variance).  I can
dig up precise references to his talks on the subject.

Subject: RE: categories: Recursive types in polymorphic lambda calculus

I think this is Reynolds and Plotkin, the first incarnation of
the idea coming from Reynolds. I remember looking into this when
I was a graduate student, but I think it was their idea first.
The idea comes from category theory, or Smyth-Plotkin approach, 
most specifically -- the obvious type for an initial F-algebra
is All t. (F(t) -> t) -> t.

There is some discussion of the origin of the encoding at the
beginning of this paper. I guess special cases of it were known to
Girard (he covers some in Proofs and Types, without history of
course). The case of algebraic signatures (ie T a sum of products) was
worked out in full generality in Bohm & Berarducci (TCS
39(1985)135--154), although the Reynolds-Plotkin paper also refers to
a paper by Leivant in 24th FOCS (1983) for this case. However, the
general case of a definable covariant functor T seems to be down to
Reynolds-Plotkin. I've taken to referring to this general case as the
"Reynolds-Plotkin" lemma when I refer to it in lectures. One important
question is what properties tyhe encoding has. Up to beta conversion,

 rec X.F[X]  =  all X.(F[X] -> X) -> X

gives a weak initial algebra for F. In the presence of relational
parametricity properties, one can deduce that it is actually
initial. Which brings me to the final place in the literature to look
for material on this topic:

Dear Phil,

in a paper at LICS 5, Edumnd Robinson and I use an adaptation of the
usual argument you quote. We assumed that it came from the original
work of Reynolds and Plotkin on non-existence of set-theoretic models
for polymorphic lambda calculus.

Hope this is useful.

Are you thinking of the Bohm-Berarducci coding?  The Bohm-Berarducci coding
types the integers

rec X. (1 + X)

as 

all X. (X->X) -> (X -> X)

which is not far from  all X. ((1 + X) -> X) -> X , depending on how you want
to treat + .  I usually cite Girard-Lafont-Taylor for this.

I'd say algebraic or inductive rather then recursive in this context.
(Though of course, there's a coalgebraic version too, but recursive seems to
imply mixed-variance) I think the usual references for the fact that one can
construct weakly initial algebras for expressible functors are:

C. Bohm and A. Berarducci. Automatic synthesis of typed \Lambda-programs on
term algebras. TCS 39 (1985)

D. Leivant. Reasoning about functional programs and complexity classes
associated with type disciplines. FOCS 24 (1983)

G. Takeuti. Proof Theory. North-Holland studies in logic and the foundations
of mathematics. (1975)

The construction is explained in Proofs and Types (Girard Lafont Taylor, CUP
1989) Chapter 11. The construction gives strongly initial algebras if the
calculus satisfies some parametricity theorems.

I think I first saw the coalgebraic version in something by Gavin Wraith,
but I seem to have misplaced the reference.

Hi Phil:

	I don't know who discovered this, but certainly Reynolds exploited
it in his paper (eventually with Plotkin) "Polymorphism is not
Set-Theoretic".  There he uses F[X] = (X -> 2) -> 2, where X occurs doubly
negatively, hence positively (but not strictly positively).  The argument is
essentially Cantor's diagonal argument, once you get down to it.  The crux
of the issue is that the syntax provides only weakly initial algebras for
definable functors (no uniqueness condition on the mediating morphism),
whereas a set model gives initial algebras, hence we'd have a set isomorphic
to its double powerset, which is impossible.  The key is that Set has enough
equalizers to turn any weakly initial algebra into an initial algebra;
models like Cpo have essentially no equalizers, so they form a valid model.

Dear Philip, 
 
As far as I know, representation in \2 of inductive data types (least 
fixpoints of monotonic operators) like natural numbers 
or lists dates back to the paper of Bohm and Berarducci in
TCS 1985. A generic translation similar to the one you mention
in your types message was probably first given in

H.~Geuvers.
Inductive and coinductive types with iteration and recursion.
In {\em Proceedings of the Workshop on Types for Proofs and
  Programs}, B{\aa}stad, Sweden, 1992, 193--217.

but to my understanding it is implicitly present in 

Leivant, D., Contracting proofs to programs, 
      in: {\it Logic in Computer Science\/} (P.~Odifreddi, ed.),
      Academic  Press, 1990, pp. 279--327.

Let me point out however that there are various definitions
of inductive and recursive types and it is not the case that 
all these are equivalent. In general the systems with "iterators"
can be defined within system F, while those with "recursors" can not. 
A discussion of these issues is given in the PhD Thesis of Zdzislaw
Splawski:

Sp\l awski, Z., {\it Proof-Theoretic Approach to Inductive 
     Definitions in ML-like Programming Language versus Second-Order Lambda 
     Calculus\/}, PhD Thesis, Wroc\l aw University, 1993.

The following paper contains the main results about translatability 
between various systems with inductive types, including the new result
that recursors cannot be implemented within system F by means of beta 
reduction. It should be made available in a few weeks (we will post
an anouncements on types when it is ready).

Splawski, Z., Urzyczyn, P., Type Fixpoints: Iteration versus Recursion, 
            to appear in Proc. 4th ICFP, Paris, France, September 1999. 

Sincerely yours,
Pawel Urzyczyn

Dear Phil,

Well, in fact this is not quite the recursive type you "really" want
since you cannot prove uniqueness of elimination. You just have a weakly
initial solution of your domain equation F(X) = X. So you must e.g. add
an induction principle if you want to prove something. In a dependently
typed calculus (CoC) with an impredicative universe you could even
express the *initial* solution.
Categorically, this goes back to FAFT and the "solution set condition"
where the existence of a left adjoint is related to the existence of
initial objects. If the category of discourse is locally small and
internally complete, then the category has an initial object:
I = { x \in W | forall h \in Hom(W,W). h(p) = p }
where W is the weakly initial object constructed as T above and  "all"
ranges over the set of objects of the category. (this is e.g. discussed
in  Crole's book "Categories for Types", if I remember correctly, and
maybe there one can find more references.)

Type theoretically speaking, you can find the encoding already in Girard
et al.'s "Proofs and Types". Just with the difference that maps k :
F(X)->X are spelled out for concrete examples of F. "Fold" is called
"It" there and "in" is again given in form of several constructors
depending on the concrete form of F. "Out" is obviously a simple
application of "fold" and was not treated there.

I'm not sure that this really is what you are searching for, so if not
-- e.g. if you want to find a reference with "exactly" the formulation
you mentioned --, please accept my excuses.

Regards,
  Bernhard
