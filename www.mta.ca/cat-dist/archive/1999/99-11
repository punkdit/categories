I have finally reorganized my ftp site.  It is at
ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/barr.  There is an Index (The "I" is capitalized so
it is listed first) and it gives the full title and the name of the file.  
All files are given as zipped dvi and zipped ps files.  I will endeavor to
maintain this in this fashion.  In fact, I have attached the Index.

Here's a question I've already asked on the algebraic topology mailing
list. I received several very interesting replies, but there seems to be
little published and I'm curious what else is out there:

I have Thomason's 1980 paper "Cat as a closed model category." Are
there any other references for model category structures on Cat, the
category of small categories?

                          General Information

Geneva is situated along the banks of Lac Leman and Le Rhone.
The lake showcases the plumed fountain Jet d'Eau, and various districts
of Geneva are connected by bridges across the waterways.
The University of Geneva where ICALP '00 will convene is located on the
`Left Bank' off Place Neuve and along the Promenade des Bastions
near the Old Town section of Geneva.

Geneva is a city of water parks and gardens and welcoming walkways
which encourage exploration of the historical sites, museums, and
international business and shopping districts. The University of
Geneva is located near `Old Town' an area dotted with sidewalk
cafes, student life, and building antiquities dating back to the 5th
century.

Geneva is a crossroads situated in the heart of Europe and linked to
the world by a vast network of motorways, airlines and railways. For
those planning to attend ICALP '00 in Geneva, it is an excellent
opportunity to organize short trips into the countryside of charming
villages and vineyards. Tours to please all ages and interests are
available including afternoon train excursions, shopping cruises on
Lake Geneva and The Rhone, and bus and cablecar trips in the Alps.
For some, the most inviting attraction will be mouintain climbing.
Mont Blanc, one of the highest points in Europe and the city of Chamonix

are less than an hour away.


Accomodations at a very special ICALP rate have been reserved in a
couple of hotels and very inexpensive rooms will be available at
the Student Housing.  Lunch will be served daily on campus
and there will be morning and afternoon refreshment breaks.
Note that the specially  priced hotel accommodations reserved
for ICALP participants are located only a 5-10 minute walk to
the campus.

    Master of Science (MSc) degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

    The Division of Informatics offers three 1 year courses
    in different topics in Informatics:


        1. MSc in Artificial Intelligence, whose primary focus is on
        development and understanding of intelligent computational processes
        for the benefit of both creating useful artifacts and helping better
        understand intelligence (human or otherwise). The course contains
        five themes: Foundations of AI, Intelligent Robotics, Knowledge-based
        Systems, Natural Language Processing, and Non-Symbolic AI.

        2. MSc in Cognitive Science and Natural Language. This MSc is
        concerned with computational, formal and experimental approaches
        to understanding cognition and natural language. In Cognitive Science,
        the disciplines of formal linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and
        philosophy are brought together in different kinds of computational
        frameworks. This MSc is particularly concerned with how language is
        represented and processed.
     
        3. The MSc in Computer Science contains three themes. The Advanced
        Computer Systems theme embraces the theory and practice of designing
        programmable systems. The Systems Level Integration theme teaches
        the principles underlying the design of integrated software and
        hardware systems in silicon. The Theoretical Computer Science theme
        introduces students to core areas of theoretical Computer Science and
        to the technologies through which theory-based tools are implemented.
    
    Applicants should specify which course(s) they are applying for and
    which themes are of interest in order of priority.
    
    From October to April students attend taught modules.
    During the period May - September inclusive, each student
    undertakes a major practical project, theoretical dissertation or 
    piece of experimental research under the supervision of a
    member of academic staff. The projects can involve industrial 
    collaboration and may be proposed by the student.

    Together, the three courses receive over 40 studentships from the
    UK government, which support about 1/2 of the students on the courses.

    In general, students should have a good BS/BSc degree (or equivalent)
    in an appropriate topic, plus other skills appropriate to the particular
    MSc course.

    PhD degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

In 1998, the University of Edinburgh established a Division of
Informatics, to study the structure, behaviour and
interactions of both natural and artificial computational systems.
The Division reflects the University's vision of Informatics
as a fundamental area of study, critical for the future developments
in science, engineering, and society. The Division was formed from
the former Departments of Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive
Science and Computer Science.

The Division has positions for new research degree students pursing
either an MSc(Research) (one year), an MPhil (two years) or a PhD
(three years) through investigation of open problems in Informatics.

The Division now contains about 70 academic staff, 60 contract researchers
and 150 research students, grouped primarily into these research
institutes:

        Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute
        Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation
        Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems

	Take cartesian closed categories in the sense: having products, and
internal homs. If there is a natural number object you can define addition
NxN-->N with the usual recursion

		0+n = n          sm+n = s(n+m)

But can you prove it is commutative? You can prove 0+n=n+0 because you can
prove both = n. And you can prove each case of commutativity for "standard
natural numbers" in the sense of global elements sss..ss0 gotten from 0 by
(externally) finitely many applications of successor. 

	But even if I also assume equalizers, I do not see how to prove
commutativity for arbitrary global elements, let alone all generalized
elements. I suspect there are counterexamples but I cannot give one.

	I wonder if this is in Lambek and Scott, but my copy is at the office and
I will not be there until Monday so I am writing in to ask.

best, Colin

Colin's question is a good one.

Associativity tells us that  \x.1+x  and  \x.x+1  commute and that's
enough -- using the defining universal property of the NNO -- to make
them equal: each is a solution to the equations  f(0) = 1  and
f(s(x)) = s(f(x)).

The most conceptual way I can think of to finish the argument is to
use that fact that the NNO (in a locos) is the free monoid on a single
generator. The opposite-monoid functor is an involution on the
category of monoids, hence the opposite monoid, ONN, of NNO is also
free. (ONN has the same underlying object as NNO, but with the twisted
binary operation.) We need only verify that the unique monoid map
g:NNO -> ONN  is the identity. Whatever it is, it is satisfies the
equations  g(0) = 0  and  g(x+1) = 1+g(x). And that's enough to
force it to be identity.

	Todd Wilson answered my query by politely pointing out the obvious--
that the function g:N-->N^N with g(m) = (lambda n)(sn+m) is defined by the
same induction on NxN as the function g':N-->NxN with g'(m) = (lambda
m)(m+sn). Namely, g(0) = successor, and gs = sg. And so the function
h:N-->N^N with h(m) = (lambda n)(m+n) is defined by the same induction as
h'(m)=(lambda n)(n+m), namely h(0)= 1_N and hs=sh.

	I'm afraid I manufactured a difficulty by focussing on Cartesian Closed
categories as "less than toposes" rather than thinking of them in their own
terms--so the "Peano axiom" kind of proof I was looking for is unavailable,
but no problem.

*****************************************************************


Static Analysis  is  increasingly  recognized  as  a  fundamental
technique  for  high performance implementations and verification
systems of high-level  programming  languages.    The  series  of
Static  Analysis  Symposia  has  served  as the primary venue for
presentation of advances in the  area.   Previous  symposia  were
held in Venice, Pisa, Paris, Aachen, Glasgow, and Namur.

The Seventh International  Static  Analysis  Symposium  (SAS2000)
will  be  at  the  same location as and immediately following the
IEEE  Logic  in  Computer  Science  Conference   (LICS2000;   see
http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/libkin/lics/).  Both LICS and SAS
will be held at  the  Conference  Center  of  the  University  of
California,  Santa  Barbara,  which is situated on the beaches of
the Pacific Ocean (see http://www.ucsb.edu/).  

The  technical  program  for  SAS2000  will  consist  of  invited
lectures,   presentations   of   refereed  papers,  and  software
demonstrations.  Contributions are  welcome  on  all  aspects  of
Static Analysis, including, but not limited to:

    abstract interpretation          data flow analysis 
    complexity analysis              theoretical frameworks  
    optimizing compilers             verification Systems    
    program specialization           type inference          
    model checking                   abstract domains.

Submissions  can  address  any  programming  paradigm,  including
concurrent,   constraint,   functional,   imperative,  logic  and
object-oriented programming.  Survey  papers  that  present  some
aspect of the above topics with a new coherence are also welcome.

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers  that
have  been  published  or  that are simultaneously submitted to a
journal or a conference with a refereed proceedings.

Submitted papers must be written in  English  and  print  on  USA
8.5x11-inch  paper.   Papers should be at most 15 pages excluding
the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and at most 25 pages
total.   Papers  should  use  at  least  an 11-point font, single
column format,  and  reasonable  margins  on  8.5x11-inch  paper.
Program   committee   members   are  not  required  to  read  any
appendices, and so a paper should be intelligible without them.

Submitted papers must on the first page   contain  an   abstract,
and  postal  and electronic mailing addresses for at least one of
the authors.  Submissions should arrive  by  January  15,   2000.
All  submissions  must  be done electronically; details of how to
submit a paper will be announced later.

Authors will be notified of the acceptance or rejection of  their
papers  by  March 13, 2000. Final versions of the accepted papers
must be received in camera-ready form by  April  10,  2000.   The
proceedings  are  expected  to be published by Springer-Verlag in
the LNCS series.

Dear All,

Some time ago I discussed with Tony Bak, who is managing editor of the journal
K-theory, those parts of the category theoretic panoply that might fit best
within that journal. Those of you who know the journal will have noted that  it
published Tamsamani's work on weak multiple categories and  that the links
between K-theory and, for instance, categorical treatments of abstract homotopy
theory, the homotopy theory of small categories,  stacks of
groupoids, Topological Quantum Field Theories etc, tensor categories and
results on the representation theory of objects such as quantum groups, Hopf
algebras and so on, are all within the range of topics previously handled by
the journal. 

I have become a member of the editorial board and have been asked to solicit
submissions of good quality papers within these areas.  I would ask that not
withstanding the great relevance of parts of these areas to the readership of
the journal, that any papers submitted to me should be in accordance with
the published publication policy of the journal as printed in  any copy of the
journal.

I look forward to seeing some excellent article coming this way,

	It is with great regret that we have to inform you that our friend
and colleague Ugo Berni Canani died recently in Rome, just after his
sixtieth birthday.  Those of you who met Ugo will remember his warmth and
intelligence and breadth of learning.
	He was a justice of the Italian supreme court in the section 
charged with judging lower courts with respect to their
uniformity of legal procedure (in Italy this section of the supreme
court provides an additional avenue of appeal in that if a lower
court decision is quashed by it, the case is tried again with regard
to the facts by another lower court.) Ugo not only strove to compose
the decisions of this court with the structure of mathematical theorems,
but successfully took on the enormous task of designing and directing
Italy's legal electronic database, which provides access to precedents
from all the courts (this electronic system is considered by
international experts to be the most advanced in the world). The
classifying and organizing required by this database raised new
practical and theoretical issues of linguistics and philosophy to which he
applied his studies of mathematics.
	That work, as well as his lifelong interest in philosophy,
inspired
Ugo over the last twenty years to pursue research in category theory, in
which he was co-author of several papers.  He had dreamed of a future in
which he could devote his time to categorical research.  It is a great
loss that his work has been cut short, but his inspiration to young
Italian philosophers and mathematicians, and to his friends worldwide,
lives on beside his polished legal documents and his legal database as
part of his legacy.
	Ugo leaves us with the memory of a man gifted with lucid and
penetrating intelligence, with many interests pursued with creativity,
youthful curiosity, and simplicity.  We will miss his enthusiasm, his
tireless encouragement, and his warm friendship.

I met him for the first and only time one year ago. I had the pleasure
of sitting next to him at a conference dinner, and it did not take long
to realize I had met a most remarkable man.

                              CL2000

        First International Conference on Computational Logic
        Imperial College, London, UK, 24th to 29th July, 2000
                  http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/cl2000/

                   CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

CL2000 is the first conference in a major new series of annual
international conferences bringing together the various communities of
researchers who have a common interest in Computational Logic.

CL2000 includes seven streams covering various subfields of
computational logic. DOOD2000 (6th International Conference on Rules
and Objects in Databases) and LOPSTR2000 (10th International Workshop
on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformation) will be streams
within CL2000. Moreover, the International Conference on Logic
Programming (ICLP) is now integrated into CL2000.  ILP2000 (10th
International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming) is also
collocated with CL2000.

The organisation of CL2000 will provide facilities for half-day and
one-day workshops, to be held on Saturday July 29th.

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for
workshops on topics in computational logic.
Anyone wishing to organise a workshop should send (possibly by email,
in text or html format) a proposal no longer than two pages to the
workshop coordinator by 

               December 20, 1999  

The proposal should describe the topic of the proposed workshop and 
its relevance to computational logic. Besides the contact information 
and the list of the organisers, the proposal should contain - when 
applicable - the following information:

- proposed duration of the workshop (half day/one day),
- description of previously organised similar workshops, 
- expected number of participants,
- character of the workshop (formal/informal, via
  submission/invitation),
- plans for publication of the proceedings.

The workshop organisers will be responsible for maintaining a
homepage, and for producing one hard copy of the proceedings in A4 or
US-letter format. Organisers who whish to use a format different than
A4 or US-letter are expected to produce the needed copies of
proceedings as well.

Proposals will be evaluated by the program committee and decisions
will be made by January 10, 2000. Further information about the
arrangements for workshops can be obtained from the workshop coordinator.

             Presheaf Models for CCS-like Languages

Abstract
=========

The aim of this paper is to harness the mathematical machinery around 
presheaves for the purposes of process calculi. Joyal, Nielsen and Winskel 
proposed a general definition of bisimulation from open maps. Here we show 
that open-map bisimulations within a range of presheaf models are congruences 
for a general process language, in which CCS and related languages are easily 
encoded. The results are then transferred to traditional models for processes. 
By first establishing the congruence results for presheaf models, abstract, 
general proofs of congruence properties can be provided and the awkwardness 
caused through traditional models not always possessing the cartesian 
liftings, used in the break-down of process operations, are side-stepped. The 
abstract results are applied to show that hereditary history-preserving 
bisimulation is a congruence for CCS-like languages to which is added a 
refinement operator on event structures as proposed by van Glabbeek and Goltz.

The preprint "From coherent structures to universal properties"
is available from 

http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/u/hermida


under coh-univ.ps

Abstract: Given a 2-category K admitting a calculus of bimodules, and a
2-monad T on it compatible with such calculus, we construct a 2-category
L with a 2-monad S on it such that: i) S has the adjoint-pseudo-algebra
property. 

ii) The 2-categories of pseudo-algebras of S and T are equivalent.

     Thus, coherent structures (pseudo-T-algebras) are transformed into
universally characterised ones (adjoint-pseudo-S-algebras). The
2-category L consists of lax algebras for the pseudo-monad induced by T
on the bicategory of bimodules of K. We give an intrinsic
characterisation of pseudo-S-algebras in terms of {\em
representability\/}. Two major consequences of the above transformation
are the classifications of lax and strong morphisms, with the attendant
coherence result for pseudo-algebras. We apply the theory in the context
of internal categories and examine monoidal and monoidal globular
categories (including their {\em monoid classifiers\/}) as well as
pseudo-functors into Cat.

 Participants in this past summer's Coimbra meetings may be interested to
learn that the photographs my wife snapped there have now (like those of
April in Buffalo) been incorporated into another "This is Us" volume:
"Symposium -- Celebrating [with] Saunders." 

 Same format as "This is Us, Vol. 1: Doing Math -- Category Theorists at
Buffalo," and same price, yet with even more pictures (170 pp. vs. 108
pp.).  Using less costly paper and a more economical printing technique
helped keep expenses -- and hence price -- about the same; fortunately,
with no appreciable degradation of image quality. 

 Pre-publication mock-ups got shown around last month, at the University
of Chicago's own Saunders' Birthday Party, and at the McGill OktoberFest;
thanks to all whom these tempted into placing early orders, publication
was completed on November 1, in the very constructive sense that on that
date we mailed out all copies ordered in October, and that all orders
arriving since then have seen same-day fulfillment. 

 Further copies of both books can now be produced upon demand, as can also
custom enlargements of individual photos.  For details, please use the
address in the .sig below. 
 
 Cheers (and thanks for forgiving this commercial intrusion upon your time),

Objectives

Object-based Distributed Computing is being established as the most
pertinent basis for the support of large, heterogeneous computing and
telecommunications systems. Indeed, several important international
organisations, such as ITU, ISO, OMG, TINA-C, etc. are defining similar
distributed object-based frameworks as a foundation for open distributed
computing.

The advent of Open Object-based Distributed Systems - OODS - brings new
challenges and opportunities for the use and development of formal methods.
New architectures and system models are emerging (e.g., the enterprise,
information, computational and engineering viewpoints of the ITU-T/ISO/IEC
ODP Reference Model) which require formal notational support. Usual design
issues such as specification, verification, refinement, and testing need to
take into account new dimensions introduced by distribution and openness,
such as quality of service and dependability constraints, dynamic binding
and reconfiguration, consistency between multiple models and viewpoints,
etc. OODS is a challenging research context and a source of motivation for
semantical models of object-based systems and notations, for the evolution
of standardised formal description techniques, for the application and
assessment of logic based approaches, for better understanding and
information modeling of business requirements, and for the further
development and use of Object Oriented methodologies and tools.

The objective of FMOODS is to provide an integrated forum for the
presentation of research in several related fields, and the exchange of
ideas and experiences in the topics concerned with the formal methods
support for Open Object-based Distributed Systems.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

   * formal models for object-based distributed computing
   * semantics of object-based distributed systems and programming languages
   * formal techniques in object-based and object-oriented specification,
     analysis and design
   * refinement and transformation of specifications
   * types, service types and subtyping
   * interoperability and composability of distributed services
   * object-based coordination languages
   * object-based mobile languages
   * efficient analysis techniques of specifications
   * multiple viewpoint modelling and consistency between different models
   * formal techniques in distributed systems verification and testing
   * specification, verification and testing of quality of service
     constraints
   * formal methods and object life cycle
   * beyond IDL: semantics based specification patterns
   * formal models for measuring the quality of object-oriented requirement
     or design specifications
   * formal aspects of distributed real-time multimedia systems
   * applications to telecommunications and related areas

Call for Admission and Grant Applications

This is a call for admission and  grant applications from students to BRICS
International PhD   School in Computer  Science   at University  of Aarhus,
Denmark.  The  call  is  aimed   at students  starting  August  2000,  with
application deadline January 31st, 2000.

BRICS  International PhD School is an  integrated part  of the BRICS (Basic
Research in Computer Science) Research  Centre, and both  are funded by the
Danish National Research  Foundation. The   school admits 10-15    students
(Danish and   foreign) annually, and  it provides   a substantial number of
student grants.

The core areas of  the PhD School  are: Semantics of Computation; Logic  in
Computer   Science;  Computational   Complexity;  Design  and  Analysis  of
Algorithms; Programming Languages; Distributed Computing; Verification; and
Data Security and Cryptology.

The PhD school will  provide its students with  a  solid background in  the
theoretical  foundation  of  computer science,  and  centred  around  BRICS
activities. From  this foundation, the  students may either continue in one
of  the core areas or venture into  areas of a more applied or experimental
nature as possible areas of thesis specialisation.

The PhD School wishes to recruit PhD students  of the highest international
standards.  It provides an   excellent research environment  and scientific
training facilities, and aims at making its  PhD graduates attractive for a
wide spectrum of employers - in private and public research and development
institutions, both in Denmark and abroad.

So, if you are a student with at least four years of full-time study by the
summer of 2000,   highly motivated and well   prepared for a   PhD study in
computer  science within a  truly international environment, please send us
an application  following the instructions below.  For more details, please
visit
                           http://www.brics.dk,

or contact us by e-mail at phdschool@brics.dk.

Also,  we would appreciate your  passing on this  information to interested
students and colleagues at your university or research institute.


BRICS

The Research Centre BRICS (Basic  Research In Computer Science) was founded
in 1994  by the Danish National Research  Foundation at the Universities of
Aarhus and Aalborg.  BRICS is a centre of  basic research  in Algorithmics,
Logic and Semantics, and has a  scientific staff of  30 (permanent and long
term visitors), and around 100 short term visitors annually.


Admission Prerequisites and Study Structure

Admission is based  on knowledge corresponding  to four years of  full-time
studies, including basic courses in  programming and programming languages,
computer   systems, algorithms    and data  structures,  computability  and
mathematics (this list will be interpreted in a flexible way).

The time allocated for the  PhD studies is a  further four years, where the
first  two  years  include some   mandatory course  work   and introductory
research, concluded by a qualifying examination, whereas the last two years
are dedicated to  the writing of the  thesis, finishing with a defence. All
students admitted to the  school will enter  this study structure. We  may,
however, take into account merits from previous study.

Students  are  normally  admitted   for the  semester  start September 1st.
--- but admission may  take place throughout  the year.


PhD Student Grants

The school offers student grants of different types:

1. tuition waiver and full studentship
2. tuition waiver and partial studentship
3. tuition waiver

Only a limited amount of type 1. grants are available.

It turns out, as Fred Linton kindly let me know just after I posted
this, that Eilenberg developed such an account to general function
spaces in topology.  Yesterday I got a copy of Eilenberg's manuscript
(in the literal sense of manuscript) that Fred Linton sent me, which I
read with pleasure. Apparently this will be eventually published. It
was written around 1985. So, after all, there is (going to be) such a
development available in the literature.

The methods that both papers use are the same, and are due to Fox,
Arens, Dugundji, Day and Kelly, Scott, and Isbell (although we combine
them in different ways). These references and most of these methods
are discussed in a paper on function spaces published by Isbell in
1985.

The "7th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation"
(WoLLIC'2000), the seventh version of a series of workshops which started
in 1994 with the aim of fostering interdisciplinary research in pure and
applied logic, will be held in Natal, Brazil, from August 15th to 18th 2000.
Contributions are invited in the form of short papers (10 A4 10pt pages) in
all areas related to logic, language, information and computation, including:
pure logical systems, proof theory, model theory, algebraic logic, type theory,

THE LOCATION
Natal is the capital and largest city of Rio Grande do Norte, a sun shiny
land of beaches, dunes, coconut trees, located in north-east coast of Brazil.
There, the summer takes all year long (sun shines more than 300 days per
year), and the heat is softened by a constant breeze. Along the 400-kilometer
(250-mile) coast line, calm beaches with reefs forming natural pools altern
with good surfing spots, almost untouched places full of sand dunes and
coconut trees. 

GUEST SPEAKERS
There will be a number of guest speakers, including:
Andrea Asperti (Univ Bologna, Italy)
Maria Luisa Bonet (Univ Politecnica Catalunya, Spain) (*)
Martin Hyland (Cambridge Univ, UK) (*)
Angus Macintyre (Edinburgh Univ, Scotland)
Luiz Carlos Pereira (Pontificial Catholic Univ of Rio, Brazil)
Bruno Poizat (Univ Lyon I, France) (*)
Glynn Winskel (BRICS, Denmark)

 PS: The current pricing of the two "This is Us" volumes, the new
 "Symposium -- Celebrating [with] Saunders," as well as the older
 "Doing Math -- Category Theorists at Buffalo," still remains at
 $25 per copy, postpaid (but the state of CT requires residents 
 thereof to pay an additional $1.50 per copy, as 6% CT sales tax).

 Alas, once  amazon.com  and  BarnesandNoble.com  undertake 
 distribution, these books' new official list prices will rise, to $34.95.
 [On the bright side, both .com operations take credit card payments,
 which The Lintons' Video Press cannot.  Anyway, caveat emptor.]

RESEARCH POST IN THE DEPT. OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF MILAN

Applications are invited for a research post within
the framework of the "Principled Hybrid Systems:
Theory and Applications" (PHYSTA) research network.
The network is funded by the Training and Mobility of
Researchers programme (TMR) of the EC and has started
in December 1997. It involves research groups from five
universities:
  i) King's College London, United Kingdom
      (Dept. of Mathematics, Prof. J.Taylor)
 ii) Katholic University of Nijmegen, Netherlands
      (Centre for Neural Networks, Prof. Stan Gielen)
iii) National Technical University of Athens, Greece
      (Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
       Prof. Stefanos Kollias)
 iv) University of Milan, Italy
       (Department of Computer Science, Prof. Bruno Apolloni)
  v) Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom
       (Dept. of Psychology/English, Prof. Rodie Cowie)

The aim of the research network is the development of
a theory and a methodology for combining symbolic and
sub-symbolic techniques. The problem domain which is
used comes from HCI and refers to emotion understanding
based on static/moving image and speech signals.

The research post is available in the Neural Networks
Laboratory of the Computer Science Department of the
University of Milan. The post is available immediately
for a period of 18 months.

The successful applicant will work for the continuation
of the development of a hybrid system prototype which
has been implemented. This is a system combining a neural processing
part which performs a mapping from the feature to the
propositional variables space and a symbolic processing part.
The latter is a series of meditation jumps to higher levels
of abstraction following a PAC learning framework for boolean
formulas.

Candidates must have (or be close to obtaining) a PhD in a field
such as Computer Science, Mathematics or Electrical Engineering.
C programming skills are necessary while experience using SNNS
and Scheme/Lisp programming skills are welcome.

As the funding is provided by the EC TMR programme there are some
restrictions on who may benefit from it:

   * Candidates must be 35 years old or younger.
   * Candidates must be nationals of a EU country, Norway, Switzerland
     or Iceland
   * Candidates must not be Italian nationals or have worked in Italy 18
     out of the last 24 months.

The salary for this post is approximately 2,100 Euros.

To apply for this post please (e)mail your CV to the address below:

     Professor Bruno Apolloni,
     Neural Networks Laboratory
     Computer Science Department
     University of Milan,
     Via Comelico 39, Milano 20135, ITALY
