                       Second Call For Papers
            http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~eric/cp99-rtc/

                   A Post-Conference Workshop of
     the 5th International Conference on Principles and Practice
                 of Constraint Programming (CP'99)

            October 16, 1999, Alexandra, Virginia, USA

A CP'99 post-conference international workshop on REAL-TIME CONSTRAINTS is 
being organized at CP'99. Real-time systems and applications all require 
stringent timing constraints for correct operation. Such real-time constraints 
are often difficult to design as well as verify. Varied techniques that deal
with real-time constraints have been proposed in various application domains.
This workshop will try to find a consensus in the various techniques that
appear in different domains related to real-time constraint specification, 
programming, design, validation, and verification.

All topics related to real-time constraints are invited. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Specification of Real-Time Constraints   - Formal Methods
- Modeling of Real-Time Constraints        - Industrial Techniques
- Programming of Real-Time Constraints     - Case Studies
- Verification of Real-Time Constraints    - IP / Virtual Components
- Testing of Real-Time Constraints         - Embedded Systems
- Real-Time Constraint Tools               - Hardware-Software Coverification

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS: 
To submit a paper to the workshop, please do the following:
(1) Prepare a manuscript in either PDF or PostScript format. Manuscripts 
    should be already in camera-ready format: a maximum of 6 pages (A4 or 
    letter), font size 10 pt or 11 pt, single-spaced, double-column, with
    the first page including paper title, author names, affiliations, e-mail
    addresses, a maximum 200-word abstract, and at least 5 keywords.
(2) Prepare a cover letter (an ascii-text e-mail) with the paper title,
    the corresponding author's name, mailing address, e-mail address, 
    and telephone/fax numbers, paper abstract, and keywords.

Greetings:

I have finally established a mailing list for universal algebra.  (I have
been thinking about doing this for a long time.  At one time, I was going
to establish a mailing list for Beck modules, and a fair number of people on
this list expressed interest.)  The mailing list is at the onelist.com web
facility.

It is a moderated mailing list, for now, with me as the only moderator for
the time being.  (My policy will be that anything that isn't spam or harmful
to someone else will be accepted.)

To subscribe, you can register for the univalg list at on the web at
http://www.onelist.com, or send e-mail to univalg-subscribe@onelist.com.
Onelist.com may then ask you to confirm your subscription by e-mail.  To
submit a message to the list, either post it using the facilities at the
web site, or send it to univalg@onelist.com.

If you have any problems doing any of this, please send me e-mail at 
rowan@crl.com.

The mailing list is set up so that replies to messages go out to the
whole list.  So, please bear this in mind.  If for some reason you subscribe,
and then change your mind, you can unsubscribe at the web site or send
e-mail to univalg-unsubscribe@onelist.com.

Subject: categories: monadic completion of adjunctions
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk

		MONADIC COMPLETION OF ADJUNCTIONS

A famous theorem of Jon Beck says that an adjunction
			A
		      ^    |
		      |    |
		    F | -| | U
		      |    |
		      |    v
			C

is monadic (equivalent to its category of Eilenberg--Moore algebras)
iff U satisfies a certain condition involving "U-split coequalisers".

Given any adjunction, of course one may "force" it to be monadic by
replacing the category A by the category of algebras for the monad U.F,
and there is a comparison functor.


(1) My question is this: is there an explicit account in the literature
somewhere of the construction obtained by "freely adding" the conditions
of Beck's theorem (the U-split coequalisers) to A?


(2) Further, has anyone considered what happens when one forces an adjunction
to be BOTH monadic and comonadic?

Steve Lack gave me a verbal answer to the second question, although he
hasn't shown me his notes:
(a) if we force U to be monadic, and then (the new) F to be comonadic,
    (the third) U need NOT be monadic, but
(b) if we force U to be monadic again then (the fourth) F IS still comonadic.


In my investigation of this question and similar ones that have arisen
from my abstract Stone duality programme, I have found a construction 
due to Hayo Thielecke very useful,  though it seems appropriate to 
generalise it considerably beyond either his or my interests:

(3) Given an adjunction, or just the functor U, above, let H (for Hayo) be
the category with
   objects:     those of A
   morphisms:   H(a, b) = C(Ua, Ub)
Does anyone have an account of this category, maybe in the even more abstract
framework of a 2-category?


(4) The usefulness of the category H is that it provides a framework in
which to lift an endofunctor  S:A->A  to  the category of algebras, so
long as T has a "de Morgan dual"   P:C->C such that  U.S=P.U.   For example
if S is (- x a) for some object a in A,  or (which is what interests both
Hayo and me) if U is  Sigma^-: C^op -> C^op   and S is  (- x c), or
the same situation with a symmetric monoidal (closed) structure.


Making use of the construction of H, my sketch solution to question (2)
is as follows:

(i) As wide or lluf subcategories (all objects, some morphisms) of H we find
the categories that freely make U faithful (f), or faithful and reflect
invertibility (fri - this is the usage of "faithful" in Freyd & Scedrov);
call these A_f and A_fri.

(ii) F-|U extends to left adjoints
        F_f -| U_f : A_f -> C    and    F_fri -| U_fri : A_fri -> C
and if F was faithful or fri then so is F_f or F_fri.

(iii) Therefore the processes of making U and F faithful (or fri) commute,
so we need only do each of them once.

(iv) The auxillary category H is also convenient for representing freely
adjoined U-split coequalisers, in a similar way to the "Karoubi completion"
of a category to one with splittings of idempotents, but it's too messy
to describe in this note.

(v) Freely adding U-split coequalisers
    - commutes with freely forcing U (and F) to be faithful, and
    - commutes with freely adding F-split equalisers, and
    - preserves the properties that U or F are faithful or fri, but
    - DOES NOT COMMUTE with freely forcing U to reflect isomorphisms, and
    - DOES NOT COMMUTE with freely forcing F to reflect isomorphisms.

(vi) This justifies Steve Lack's claims. (I have counterexamples in (v),
though not actually to support (2a).)   Resolving the construction of
the monadic reflection of U (and the comonadic reflection of F) into
forcing them to be fri and then to have split co/equalisers, we find that
there is just one obstacle to the commutation of the four operations,
but this is overcome by a single repetition as in (2b).

Recently there was brought up the question whether duals of ccc's may have
significance and it has been pointed out by P. Levy and P. Selinger that a 
good example is that of the Kleisli category for the continuation monad.

In a sense the dual of the Kleisli category is much neater as it is cc.
There is some ``odd'' structure there corresponding to some sort of
``classical disjunction''. It is precisely this ``odd'' structure which is
used for constructing ``function spaces'' in the Kleisli category which, 
however, aren't exponentials.
Actually, there can't exist proper function spaces for the following reason. 
If C and its dual are both cartesian closed then C is a bi-Heyting algebra
as if C^op is cc then 1+(_) is a right adjoint and accordingly 1+1 ~= 1
form which it follows that C is posetal. This strengthens ``Joyal's Lemma''
saying that any c.c. with an involution is actually a Boolean algebra.

Dear Categorists,

I wish to label the following notion of (for lack of a better term)
"generalized subfunctor" of a functor H: J ---> C in a manner that is
consistent with the categorical community.  What I call a "generalized
subfunctor" of F is a category D, a pair of functors F: C --->D and G: J
---> D, and a monic natural transformation m: G ---> FoH.  My motivation
is to formulate the notion of "generically creating a generalized
subfunctor" to such a functor H.

Is there some standard alternative to the overloaded term
"generalized"?  By the way, I am somewhat interested in the case where H
sends certain J-spans to product diagrams in C, so sketch-theoretic
ideas are certainly welcome.

Best Regards,
  Bob McGrail

There are two research positions in computer science available at ETL
Semantics Group in Osaka, Japan.

One position, for a postdoctoral fellow, starts in November 1999 and runs
until the end of March 2001.  We seek for an excellent researcher who
works in the field of refinement, semantics of reactive programs,
or program verification.

Another short-term visiting position, which is not only for
postdoctoroal fellows but open to any level, is also available for a
visit for one or two months anytime during term time from October until
the end of March 2000.

ETL (Electrotechnical Laboratory) is one of Japan's governmental
research institutes.  The current positions are supported by a COE
(Centre Of Excellence) project funded by STA (Science and Technology
Agency) under the theme "Global Information Processing Technology."
It is a big project with  an annual budget of 350,000,000 yen
(ca. 3,500,000 dollars,) but our small subgroup is working on
semantics of refinement and program verification.  For more info, see
our home page "http://www.etl.go.jp/etl/etlclu/~sem/" or send an
e-mail to Dr. Kinoshita.

An applicant should send his/her CV to the address below by Friday
10 September 1999; sending a postscript or PDF file via e-mail would
be preferred, but a paper copy would also do.  The applicant may
receive a request for one or two referee reports later on.

The 1999 Annual Conference of the European Association for Computer
Science Logic follows previous CSL Conferences:
   CSL'98 (Brno, Czech Republic), CSL'97 (Aarhus, Denmark),
   CSL'96 (Utrecht, The Netherlands), CSL'95 (Paderborn, Germany),
   CSL'94 (Kazimierz, Poland), CSL'93 (Swansea, United Kingdom),
   CSL'92(San Miniato, Italy), CSL'91 (Berne, Switzerland),
   CSL'90 (Heidelberg, Germany), CSL'89 (Kaiserslautern, Germany),
   CSL'88 (Duisburg, Germany), and CSL'87 (Karlsruhe, Germany).
CSL'99 will be held in Madrid (Spain). The event is
organized jointly by the Computer Science Departments
(DSIP and DACYA) of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The scientific program includes 34 selected papers from among 91
submissions, five invited lectures, and two tutorials on theorem
proving and rewriting techniques, scheduled on September 24
afternoon (Friday) and September 25 morning (Saturday), immediately
after the main conference.

In addition to the scientific program, the social program includes
an excursion to Segovia (a nearby historic city), and a conference
dinner. Madrid offers the opportunity to enjoy both Spain and one of
the most attractive capitals in Europe.

In this document you can find the Invited Lecturers, Tutorials,
Scientific Programme, General Information, Registration and
Accommodation Information. The CSL'99 Web page

Some of you may have experienced difficulties getting to web pages on
triples lately.  There have been security problems at McGill of late,
and all "access" from the outside is being severely limited.  For the
time being (and perhaps permanently), all urls of the form
   http://triples.math.mcgill.ca/<whatever>
can be accessed using the form
   http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/<whatever>

In particular, the Category center page is now 
   http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples

The "www.math.mcgill.ca/triples" format will probably become
permanent, but we hope to have the older "triples.math.mcgill.ca"
format operational again soon (so old bookmarks and links will
function again).  We shall see...

 - all the best, Robert 

PS:
We are trying to find a method that will make the above translation
automatically, without user intervention, and (here is the hard bit)
without any actual access to an http server on triples.  If you have
any technical comments on how to do this (or if it is indeed
impossible), let us know please.

This is a copy of a notice sent out early in the summer - I gather
some folks missed it then and so here is a duplicate.  (Technically,
this is still the "first" announcement, though ;-))

                       Category Theory OctoberFest

                       McGill University, Montreal
                 Saturday - Sunday, October 16 - 17, 1999

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We invite you to join us in Montreal next October for a weekend meeting
in Category Theory, the "not-quite-annual" OctoberFest. As has been the
tradition with these meetings, we invite talks from all participants. If
you wish to give a talk, send your request along with a short abstract
(before the end of September please) to Robert Seely at the address
below. Early in October the program committee will announce a
preliminary schedule on the Categories email list, and on the CTRC/CRTC
web site. (The URL for which is http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples)
The final schedule will be announced at the meeting.

We will meet in the Bronfman Building, 1001 Sherbrooke West, on Saturday
morning, October 16th. Coffee will be available from 8:30 am. The first
talk will be at 9:00. Registration will take place during the morning,
before the first talk and during the first coffee break.

There will be a registration fee of about $CAN45 (approximately
$US30), with luck, less: all possible attempts will be made to keep
this as low as we can. There will be a student discount. The precise
amount will be announced in early October, along with the proposed
schedule.  There will be a dinner/party to be held Saturday evening,
hosted by Marta Bunge.  (Instructions for getting to the Bunge home
will be announced at the meeting.)  Please let us know if you intend
to join us by sending a short email (before the end of September if
possible) to Robert Seely, also indicating whether or not you will
bring a guest to the party. (We need to have a good estimate of how
many people will attend the party about a week before the meeting.)

Below you will find a list of hotels and tourist rooms close to McGill.
Please note that October is a popular month for visiting Montreal, and
early booking is recommended. If you have any further questions, please
contact one of us.

A colleague in geometric topology has encountered a categorical 
construction for which he would like some literature references.  He has 
asked me to pass this request on to this mailing list.  Roughly speaking, 
the construction takes a category carrying an action by a monoid and forms 
an associated "orbit" category.  However, rather than identifying objects 
in the same orbit, it inserts a canonical isomorphism between them.

Here are the details:

Let M be a monoid which is also a poset.  Assume that the multiplication on 
M preserves the order and that the unit u for the multiplication on M is an 
initial element for the poset.  Think of M as a category with morphisms 
derived from the poset structure.  Let C be any category and let F : M x C 
-> C be a functor which gives an action of M on C.  For each m in M and 
each c in C, there is a map t(m,c) from c to F(m,c) obtained by applying F 
to the poset relation u \leq m and the identity map on c.  Form the 
category of fractions of C in which all the maps t(m,c) have been 
inverted.  Note that it looks somewhat like the orbit category C/M, but 
with the objects in the same orbit linked by canonical isomorphisms 
(derived from the t(m,c)) rather than identified.

Has anyone seen this construction before?  Is there literature on it?

Thanks for any help on this,
Gaunce Lewis

Dear Gaunce Lewis, GT-colleague and all,

When we regard a monoid  M  as a one-object category, an M-set is a functor
X : M --> Set  and the colimit of the functor  X  is the set of orbits of
the M-set.

What GT-colleague has is an ordered monoid which can be regarded as a
one-object 2-category  M,  and the action  F  of  M  on the category  C
amounts to a 2-functor X : M --> Cat.  I suspect that the construction
required is the pseudocolimit of  X.  This kind of colimit for 2-functors
was considered in the book of John Gray

J.W. Gray, Formal Category Theory: Adjointness for 2-Categories,  Lecture
Notes in Math. 391 (Springer, 1974)

and in my paper

Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 8
(1976) 149-181

where I show that pseudo(co)limits and lax (co)limits are ordinary weighted
(= indexed) (co)limits in the sense of enriched category theory (for the
base monoidal category  Cat).

I suspect the condition that the identity element is initial is a red
herring even though this makes it look as though canonical maps are being
inverted rather than isomorphisms being introduced.

Regards,
Ross
