Deutchland), CSL'99 will be held in Madrid (Spain). The event is
organized jointly by the Computer Science Departments (SIP and DACYA)
of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The scientific program includes 34 selected papers from among 91
submissions, five invited lectures, and two tutorials on theorem
proving and rewriting techniques, scheduled on September 24
afternoon (Friday) and September 25 morning (Saturday), immediately
after the main conference.

In addition to the scientific program, the social program includes
an excursion to Segovia (a nearby historic city), and a conference
dinner. Madrid, a city of contrasts, traditional and contemporary at
the same time, offers the opportunity to enjoy both Spain and one of
the most attractive capitals in Europe.

Does anyone help me to figure out what internal sheaf means? I mean, for
any internal category (C0, C1, id, src, tgt, comp), there is a
definition of a internal presheaf (also called category action). If it is, 
I want to know the canonical definition of an internal sheaf.

Thanks in advance,
Hongseok

I am puzzled by an exercise on page 15 of Mac Lane's classic text
"Categories for the Working Mathematician": exercise 5 for section 3
of Chapter I:

  5. Find two different functors T: Grp --> Grp with object function
  T(G) = G the identity for every group G.

One such functor, of course, is the identity on every arrow as well.
So the challenge is to find a functor that leaves all objects
unchanged, but changes around at least some arrows.

There is one easy way to do that, which may well be what Mac Lane had
in mind as the solution to this exercise.  For each group G, we choose
some automorphism of G, say a_G.  We then define our functor T to take
the arrow f: G --> H to the arrow

         (a_H)^(-1) f a_G : G --> H.

This preserves identities and compositions, so it does define a
functor.  But it seems like cheating, in a way.  For one thing, this
new functor is structurally the same as the identity functor.  All
that we've done is to change the scheme by which we name the elements
of the various groups, using the automorphism a_G as our rule for
renaming the elements of G.

Note also that we haven't used any properties of the particular
category Grp.  This renaming technique would work equally well for Ab
or Set.  If renaming was what Mac Lane had in mind, why did he specify
Grp in the exercise?

I've spent some time trying to construct a more interesting solution
to the exercise: a functor from Grp to Grp that leaves objects alone
and transforms arrows in some way that clearly changes the structure.
In particular, I started out hoping to take some non-null arrows to
null arrows.  For example, consider the homomorphism

         h : C_2 --> A_5

from the cyclic group C_2 to the alternating group A_5 that takes the
lone non-identity element of C_2 to the permutation (12)(34).  That
permutation is even, and hence belongs to A_5; and it has order two,
so the map h is a homomorphism.

Initially, I thought that it would be pretty safe for my functor to
map h to the null homomorphism.  Note that A_5 is a simple group, so
any homomorphism from A_5 to any other group has to be either
injective or null -- there are no intermediate possibilities.

But then I thought about situations like the following:

           C_2  --->  C_2 x G

            |            |
            | h          | (h, id)
            V            V

           A_5  <---  A_5 x G

The map on the top line takes t |--> (t, e) where e is the identity of
G, while the map on the bottom line is the projection (s, u) |--> s.

This diagram commutes before I apply my functor, and my functor
presumably leaves the top and bottom arrows alone.  If my functor
takes the h on the left to the null homomorphism, it must also take
the h component of the map (h, id) on the right to null; but it can't
alter the id component of that map.  So my functor has to take some
arrows only partway to the null arrow.  Given an arbitrary arrow, how
far towards the null arrow should my functor take it?  Finding a rule
that works seems hard, even for direct products, not to mention
semi-direct products and non-split extensions.

Is there some interesting solution to this exercise that I am missing?
Or did Mac Lane have the boring, renaming solution in mind?

Thanks,
Lyle Ramshaw

I assume that by "null arrow" you mean what some folks call "the trivial
homomorphism".  

Why not go all the way and consider the functor that leaves objects
alone and maps all arrows to null arrows?

I am afraid that does not work.  You have to take an identity to an
identity.  The suggested conjugation by choosing an automorphism for each
object does that.  It may be the answer Mac Lane had in mind, although
that works for any category, as noted.  I cannot think of any other
example.

At 01:50 PM 7/8/99 -0700, Lyle Ramshaw was 

> ... puzzled by an exercise on page 15 of Mac Lane's classic text ...

I have three remarks to add to this discussion.

The first is more of a confession: for nigh onto thirty years I seem to have
misread this problem, thinking what it sought was a functor  Grp ---> Grp
commuting with the underlying-set functors, like the passage from a group
to its opposite.  I now stand, belatedly, corrected.

Second (and surely others will be chiming in on this point too),
Baez's suggestion to trivialize all homomorphisms can't work -- you can't be
a functor if you trivialize identity maps.

Finally, the sort of example Mac Lane probably had in mind for an exercise
on such an early page as p. 15:  writing   t  for the only non-identity
automorphism (an central involution, actually) of, say, the chosen group  G
= Z 
(or of G = Z/3Z , if you prefer), define  T: Grp ---> Grp as follows:

 T(X) = X ,  whatever the group  X ,  and, for  f: X --> Y  in  Grp ,  set

        + -
        |   f  ,  if either  X = G = Y  or neither  X  nor  Y  is  G ;
 T(f) = |  ft  ,  if only  X = G ;
        |  tf  ,  if only  Y = G .
        + -

(This ASCII graphic works best if you display it in a fixed-width font.)

I'll spare CATEGORIES readers the straightforward details of the checking 
that  T  really is a functor.  But I'll add the aside that there's nothing 
special about the choices of  G  and  t  above, beyond  G  being a group
and  t  being a central, involutive automorphism of  G .  Even "involutive"
isn't really needed, except for the typographical convenience, here in 
ASCII-land, of not having to compose a  " t-inverse "  with  f  in *one*
(but, please, *not* in the other) of the last two lines of the definition 
of  T(f) :-) .

Cheers,

-- Fred [E.J. Linton,  aka <FLinton@Wesleyan.edu>

Peter Freyd has talked, maybe written, about a cartesian closed
non-category.  I have a *-autonomous non-category.  I wonder if this
rings any bells with anyone.  In order to talk about it on this
unforgiving medium, I will use the following notation:	2^X for the
powerset of X, \/ and /\ for union and intersection, resp.  ~Y for the
complement of Y (in X), T for the top and I for the bottom of the
lattice 2^2^X.

Now, the objects of this non-catgory are the upclosed subsets of 2^X.  I
will use a, b, c, ... for upclosed subsets of 2^X and Y, Z, W, ... for
subsets of X. Given a, let a* denote the { Y | ~Y is in ~a }. So Y is in
a* iff the complement of Y is not in X. These Y can also be
characterized as meeting every set in a (which is obviously upclosed).
It is the case that a** = a. Moreover, if we define a --o b = a* \/ b,
we get something like an internal hom.	What about composition?  Well,
first, what about identities.  The sets of the form a --o a = a* \/ a
are characterized by the property that for any Y, either Y or ~Y is in
it.  That is, a* \/ a has this property and if b has this property, then
b contains b*, so b = b* \/ b. It is not hard to show that (a \/ b)* =
a* /\ b* and vice versa, so that the tensor product should be /\.  The
unit for the tensor product is thus T, so there wants to be a map T -->
a as soon as for each Y, either Y or ~Y is in a. Let me call such a set
large.	An interesting observation is that ((a --o b) /\ (b --o c)) --o
(a --o c) is large, so it looks like we have a category if we define
there to be an arrow a --> b whenever a --o b is large.  Unfortunately,
despite the internal composition above, there is no external
composition.  In fact, call a small if a* is large.  The same reason
there is a map T --> a when a is large forces there to be a map a --> I
(the empty set) when a is small.  But the principal ultrafilter at any x
in X is both large and small (it is self-dual), so there is both T --> a
and a --> I. Needless T --o I is not large (it is I).  So that is it.
There is a graph, not closed under composition, but there is an internal
composition.  I suppose I should check if there is an arrow
 ((a --o b) /\ (b --o c) /\ (c --o d)) --> (a --o d)
 and so on but I'll bet there is.  (The binary composition involves 64
cases and I wrote a simple computer program to check them.  This one
would requre 256 and while there is no problem extending it to that
number, there needs to be a new idea to do it for an arbitrary number of
factors.

Of course, one way of making a category is to make all objects
isomorphic, with internal structure that separates them.  This seems
perverse, since the whole idea of categories is that isomorphic objects
should not be distinguishable.

Hi,
Recently I presented in the Hewlett Packard conference  HiPer'99  the
paper
    "Translating Mathematica expressions to High Performance Fortran"
with the following abstract:

This paper introduces some ideas for translating the functional language
Mathematica to the data-parallel language High Performance Fortran
(HPF). It first discusses why we have the ability to do that. Then it
gives some interpretations by Category Theory. Third the translating
approach is presented for different Mathematica expressions that could
be interpreted as specifications for parallel independence, reduction,
task parallelism and
subprogram's data mapping. Last is shown a simple executable program
generated by the translator.

You can find more about that on
http://www.imm.dtu.dk./~aaa/MathematicaToHPF.html   .

I am glad that Category theory exists! With it I was able to express
that Functional, Object-oriented and Parallel programing are the same
kind of management.

Regards
Anton

Bonjour,

I have calculations to do in a cubical omega-category 
(see works of Brown, Higgins, etc... for the definition). 
I have to verify some equalities.
I am wondering whether there is a program (Maple, anything else)
in order to simplify automatically expressions containing 
only the usual operators like the three families of degeneracy 
maps of a cubical set with connections, operations +_j, and the 
usual face maps. 

Every composition of degeneracy maps and face maps can be
ordered with the degeneracy maps of the cubical sets in the
first place (in a canonical order), followed by the connection
maps, followed by the face maps. But I do not see a canonical
way to deal with +_j (because of the interchange law for example).

The 1999 Annual Conference of the European Association for Computer
Science Logic follows previous CSL Conferences:
   CSL'98 (Brno, Czech Republic), CSL'97 (Aarhus, Denmark),
   CSL'96 (Utrecht, The Netherlands), CSL'95 (Paderborn, Germany),
   CSL'94 (Kazimierz, Poland), CSL'93 (Swansea, United Kingdom),
   CSL'92(San Miniato, Italy), CSL'91 (Berne, Switzerland),
   CSL'90 (Heidelberg, Germany), CSL'89 (Kaiserslautern, Germany),
   CSL'88 (Duisburg, Germany), and CSL'87 (Karlsruhe, Germany).
CSL'99 will be held in Madrid (Spain). The event is
organized jointly by the Computer Science Departments
(DSIP and DACYA) of Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

The scientific program includes 34 selected papers from among 91
submissions, five invited lectures, and two tutorials on theorem
proving and rewriting techniques, scheduled on September 24
afternoon (Friday) and September 25 morning (Saturday), immediately
after the main conference.

In addition to the scientific program, the social program includes
an excursion to Segovia (a nearby historic city), and a conference
dinner. Madrid offers the opportunity to enjoy both Spain and one of
the most attractive capitals in Europe.

In this document you can find the Invited Lecturers, Tutorials,
Scientific Programme, General Information, Registration and
Accommodation Information. The CSL'99 Web page
http://mozart.sip.ucm.es:1580/csl99/

This is a very sophisticated problem, involving rewrite theory. 

Without the compositions, and with only one connection, there is work in 
86. (with A.P.TONKS), ``Calculations with simplicial and cubical groups 
in AXIOM'', {\em J. Symbolic Computation}, 17 (1994) 159-179. 

But AXIOM is not the easiest to get working for you! I have not looked at 
this for a long time. 

The difficulties of using the interchange rule are quickly seen by 
considering pre crossed and crossed modules. We actually did some 
calculations of induced crossed modules in 

92. (with C.D.WENSLEY), ``On finite induced crossed modules and the 
homotopy 2-type of mapping cones'', {\em Theory
and Applications of Categories} 1(3) (1995) 54-71. 
95. (with C.D.WENSLEY), ``Computing crossed modules induced by an 
inclusion of a normal subgroup, with applications to
homotopy 2-types'', {\em Theory and Applications of Categories} 2 (1996) 
3-16. 

There is more on rewriting in Heyworth-Wensley

I thoroughly appreciate the need!

Subject: categories: Mac Lane's inclusions
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca

This note gives an alternative characterization of "inclusions" in Mac
Lane's sense; and proves every category with selected monics is equivalent
to one with "inclusions". Some of it may have been known before and if so I
would appreciate references.

	In a circular letter Saunders Mac Lane has suggested paying attention to
"inclusions" in categorical set theory.  The main questions about this have
general categorical answers as follows. A category has "selected monics" if
for each object C, each equivalence class of monics to C has one selected
representative. The selected monics are called "inclusions" if whenever
C'>->C and C">->C' are selected, the composite C">->C is also selected.

	The following alternative characterization motivates the construction in
the next theorem but is not actually used to prove it. Given monics i and j
to a single object, with i<j, the monic h such that jh=i will be called the
"transition monic" from i to j. (For e-mail convenience I write i<j to mean
i is included in or equal to j.) 

Fact: In any category with selected monics, the selected monics are
inclusions if and only if: for all selected monics i and j with i<j, the
transition monic h is also selected.

Proof: First suppose i:I>->C and j:J>->C are selected, and selected monics
compose. The transition h must have some selected equivalent k:K>->J, and so
jk is selected and equivalent to i, which implies jk=i and k=h so h is
selected. Conversely suppose h:I>->J and j:J>->C are selected and transition
monics between selected monics are selected. Then jh:I>->C has some selected
equivalent m and for some iso g we have jhg=m. Thus hg is transition monic
between the selected m and j, and so hg is selected. But hg is also
equivalent to the selected h so hg=h and g is an identity. Thus jh=m is
selected. 

 
	In any topos with selected pullbacks we have selected monics, since for any
equivalence class of monics we can take the selected pullback of "true"
along the characteristic arrow. These need not be inclusions. However, we
have:  

Theorem: Any category A with selected monics is equivalent to a category AI
with inclusions.
Proof: 	Let the objects of AI be the selected monics C>->B of A.  An AI
arrow from C'>->B' to C>->B is simply an A arrow C'-->C. That is, AI arrows
ignore the monics and just look at the domains. Obviously AI is equivalent
to A and an arrow is monic in AI iff it is monic in A. As the selected
monics to an AI  object C>->B we take those AI monics h

                               h:C'>-------->C
                                 v           v
                                 |           |
                                 |           |
                                 v           v
                                 B    =      B

which lie over the same B and make the triangle commute in A. Clearly these
compose, and each monic to C>->B in AI is equivalent to exactly one of these.

        In particular, given any axiomatic theory of a topos with selected
pullbacks: if the axioms are preserved by equivalence, then we can
consistently add the assumption of inclusions. We can assume selected monics
compose. Of course it remains to actually use this assumption to secure the
advantages that Saunders sees for it.

This is actually a "dual" question.
Basically I want to do the dual of the construction
gives the notion of an exponential or map object.

Suppose we have a category C with sums. Then we build the
following category from C.

object:  T+X<-----Y

map: from T+X<-----Y  to T+X'<-------Y is a C map "alpha"  such
that we have the following diagram:

                   I-sub-T+alpha
         T+X---------------------------->T+X'
           ^                              ^
            \                            /
             \                          /
              \                        /
               \                      /
                \                    /
                 \                  /
                  \                /
                   \              /
                    \            /
                     \          /
                      \        /
                       \      /
                        \    /
                         \  /
                          \/
                          Y


   Then suppose there exists a C-object called Y**T such
that  T+Y**T<-------Y is the initial object of the category
just built above. What significance does Y**T have opposed
to the concept of an exponential???? If I did everything
correctly it (Y**T) should be the dual of T**Y.

Bill Halchin

Colin,

Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that every \tau-category is a 
category with inclusions.  Moreover, I recall a result by Freyd that every 
(sufficiently small? cartesian?) category is equivalent to a \tau-category. 
 The proof does not use choice.

In any event, see Categories, Allegories by Freyd and Scedrov for 
\tau-categories.  Hope this helps.

Dear category people,

Given an object M in the ``normal'' category of finitely dimensional
smooth manifolds Man (not in SDG sense), what it the universal property
of the tangent bundle TM?

So far, I found only the following:

For every manifold M there is a functor F:I -> Man0, where Man0 is
category of open areas in R^n and smooth mapping, such that M=Colim F,
F corresponding to the atlas on M and M is represented as a result of
gluing instances of R^n in the atlas. This functor can be trivially
modified (by multiplying its values on objects on R^n and modifying
morphisms appropriately) to get functor TF:I -> Man0, such that
TM=Colim TF.

But this doesn't seem satisfactory because:

1. Construction of TF follows one particular construction of TM as a
set of triples (x,(U,f),h) where x \in U, (U,f) is in atlas and h \in
R^n with appropriate points identified.

2. I hope there should be universal construction with \pi: TM -> M as
universal arrow.

3. As tangent bundle is so ubiquitous there should be nice universal
property for it.

With regards,
N. Danilov.

        There is certainly a similarity. Tau categories are cartesian
categories (categories with all finite limits) which not only have selected
monics but also selected jointly-monic n-tuples for all finite n; and all
these things compose. Freyd shows every cartesian category is equivalent to
a tau category.

        My construction seems very like Peter's but shortened by working
only on monics and not jointly monic lists, and never using limits.

Forgive my ignorance: is T+Y**T<----Y to be initial because
the usual construction for the exponential has the relevant
arrow as terminal? Can you suggest to me a reference for that
construction of exponentials?

As for significance: my own research into co-exponentials is
in terms of them as characteristic of lattices dual to
Heyting algebras. These dual-Heyting algebras work well
as algebras for a brand of paraconsistent logic (they have
a complement operator which has in general that an element
and its complement overlap). Alternatively, you can
think of co-exponentials as productive of the interesting
topological notions associated with closed sets, like boundary.

My feeling is that co-exponentials count as useful in more
interesting kinds of maths than turn up simply in those
categories dual to toposes.

Dear catetory theorist,


I am looking for a precise reference about the construction
of the free cubical omega category (with connnections I mean)
generated by a cubical set (I am not interested in the proof : 
I have already a proof). I just need a bibliographical 
reference. If possible in a paper easily available, not a 
preprint difficult to find :-).

Thank you in advance. pg.

I don't know if this is relevant to your question, but there is an example in
programming semantics where the dual of a cartesian closed
category has independent significance, due to Lafont, Streicher, Reus
and Hofmann.  (Some further work was done by Selinger.)  It is found in the following paper:
		  
@Article{StreicherReus:continuations,
  title =        "Classical logic, continutation semantics and abstract
                 machines",
  author =       "Th. Streicher and B. Reus",
  pages =        "543--572",
  journal =      "Journal of Functional Programming",
  month =        nov,
  year =         "1998",
  volume =       "8",
  number =       "6",
}

The construction is as follows.

Let C be a distributive
category, and let Ans (the "answer type") be an object in C, such that the exponential X -> Ans exists for
each object X.  Define two categories K and
N as follows. Both have the same objects as C.  In K, a morphism from
X to Y is a C-morphism from X x (Y -> Ans) to Ans.  In N, a morphism
from X to Y is a C-morphism from (X -> Ans) x Y to Ans. 

 Clearly these two
categories are dual.  Streicher and Reus' paper makes it clear that just as K can be
used to interpret a typed call-by-value language with control effects (which
was well-known), N can be used to interpret a typed call-by-name language
with control effects.  Like any call-by-name model, N is cartesian closed:

the product of X and Y in N is given by X+Y

the exponential from X to Y in N is given by (X -> Ans) x Y

K is certainly an important category, but I wouldn't say that the fact
that it has coexponentials is significant.

Several authors have been interested in this problem many years ago, that
has led to the study of the functors from Man to the category of vector
bundles. Such functors are completely characterized in

        Epstein, "Natural vector bundles", Lecture Notes in Math. 99,
Springer 1969,         p. 171-195.

>From his theorems, it results in particular that Ehresmann's first order
velocity functors Tn which associate to a manifold M the vector bundle of
the 1-jets from R^n to M (in particular T for n=1) are the only such product
preserving functors.

This result is generalized in an abstract setting to characterize
connections in:
        Bowshell, "Abstract velocity functors", Cahiers de Topologie et
Geom. Diff.         XII-1 (1971), 57-82.

Later on, related (or more general) problems are considered in:

        Palais & Terng, "Natural bundles have finte order", Topology 16
(1977),       271-277,
        Epstein & Thurston, "Transformation groups and natural bundles",
Proc.  London Math. Soc. 38 (1979), 219-236.

App. Algebra 42 (1986), 133-140.

THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LOGIC (IFCoLog)

A MANIFESTO

Computational Logic has outgrown its humble beginnings and early
expectations by far: with close to ten thousand people working in
research and development of logic-related methods, with several dozen
international conferences and workshops addressing the growing
richness and diversity of the field, and with the foundational role
and importance these methods now assume in mathematics, computer
science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics and
many engineering fields -- where logic-related techniques are used
inter alia to state and settle correctness issues -- the field has
diversified in ways that the pure logicians working in the early 
decades of this century could have hardly anticipated.

Dating back to its roots in Greek philosophy as presented in the works
of Aristotle, logic has grown in richness and diversity over the
centuries to finally find today's methodological approach in the
work of Frege.  These logical calculi, which capture an important aspect of
human thought, were now amenable to investigations with mathematical
rigor and the beginning of this century saw the influence of these
developments in the foundation of mathematics with the work of
Hilbert, Russell and Whitehead, in the foundation of syntax and
semantics of language, and in philosophical foundations expressed most
explicitly by the logicians in the Vienna Circle.

Picking up on these developments and on the early dreams of mechanized
reasoning the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 advocated explicitly the
hopes for the new possibilities that the advent of electronic
computing machinery offered: logical statements could now be executed
on a machine with all its far-reaching consequences that ultimately
led to logic programming, deduction systems for mathematics and
engineering, logical design and verification of computer software and
hardware, deductive databases and software synthesis as well as
logical techniques for the analysis of mechanical machinery.  In this
way the growing richness of foundational and purely logical
investigations that had led to such developments as:

  - first order calculi
  - type theory and higher order logic
  - non-classical logics
  - semantics
  - constructivism and others
  
were enriched by new questions and problems to be asked in particular in
computer science and artificial intelligence, leading to:

  - denotational semantics for programming languages
  - nonmonotonic reasoning
  - logical foundations for computing machinery such as CSP, ?-Calculs
       and others for program verification
  - logical foundations for cognitive robotics (the frameproblem)
  - syntax and semantics for natural language processing
  - logical foundations for data bases
  - linear logics
  - logical foundations and the philosophy of mind and many others.

This growing diversity is reflected in the numerous conferences and
workshops that address particular aspects of the fields mentioned.  

For example, only twenty years ago, there was just one international
conference on automated deduction (later to be called CADE).  Today
there is not only CADE but also: 

  - RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications)
  - LPAR (Logic Programming and Automated Reasoning)
  - the TABLEAUX Conference
  - UNIF (Unification Workshop)
  - FTP (First Order Theorem Proving), and
  - LICS (Logic in Computer Science), 

each of which is held regularly with its own set of proceedings and
supported by a mature community.  Frequently these conferences are
backed up by dozens of national and international workshops, such as
JELIA, CALCULEMUS, the Induction Workshops, PROOF.PRESENTATION,
USERINTERFACES for ATP; the Nonmonotonic Reasoning Workshops, the
Knowledge Representation Conference(s), the Frame Problem meetings and
many more.  

A similar growth of meetings has been seen in the other areas
mentioned before, namely logic programming with its main conferences
and workshops (more than two dozen regular meetings and events) which
are now somehow unified into CL 2000.  Similar growth and
diversity can be seen in linguistics and natural language processing
with its conferences and workshops (again about a dozen conferences
and workshops) as well as logic and the philosophy of science with its
world conference: Congress for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of
Science.  Logical foundations of computer science and verification has
seen a major growth with its traditional conference LICS, but nowadays
represented also by CAV (Computer Aided Verification), FM-Europe
(Formal Methods) and others, each of which accompanied again by a few
dozen national and international workshops and many events that
reflect the growing industrial importance of these techniques.

This diversity is not necessarily disadvantageous, as every community
that has evolved addresses its own important set of problems and
issues, and it is clear that one group cannot address them all.
However, fragmentation can carry a heavy price intellectually -- as
well as politically -- in the wider arena of scientific activity
where, unfortunately, logical investigations are still often perceived
as limited.

For these and other reasons we hereby propose the establishment of an
international federation -- IFCoLog -- to be registered as a legal
entity and possibly accepted as a member society in the International
Union of Sciences (IUS).  The members of the International Federation
for Computational Logic (IFCoLog) will be the communities attached to
the major conferences and logic societies, and they in turn will
encompass the individual members working on logic related topics.

THE FEDERATION

How can these dozens of societies, sociologically grown communities
and conference affiliates be re-united without losing their historical
identities? One possible solution is inspired by the manner in which
the European AI societies are organised into ECCAI (European
Co-ordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence): there is one
registered society, namely ECCAI, whose members are the European
national AI-Societies.  With the growing unification of Europe there
are currently about 25 members who represent all AI researchers and
whose representatives meet every two years at the time of ECAI, the
European Conference of Artificial Intelligence.

So the idea for IFCoLog is as follows: An International Federation for
Computational Logic (IFCoLog) will be created and legally registered,
whose members are the current (and future) communities related to
computational logic.  Currently, this would include the groups and
their respective representatives who are listed below for the Board of
IFCoLog.  Some of these are actually organised into legal societies,
others are just centred around a conference or not legally organised
at all, but still form a scientific community of considerable size and
importance.  To make this workable, it will be required to form an
organisational structure that does not infringe on the interests of
the individual communities but nevertheless ensures maximum cohesion.
The following organization is therefore proposed:

THE BOARD

The Board should be composed of one representative from each member
society or community.  This may be a delegate elected by the society
or simply the current chairperson.  Initial members would be the dozen
or so groups listed below.  Subsequently newcomers will be able to
apply formally and be admitted on the basis of a majority vote of the
Board.  The idea is that this should be an open process with as little
factionalism as possible: the main motivation is not to alienate, but
to unite.

THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL

This is the actual executive that would run the business of the
Federation, and it should be comprised of:

  - The President
  - Five Vice-presidents
  - A Chief Executive Officer
  - The Treasurer
  - The PR Officer (for journals, WWW, press releases, etc),
and possibly
  - A full-time co-ordinator and a halftime secretary.

1. The President.  This should be an outstanding scientist with
appropriate presidential personality who can unite and bring together
the many factions.  He or she is not necessarily active in the
day-to-day running of the Federation.  The President will be elected
by the Board and the Executive Council.

2. The Vice-Presidents.  There should be five vice-presidents elected
by the Board and the Executive Council for a limited period of time
(say 3 years).  Ideally the five VPs should represent the major
scientific subareas, such as symbolic logic, logic programming,
automated deduction, logic in computer science and artificial
intelligence, formal methods and verification, logic and language as
well as logic and philosophy.  Three of the vice presidents should
come from the three major geographical regions of the world: North
America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.  This reflects the current shape
of the global village, which is likely to remain dominant for the
first part of the next century at least.  The fourth Vice-President
should come from the Network of Excellence in Computational Logic
(Compulog Net) which would provide some initial funds and resources
and the fifth vice president should represent any of the other
subfields.

THE JOINT CONFERENCE

Every four years, the member communities agree to hold one major
conference -- IJCoLog: The International Joint Conference of the
Federation for Computational Logic -- that consists of the
back-to-back conferences of the individual members, similar to FLoCS
which is held every two years, while the individual conferences like
CADE, LICS; CL 2000 etc.  will be held yearly or biannually.  This
united conference, with probably more than a thousand expected
participants, will be a major show of strength, unification and
cross-fertilisation, and will ensure the overall visibility of the
Federation.

OTHER TASKS

Inasmuch as the Federation aims to counterbalance the growing division
in the field and to represent it once again in its entirety, it is
deemed to work in order to:
  - influence funding policy
  - increase international visibility
  - set up concrete educational curricula
  - set up special chairs
  - encourage high-quality teaching materials (books, videos, etc)
  - maintain an active information policy similar to COMPULOG-Net 
  - create an infrastructure for web sites and links
  - maintain a register of individual and corporate e-mail addresses
  - establish an informal journal, (such as AI Magazine,
       "Computational Logic" or others)
  - found a formal scientific journal (possibly electronic).
  - foster an association with the databases of DBLP, COMPULOG etc.

Indeed, co-exponentials are closely tied the semantics of call/cc-like
control operators. This connection is perhaps expressed more directly in
the following (regrettably somewhat unpolished) work:

@MastersThesis{Filinski:89a,
  author =      "Andrzej Filinski",

  URL =         "http://www.brics.dk/~andrzej/papers/DCaCD.ps.gz"
}

@InProceedings{Filinski:89b,
  author =      "Andrzej Filinski",
  title =       "Declarative Continuations: An Investigation of
                 Duality in Programming Language Semantics",
  booktitle =   "Category Theory and Computer Science",
  series =      LNCS,
  number =      389,
  address =     "Manchester, UK",
  month =       Sep,
  pages =       "224-249"
}

Specifically, in the category induced by the types and terms of a
call-by-value language with first-class continuations, the coproduct
functor - + A actually has a left adjoint - x (A -> 0), where 0 is the
empty type.  The operational intuition behind this construction is that
a function f : X -> Y + A returning either a "normal" (Y) or an
"exceptional" (A) result corresponds to a function f' : X x (A -> 0) ->
Y, returning only the normal result, but passing any exceptional results
to an additional, non-returning-function parameter.

(In a purely functional language, the type A -> 0 would of course
contain at most one value; but in the presence of control effects, such
as exceptions, there can be many distinct "functions" of this type. And
with a sufficiently powerful control operator, it actually becomes
possible to define co-application and co-currying with equational
properties exactly mirroring those of CCC exponentials.)

Still, as Paul notes,

> K is certainly an important category, but I wouldn't say that the fact
> that it has coexponentials is significant.  

constructing a categorical semantics of a language with control operators
_directly_ in terms of coexponentials is somewhat awkward, and the
formulation used by Streicher and Reus is almost certainly nicer to work
with in practice.

without properly defining what I meant by a cartesian monad. What I

natural transformations, ie the associated naturality squares are
pullbacks.

Soory for the confusion

The _direct_ categorical semantics of languages with control operators
is actually not too unnatural and leads to some interesting category
theory. Let me first clarify the difference between direct and
indirect semantics. To give a direct semantics, one starts with a
class of categories with algebraic structure (for our purposes:
structure that is given by object constructors, morphism constructors,
and equations on morphisms). In the direct interpretation of a
language, types are interpreted as objects, type constructors as
object constructors, and typing judgments as morphisms, in such a way
that the language forms an _internal language_ for the class of
categories at hand. This means, among other things, that one can
construct a syntactic category from a theory of the language. Thus,
all structure of the category (on objects and morhpisms) is denotable
in the language. The usual interpretation of the simply-typed lambda
calculus in a cartesian-closed category is perhaps the best-known
example of a direct semantics. (Direct semantics of higher order can
be given in fibered categories, but this is not necessary for our
purposes here).

In an indirect semantics, one does not interpret the language directly
in a category with algebraic structure, but in a derived auxiliary
category. Moggi's monadic semantics is an example of an indirect
semantics.  Given a category C with a monad T, one interprets the
language (for instance, a call-by-value lambda calculus) in the
Kleisli category of the monad. Notice that the structure of the
Kleisli category, per se, is not necessarily algebraic in the above
sense. The Reus-Streicher-Lafont-Hofmann semantics is indirect; in
fact it is the monadic semantics for the continuations monad
R^(R^(-)).

Indirect semantics are very successful in practise. Among other
things, they have proven excellent tools for reasoning about and
implementing control effects. This point is made convincingly in
Andrzej Filinski's PhD thesis [1]. However, the correspondence between
syntax and semantics is not as close as in the direct case: one cannot
usually speak of internal languages in the context of indirect
semantics.  The reason is that, from a syntactic theory of the
language, one can reconstruct only the Kleisli category of T, but not
the underlying category C or the monad T itself. Thus, direct
semantics might be more satisfying to the theorist, because they
capture the essence of the language precisely, and without resorting
to a translation to a meta-language.

The difference between direct and indirect semantics is explained very
nicely in a recent paper by Carsten Fuhrmann [2], where he also gives
a general method of constructing direct semantics from indirect ones.
It seems that direct semantics are often characterized by the presence
of certain _non-natural_ transformations, and that indirect semantics
are a way of hiding this non-naturality.

The first direct semantics for a call-by-value language with control
effects are the tensor-not categories of Hayo Thielecke [3]. His work
was later extended by me to a language with finite coproducts (this is
where co-exponentials enter the picture) and to the call-by-name case
[4]. I called the resulting class of categories "control
categories". The connection between the direct and indirect semantics
can be established via categorical representation theorems, and such
theorems were shown by Fuhrmann for tensor-not categories [5], and
independently by myself for control categories [4].

It is interesting that a call-by-name language is an internal language
for control categories, and the corresponding call-by-value language
is an internal language for the dual co-control categories. As a
consequence, one obtains a syntactic duality between call-by-name and
call-by-value [4]. Such a duality was conjectured by Streicher and
Reus [6], and certainly anticipated by Filinski's work on the
symmetric lambda calculus [7].

               Workshop on Generic Programming

     http://www.cs.uu.nl/~johanj/wgp2000/wgp2000cfp.html

                         6th July 2000

                   Ponte de Lima, Portugal
                                            

                        Call for papers

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making them
more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds of
polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic programs are often quite rich in structure. For
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, kinds, or
even programming paradigms. 

This workshop follows on the 5th Mathematics of Program Construction
conference. 

This is the second workshop on generic programming, the first workshop on
generic programming (proceedings) was held on Marstrand, Sweden, in 1998. 

                         Submission

Papers (preferably short, no more than 15 pages) should be submitted in
Postscript format by e-mail to reach Johan Jeuring by March 20, 2000.
Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the workshop, which
will appear as a technical report at Utrecht University. 

Submission deadline:  20 March 
Notification:                30 April 
Final version due:        20 May
Workshop:                   6 July

                            Topics

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and theoreticians, but have rarely been a specific focus of
research, until recently. In the last couple of years we have seen: 

    * several language extensions for generic programming
(PolyP,DrIFT,FML,AOOP,FiSH); 
    * lots of examples of generic programming (generalized tries,
unification, data compression, XML applications) ; 
    * programming calculi for generic programming. 

We solicit papers on these topics. The list of topics is not exclusive:
papers on other topics related to generic programming are also welcome.

Dear Category Theorists,

I am pleased to announce the availability of a new paper,

	Categorical Structure of Asynchrony,

available via http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~selinger/papers.html.

In this paper, I investigate properties of traced monoidal categories
that are satisfied by networks of asynchronously communicating
processes. Among these properties are Hasegawa's uniformity principle,
as well as a version of Kahn's principle: the subcategory of
*deterministic* processes is equivalent to a category of domains.

The paper also contains the following observation, which may be of
interest to categorists. I do not know whether this was observed
before, and would be grateful for references. Suppose T:Set-->Set is a
functor which is lax for the symmetric monoidal structure given by
products on the category of sets. Then T associates to any category C
another category C', which Benabou called the "direct image of C by
T". This category is defined as follows:

 obj(C') = obj(C),   and  C'(X,Y) = T(C(X,Y)).

The observation is that direct images preserve linear structure. More
precisely, if the category C possesses some algebraic structure which
is given by linear equations, then C' inherits that structure.
Non-linear structure is not in general preserved, although one can
give conditions on T under which the construction will preserve, for
instance, affine structure. One can also loosen the conditions on T,
so that it will only preserve non-commutative linear structure.

One can use the direct image construction to extract the linear "part"
of an arbitrary algebraic structure: for instance, if C has finite
products, then C' has a monoidal structure with diagonals, which is
precisely the part of a finite product structure which is given by
linear equations.

Traced monoidal structure with diagonals is the linear part of finite
product structure with fixpoints. One direction of this, namely that
the latter structure is a special case of the former, was observed by
Hasegawa and by Hyland, but I don't know whether it had been noticed
that the former is precisely the linear part of the latter.

An example of a non-commutative linear structure (given by linear
equations where the variables occur in the same left-to-right order on
both sides) is the premonoidal structure of Power and Robinson. This
is precisely the non-commutative part of monoidal structure. 

More details and examples are in the paper. Comments are, as usual,
welcome. Best wishes, -- Peter Selinger

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACT:

We investigate a categorical framework for the semantics of
asynchronous communication in networks of parallel processes.
Abstracting from a category of asynchronous labeled transition
systems, we formulate the notion of a categorical model of asynchrony
as a uniformly traced monoidal category with diagonals, such that
every morphism is total and the focus is equivalent to a category of
complete partial orders. We present a simple, non-deterministic,
cpo-based model that satisfies these requirements, and we discuss how
to refine this model by an observational congruence. We also present a
general construction of passing from deterministic to
non-deterministic models, and more generally, from non-linear to
linear structure on a category.
