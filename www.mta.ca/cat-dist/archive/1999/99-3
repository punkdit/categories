researchers interested in incorporating object-oriented concepts 
and  formal methods for specification of distributed systems and
behaviours. 

TOPICS (NOT EXCLUSIVE LIST):
============================
Object-oriented approaches to specification of distributed systems 
and behaviours.

Semantic models for concurrency and object-orientation (e.g. based on the 
lambda-calculus, process algebra, pi-calculus, linear logic).

Characteristic examples of object-oriented specification from real 
application domains (e.g. distributed algorithms, workflow specification, 
communication protocols).

Logic reasoning on distributed systems and behaviours.

SUBMISSION:
===========
The deadline for submission is September 14, 1999. 
Submission is in electronic form only.
Submission may be of two forms:
	Extended abstracts: up to 3 pages.
	Papers and reports: up to 6 pages.
In both cases a separate page with the following information: title, author(s), 
corresponding author, contact information and a 12-15 lines summary 
should be included.
The papers and/or abstracts should be sent by e-mail to 
ustin@informatik.uni-rostock.de.

PUBLICATION:
============
Selected submissions will be published in a refereed journal after the workshop.
The others will be published electronically.

             Department of Mathematics & Computer Science

        3 PH.D. STUDENTSHIPS IN MATHEMATICS OR COMPUTER SCIENCE


Applications are invited for three fully funded research studentships
leading to the degree of Ph.D. in any aspect of Mathematics or
Computer Science. The studentships are available for studies beginning
in October 1999 to persons who are normally resident in the E.U.
Applicants should have, or expect to obtain, a first or upper second
class degree in a relevant subject area.

The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is divided into
three groups: Pure Mathematics, Applicable Mathematics and Computer
Science.  The Pure Mathematics Group carries out research in various
aspects of algebra, algebraic topology and symbolic dynamics. The key
areas of expertise are in the representation theory of finite
dimensional algebras, of finite groups and of quantum groups and in
algebraic topology and its applications to dynamical systems, algebra
and analysis.  The Applicable Mathematics Group focuses mainly on
numerical analysis, and in particular on: approximation theory; the
numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations; and
integral equations.  Research in the Computer Science Group has three
main themes: logic, algebra and complexity; the theory of distributed
systems; and semantics. There is an active Graduate Programme.

Candidates should identify their preferred area of research and
supervisor. Details of the possible areas of research and supervisors
are available via the Departmental web pages (http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk)
or the Department's Postgraduate Brochure. The Postgraduate Brochure,
application forms and further details are available from
Dr. S. J. Ambler, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science,
Leicester University, Leicester LE1 7RH (telephone: 0116 252 3406,
email: S.Ambler@mcs.le.ac.uk). The closing date for applications is
1st May 1999.

Dear category theorists, 

Recently I came across geometric formulae (built up from atomic formulae
using only conjunction, disjunction and existential quantification).  I
would know like to know whether there is any way to decide whether an
arbitrary given first order formula is (classically) equivalent to a
geometric formula (or geometric axiom: phi -> psi where phi and psi are
both geometric formulae).  I've looked in the book by Mac Lane and Moerdijk
but didn't discover a general decision method.  Any hints or references
to relevant literature would be much appreciated.

Best regards,
Karel Stokkermans

	Yes, this question is disussed in Kieslers' paper on "Generalized Atomic
Formulas" from the early 1960s. The third name , which I prefer, for the
class is simply "positive" formulas. They are of course a key tool in the
Presentations of a Positive Theory. 
	This may not agree exactly with some
previous uses of the term "positive", since the not-so-innocuous use of
universal prefixes has been eliminated along with the excessive
burden that had been put on the single element "TRUE"; the presentation
machinery for positive theories must involve a BINARY relation of
entailment (for each admitted arity of formula) in place of the single
0-ary relation of provability. This is actually a simplication rather than
a complication although that may not have been clear in the 1930s As far as
 expressive power is concerned, one can say that for Boolean models (as
opposed to models in more general toposes) positive theories are as
general as what have been called "standard presentation first order
theories" : Any particular negation occurring in a presentation of one of
the latter can be replaced by a new primitive relation symbol, nailed to
what it is to negate by the usual pair of lattice (hence positive) new
axioms.
	The geometric role of positive theories is that via
 the classifying-topos construction they provide a standard way
to geometrically visualize models of arbitrary theories via the
 algebraic-geometry paridigm (ie via the body of mathematics created by
Kan, Isbell, Grothendieck, and Yoneda in the decade 1954-1964). Of course,
one of the theories which most interested the model theory pioneers
Birkhoff, Robinson, and Tarski was the theory of commutative rings, so
this extension may seem as natural to us as it did to them.
	Kiesler's paper shows us that the explicit relation between
positivity and preservation under morphisms was recognized clearly quite
a long time ago. Are there papers which also draw the conclusion that the 
"standard" theories and presentations should really be the positive ones,
with negation as a cared-for particular rather than a blanket general ? 
	Whether the possibility of recursive presentability of a given
mathematical concept might vary under this change is not clear to me.(Of
course "quantifier elimination" in some cases changes to an exceptional
"quantifier definability"). Also, the original question concerning whether
(for example) the inclusion, of a positive theory into the associated
theory in the doctrine which has negation and universal quantifiers, is
itself recursive qua inclusion, probably has a negative answer, but I
don't have a reference.

For myself, the short answer is I don't know.

Perhaps I ought to, since I've made lots of geometric theries out of
classical ones, but in practice the problem goes further than a strict
answer to the question would provide. One often needs not just to transform
the theories within a fixed language but to tranform the language itself. A
simple example is negation as "cared-for particular" to use Bill's phrase.
It is especially true once one starts using the full geometric logic, with
infinitary disjunctions (unlike the coherent logic in Mac Lane and
Moerdijk). One then sees, for instance, that geometric logic is actually
weak second order, with universal quantification bounded over finite sets.

	Karel Stokkermans asked about a decision procedure for checking
whether an arbitrary given first-order formula is classically equivalent
to a geometric one.  There is no such algorithm.  The reason is that any
such algorithm could easily be converted into an algorithm for testing
(classical, first-order) validity, which is well-known to be undecidable. 
To test a formula A for validity, take a 0-ary predicate symbol P that
doesn't occur in A, and let A' be the formula "A or not P".  Then A' is
equivalent to a geometric formula (namely "true") if and only if A is
valid.  So just test A' for geometricity and you'll know whether A is
valid.  (If, like some textbook authors, you don't believe in 0-ary
predicate symbols, use P(x) instead, where P is unary.) 
	Bill Lawvere asked whether there are "papers which also draw the
conclusion that the 'standard' theories and presentations should really be
positive ones, with negation as a cared-for particular rather than a
blanket general".  I assume he means papers where this is done for a
purpose other than having geometric theories or the nice things that come
with them, like classifying topoi.  In a paper that Yuri Gurevich and I
wrote long ago ["Existential fixed-point logic" in "Computation Theory and
Logic", edited by Egon Boerger, Springer Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 270
(1987) pp.20-36], we found it convenient to adopt the following
convention, which though not quite what Bill described, is similar in
spirit: A first-order language (or signature or similarity-type) should
have its predicate symbols classified into two sorts, positive and
negatable.  Negation can be applied only to atomic formulas whose
predicate symbol is negatable.  Homomorphisms are required to preserve the
interpretations of all predicate symbols and to reflect the
interpretations of the negatable ones.

       Title: Quantum vertex algebras
       Authors: Richard E. Borcherds
       Comments: 18 pages, plain tex
       Subj-class: Quantum Algebra; Category Theory 
concludes with a large set of problems
some of which are strictly n-categorical

       The purpose of this paper is to make the theory of vertex algebras
trivial. We do this by
       setting up some categorical machinery so that vertex algebras are
just ``singular
       commutative rings'' in a certain category. This makes it easy to
construct many examples of
       vertex algebras, in particular by using an analogue of the
construction of a twisted group ring
       from a bicharacter of a group. We also define quantum vertex
algebras as singular braided
       rings in the same category and construct some examples of them. The
constructions work
       just as well for higher dimensional analogues of vertex algebras.

     Title: Using Rewriting Systems to Compute Kan Extensions and Induced 
     Actions of Categories
     Authors: Ronald Brown, Anne Heyworth (University Of Wales, Bangor)
     Comments: 31 pages, LaTeX2e, (submitted to JSC)
     Subj-class: Combinatorics
     MSC-class: 68Q42 18A40 68Q40 

The basic method of rewriting for words in a free monoid given a 
monoid presentation is extended to rewriting for paths in a free 
category given a `Kan extension presentation'. This is related to 
work of Carmody-Walters on the Todd-Coxeter procedure for Kan extensions, 
but allows for the output data to be infinite, described by a language. 
The result also allows rewrite methods to be applied in a
greater range of situations and examples, in terms of induced  actions of 
monoids, categories, groups or groupoids. (28kb)

	Verification of Dynamic Linear Lists for All Numbers of Processes

in PostScript format can be obtained through my webpage:

ABSTRACT:

In real-world design and verification of concurrent systems
with many identical processes, the 
number of processes is never a factor in the system correctness.  
This paper embodies such an engineering reasoning to 
propose an almost automatic method to safely verify 
safety properties of such systems.  
The central idea is to construct a finite collective quotient structure
(CQS) which collapses state-space representations for all system
implementations with all numbers of processes.  
The problem is presented as safety bound problem which ask if 
the number of processes satisfying a certain property exceeds a given bound.  
Our method can be applied to systems with dynamic linear lists of unknown
number of processes.  
Processes can be deleted from or inserted at any position of the linear list 
during transitions.  
We have used our method to develop CQS constructing algorithms for 
two classes of concurrent systems : 
(1) untimed systems with a global waiting queue and 
(2) dense-time systems with one local timer per process.  
We show that our method is both sound and complete in verifying the 
first class of systems.  
The verification problem for the second class systems is 
undecidable even with only one global binary variable.
However, our method can still automatically generate a 
CQS of size no more than 1512 nodes to 
verify that an algorithm in the class: Fischer's timed 
algorithm indeed preserves mutual exclusion for any number of processes.

Greetings, fellow categorists.

I'm wondering, if anybody has ever described the following monoidal
structure on the category of oriented multigraphs, what MacLane calls
graphs, the most common kind of graph in category theory (but not
everywhere) :

Given mgs X, Y, the set |X-oY| of vertices on  X-oY  is the set of mg
morphisms
X --> Y.

Given f,g : X --> Y the set of arrows f-->g is the set of pairs
(p_0,p_1) of functions such that

forall  x in |X|, p_0(x) : f-->g

forall  k: x-->y in X, p_1(k) : f(x)-->g(y)

This co-contra bifunctor has a tensor left adjoint, which is symmetric
and monoidal. 

I would be quite surprised if this structure had never been seen before.
Enriched universal algebra in there has applications in computer
science.

Thanks,

Francois Lamarche

Given the private replies I got to yesterday's queries, it is obvious I
was not clear enough, and indeed there was an unhelpful typo.

OK Saunders, from now on they're graphs. This what happens when you hang
out with combinatorists AND category theorists.

>

> X --> Y.

So right from the start this is not the usual presheaf CC structure,
where the set of vertices is the set of all functions |X| --> |Y| .

So in what follows I use categorical notation for vertices, arrows, etc.
 
> Given f,g : X --> Y the set of arrows f-->g is the set of pairs
> (p_0,p_1) of functions such that
> 
> forall  x in |X|, p_0(x) : f(x)-->g(x)
> 
> forall  k: x-->y in X, p_1(k) : f(x)-->g(y)

Now the typo has been corrected. So an arrow f --> g is like a natural
transformation, with p_0 the usual familly of arrows indexed by the
vertices/objects of X, but since things don't compose, you add the
diagonal p_1 as part of the information. There is some kinship to
homotopies, as M. Barr has remarked.

Is this more understandable?

Thanks again

A structure closely related to the one which Francois Lamarche
asked about appeared in my thesis (1992) [see below] as a simple example of
a sesqui-category which is not a 2-category. I too would expect
it's appeared elsewhere, but I don't know where.

John Stell

\subsubsection{An Example of a Sesqui-Category}
We include an example to show that there are naturally occurring
sesqui-categories other than in connection with modelling
term rewriting. The underlying 
category is {\bf Graph}. Suppose there are graphs $G$ and $H$, and
graph morphisms $g,h : G \rightarrow H$. In this situation, the 2-cells
$\alpha : g \rightarrow h$ are assignments to each node $n$ of $G$ of a
path of edges from $ng$ to $nh$ in $H$. 

The compositions $\circ_R$ and 
$\circ_L$ are readily defined. If $f : F \rightarrow G$ then 
$f \circ_R \alpha$ assigns to a node $m$ of $F$ the path $(mf)\alpha$ in $H$.
For the left composition, suppose we have $k : H \rightarrow K$.
Since $n\alpha$ is a path in $H$, we obtain a path $(n\alpha)k$ by applying
$k$ to each of the edges in the path $n \alpha$. Thus we define 
$\alpha \circ_L k$ to be the assignment to $n$ of the path $(n \alpha)k$.

The vertical composition is the usual concatenation of paths. The identity
2-cells are assignments of zero length paths.

I did not quite understand Francois' construction.  However, my first
reaction to a question like that is that it ought to be a homotopy.  So
I will say what a homotopy reduces to in this case and leave it to
Francois to decide if this is what he has.

I suspect that rather few people know what a simplicial homotopy is and,
of those, rather few have ever actually verified one.  I am in that
minority^2, so perhaps I tend to see them where they are not the most
natural, but I think it quite remarkable that they can arise where no
real topology (but some combinatorics) is present.

I have to begin by saying how a graph becomes a simplicial set.
Actually, that is a lie, since unless you are dealing with reflexive
graphs--that are equipped with a selected loop at each vertex--you will
only get a face complex.  But homotopies are still definable.  A
category is a simplicial set by taking for n-simplexes composable
n-tuples of arrows.  This doesn't work for graphs, since the "interior
faces" (all except the lowest and highest numbered) all depend on
composition.  But there is a face complex in which an n-simplex is
simply an n-simplex in the graph.  So a 2-simplex is a
triangle--obviously non-commutative and a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron and
so on.  You can describe a composable n-tuple in a category as
commutative n-simplex, so this isn't so different.  Now given this, if
f,g:  X --> Y are graph morphisms, what is a homotopy?  Well, write X as
d^0,d^1:  X_1 --> X_0 and similarly for Y. Then f consists of f_0:  X_0
--> Y_0 and f_1:  X_1 --> Y_1 giving a serially commutative square.
Just a homomtopy between functors turns out to be simply a natural
transformation, a homotopy in this case turns out to consist of a
function p_0:  X_0 --> Y_1 and a function p_1:  X_1 --> Y_1 such that
there
is a diagram (not, of course commutative; what a diagram does is specify
source and target) as follows.  In this diagram I assume x:  x^0 --> x^1
in X, and f(x):  y^0 --> y^1 and g(x):  z^0 --> z^1 in Y.
                            f(x)
                    y^0 -----------> y^1
                     | \              |
                     |  \             |
                     |   \            |
                     |    \           |
                     |     \          |
                     |      \         |
                     |       \        |
             p_0(x^0)|  p_1(x)\       |p_0(x^1)
                     |         \      |
                     |          \     |
                     |           \    |
                     |            \   |
                     |             \  |
                     |              \ |
                     v      g(x)     vv
                    z^0 -----------> z^1

So if this is what Francois was saying, then the answer is it a homotopy
of face complexes.  Of course, if you replaced X_1 by X_1 + X_0, you
would have a reflexive graph and I assume (I have not checked this) you
would then get a simplicial homotopy.

BTW, homotopies do not generally compose--and the ones described here do
not appear to either.  Categories are special because of their internal
composition.  It makes me wonder if the well-known failure of dinats to
compose could be related to this in some way.

Having seen Francois' clarification, I think this is exactly what he
had.

On Francois Lamarche's question.

If I understand correctly, the tensor product  X tensor Y  has the obvious
objects  (x, y)  and arrows of three types

(a, y): (x, y) -->  (x', y),  for  a: x -> x'  in  X,  y  in  Y,

(x, b): (x, y) -->  (x, y'),  for  x  in  X,  b: y -> y'  in  Y,

(a, b): (x, y) -->  (x', y'),  for  a  and  b  as above.

***

Remark 1.
We are thus simulating "identities" of  X  and  Y  (which are not given).
In other words, we are considering the cartesian product  X'xY'  of the
free reflexive graphs over  X  and  Y,  and taking out its identities.

Would it not be simpler to work with  REFLEXIVE GRAPHS  and their cartesian
closed structure?
In my opinion, reflexive graphs are more natural than graphs:

reflexive graph = 1-truncated simplicial set = 1-truncated cubical set

It is the topos of presheaves over a FULL subcategory of non-empty ordinals
(or cardinals as well), actually the initial segment  1,  2.

Remark 2.
Roughly speaking, a category enriched over reflexive graphs (wrt the cc
structure) is a "2-category without vertical composition". It has cells  a:
f -> g: X -> Y,  with a categorical horizontal composition; it also has
trivial cells  f -> f: X -> Y  ("vertical identities").

All this is clearly related to homotopy and its abstract settings in
"2-dimensional categories" (in some sense).
And indeed topological spaces, with continuous maps and homotopies, form a
rather obvious example.
The horizontal composition of homotopies

   a: f -> g: X -> Y,    b: h -> k: Y -> Z

is     b(a(x, t), t)               t  in  [0, 1],

which is indeed categorical.

Remark 3.
[The sequel is relevant for homotopy; I do not know if it may be relevant
in CS, but I always had the impression that abstract homotopy should be of
use there, eg with respect to deformations of processes, in some sense.]

I do not think that the latter is the "right" 2-dimensional categorical
setting for abstract homotopy (even as a starting point).
The previous horizontal composition of homotopies is rather artificial; it
is what you get from the "double homotopy"

b(a(x, t), t')       (t, t')  in  [0, 1]^2

through the diagonal  t = t'  of the square.
(The "double homotopy" itself is quite natural, as produced by the cubical
enrichment due to the cylinder functor; it is also important in homotopy.)

When the diagonal of the "standard interval" is missing (eg for chain
complexes of abelian groups), there is no canonical horizontal composition
of homotopies (working with the vertical composition, you get two of them;
the middle four interchange does not hold). But there still are canonical
horizontal compositions of "maps with homotopies" and "homotopies with
maps".

This is why I think that the basic 2-dimensional categorical setting for
abstract homotopy should only treat such "reduced horizontal composition":
arrows with cells, cells with arrows, but NOT cells with cells.
Formally, it is again a category enriched over reflexive graphs, BUT wrt
the following monoidal closed structure:

X tensor Y:
 -  the subgraph of  XxY  whose arrows are pairs  (a, b),  where  a  or  b
is an identity;

[X, Y]:
-   vertices: the graph morhisms;
-   arrows: their transformations (without "diagonals").

References:

a) The last enrichment (with further developments) has been used for
abstract homotopy in:

algebra, Cahiers Top. Geom. Diff. Categ. 33 (1992), 135-175.   [sketch]

 - , Homotopical algebra in homotopical categories, Appl. Categ. Structures
2 (1994), 351-406.

b) A notion equivalent to a category enriched in the same sense had already
been studied in:

h-Faserungen, Manuscripta Math. 3 (1970), 237-255.

Various replies to my query during the day (my thanks to Ronnie Brown
and Lutz Schroeder) made me realize that my SMC structure was actually
the lifting of the CC structure on reflexive graphs (those with a choice
of loop) to ordinary non-reflexive graphs. Here is a bit more detail:

We all know these two categories are categories of presheaves. So let G
and R be the categories such that Set^G is graphs and  Set^R is
reflexive graphs. There is an embedding  G --> R, which generates the
usual triple of functors between the presheaf categories. So it seems
this functorial machinery allows to transform the CC structure in Set^R
into an SMC structure in Set^G, preserving the forgetful functor. There
must be general conditions that allow this.

I'm not pursuing this any more right now, because it has to have been
done before, and in a much more general setting.

Now Michael's comment is also (among other things) about the tension
between graphs and reflexive graphs, and naturally there is Lawvere's
"Qualitative distinctions between some toposes of generalized graphs"
that says a lot about that tension.

there may be more in there than we suspect

Elaine Gouvea Pimentel would "like to know if there is any categorical model
for polymorphic lambda-calculus".

Oh dear. I can see that this one is going to haunt me for the rest of
my life, besides provoking some "discussion" here.  I wrote my thesis
on this subject.

Perhaps I will be personally rid of this albatross when my book comes out.
Chapter VIII contains the definitive account of [my] notion of a "category
with a class of display maps" (or, more briefly, display category).  This
is how I deal with dependent types at the algebraic level (superseding
essentially algebraic theories encoded as categories with all finite limits).
In my view, discussion of quantifiers (whether first order or over types)
should be based on this, as is in fact done in Chapter IX.

There are several different things that you might mean by "polymorphic
lambda-calculus", and no doubt Bart Jacobs or Thomas Streicher will
contribute an overview of the "Barendregt cube".  [Robert Seely also
did some work in this area before most of the other people.]

One thing is that types are expressions involving type variables, with
a universal quantifier over types. Girard calls this System F, and there
is an introductory account in "Proofs and Types" - Girard's book that
Yves Lafont and I translated.

Numerous domain theoretic models of System F were found in the later 1980s,
using both "Scott"-like "continuous" domains and "stable" domains which
were introduced by Berry and popularised by Girard.

ALL of the domain theoretic models, so far as I am aware, had THE SAME
interpretation of type-dependency and the quantifier.  I have seen this
interpretation attributed to Girard, but I regarded it as "well known"
when I was writing my thesis - before Girard's models - and my guess is
that it is due to Gordon Plotkin, probably in the "Pisa notes".

This interpretation of the dependency of the type T[x] on x:X, where X
is in the first instance a domain (and in particular a poset, therefore
a category) is most simply described as a functor T:X->Dom^adj
where Dom^adj denotes the category whose objects are domains and whose
morphisms are [left] adjoint pairs of continuous functions. Many authors
took embeddings (monos with continuous right adjoints) instead, but
the restriction is irrelevant.  The functor T must also be continuous
in the sense of taking directed joins to filtered colimits of left adjoints,
which are also the cofiltered limits of the right adjoints.

For the stable case, replace "continuous" by "stable", where a stable
functor preserves pullbacks, and the unit and counit of the adjunctions
have pullbacks for their naturality squares.   This situation is so
over-constrained that some pretty amazing things (that I discovered but
never wrote up) happen.

The universal quantifier is most concisely described as the category of
sections of the fibration (Grothendieck construction) corresponding to
the functor T above.

That was for first order dependency over a particular domain X.  For
dependency over all domains (System F), replace X by Dom^adj.  It doesn't
matter whether this category happens to be one of your (poset) domains,
so long as you only want System F. (At the time of my thesis I considered
this to be cheating, and laboriously constructed a poset-domain that
"covered" Dom^adj in a suitable sense.  Thierry Coquand and his co-authors
did not consider this to be cheating, and thereby beat me to finding
a model of System F.)  If Dom^adj really is a domain then you get a
model of Coquand's Calculus of Constructions.

Such a model of CoC was described by Martin Hyland and Andy Pitts in the
Boulder proceedings in 1987.    If I still had the inclination to work
on such matters, I could give a simpler version of their model (replacing
the lex categories by display categories).  This was on the "to do" list
throughout the writing of my book - I wanted to include this "simplified"
version as a sequence of exercises - but it was always just over the 
horizon of what could be done with the tools available, given that the
necessary domain-theoretic techniques had been debarred from the book
from its conception.

Another model, whose types are named by countable groupoids (or by the
corresponding presheaf toposes of G-sets) is to be found in my paper
"Quantitative Domains, Groupoids and Linear Logic" in the proceedings
of the 1989 Manchester CTCS.  When I was writing this paper I tried to
get Francois Lamarche to read it, but he said he didn't know anything
about / hated permutation representations.  Nobody else, so far as I can
gather, has ever read it, and now I can no longer follow the most 
difficult calculations.  However, it is a very pretty model nevertheless.

All of this was a bit of a Holy Grail.  When you come to calculate the
interpretations of types like   Pi X. X -> (X->X) -> X,  they turn out
to be the most horrendous mess.   The "coherence space" model in "Proofs
and Types" may well be the only one in which you can give an explicit
desciption of Pi X. X -> X -> X, and even that has four elements, where
there are only two closed lambda terms.

There are of course other ways of finding models of the polymorphic
lambda calculus, such as using the "small complete category" in Hyland's
effective topos, but I'll leave someone else to write about that.

In conclusion, this particular dragon's den has already been explored,
and the corpses are still there to prove it.

   (the series in which "Stone Spaces" by Johnstone and "Introduction
    to Higher Order Categorical Logic" by Lambek and Scott appeared.)

     ISBN: 0-521-63107-6    xii+576 pages    List price: 50 or $80

I understand that the text and cover have now been printed, and are due to
be bound on Monday 22 March in Cambridge, so I expect to see my own copy by
the end of next week; orders should be dispatched after the Easter holiday.

	PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR THE BEST WAY TO ORDER YOUR COPY.

The (not very informative) names of the chapters are:
   I   First Order Reasoning         VI   Structural Recursion
   II  Types and Induction           VII  Adjunctions
   III Posets and Lattices           VIII Algebra with Dependent Types
   IV  Cartesian Closed Categories   IX   The Quantifiers
   V   Limits and Colimits 

The back cover "blurb" reads:
   Practical Foundations collects the methods of construction of the
   objects of twentieth century mathematics. Although it is mainly
   concerned with a framework essentially equivalent to intuitionistic
   ZF, the book looks forward to more subtle bases in categorical type
   theory and the machine representation of mathematics. Each idea is
   illustrated by wide-ranging examples, and followed critically along
   its natural path, transcending disciplinary boundaries between
   universal algebra, type theory, category theory, set theory, sheaf
   theory, topology and programming.

   The first three chapters will be essential reading for the design
   of courses in discrete mathematics and reasoning, especially for the
   ``box method'' of proof taught successfully to first year informatics
   students. Chapters IV, V and VII are an introduction to categorical
   logic. Between the formal languages translations are provided which
   are fluent, showing how to write vernacular proofs which are sound in
   formal logics.  Chapter VI is a new approach to term algebras,
   induction and recursion, which have hitherto only been treated either
   naively or with set theory.

   The last two chapters prove in detail the equivalence of types and
   categories, in particular between generalised algebraic theories and
   categories with display maps.

   Students and teachers of computing, mathematics and philosophy will
   find this book both readable and of lasting value as a reference work.

The web page currently just gives just the list of contents (down to the
names of subsections), but when I have time to work on it I intend use it
to publish many of the specific comments that people have made about the
text (if those people are willing), and provide an interface for making
further comments, and, of course, corrections.  CUP has indicated that
they have no objection to my publishing the entire text on the web in any
form short of a printable DVI or PS file; when I have found a translator
that actually works on my text, I intend to make an HTML version, obviously
without most of the mathematical formulae, to feed to the web crawlers.

			HOW BEST TO ORDER YOUR COPY

This depends on whether you would like to make a large donation to

(a) your bookstore's profits:  just quote the ISBN to them;

(b) CUP's profits: fill in their web order form (no discount, by policy,
                   and you pay cost of postage);

(c) the UK Inland Revenue:  wait until April 6 before you do anything;

(d) the author, who has committed career suicide by writing this book at all.

The special deal that I have negotiated is this.  CUP is ADAMANT that it is
contrary to their policy to give discounts for direct orders, even though
the Web is now clearly the best way of ordering research-level books.
However, by personal arrangement with my editor and the marketing manager,
if you email, fax or phone the marketing manager,
	Richard Knott,   email:  rknott@cup.cam.ac.uk
	tel:  +44 1223 325 916   fax:  +44 1223 315 052,
with your address and credit card number, mentioning that you saw this message
from me, you get the book at list price INCLUSIVE of overland postage
(normally 2.50), and I get some commission.  If you want airmail delivery,
there is an extra 2.50 charge.

If you are not sure whether you actually want to buy the book yet, but you
think you might (or might be teaching a course based on it) please email
Richard Knott and say so, as soon as possible.  If I get evidence of
respectable sales prospects then I might persuade them to pay me an advance
on royalties THIS MONTH - in the tax year during which I was unemployed
for five months - instead of having a lump sum in May 2000 taxed at 40%.

Please, this is important if you think that academic authors deserve some
reward for the labour and demoralisation of eight years writing a book.

50 is pretty good value for a research book of this size.  A recently
announced book on similar material, published by the Dutch company
Elsevier (North-Holland) costs TWICE the price (for 1/3 more pages).
CUP, being part of Cambridge University, has no shareholders and
counts as a charity for tax purposes, and there is no VAT on books in
Britain.  Even so, other recent books of same size in the same series
as mine retail at 65. I kept the price of mine down by doing the
whole of the typographical work myself (of course), and by NOT claiming
the 2350 that I could have got for providing lower quality
camera-ready hard copy instead of PostScript.

The answer is no, because of the application in mind. We want to
consider a graph as a constructive binary relation X(x,y), where an edge
x-->y is a proof that (x,y) are related. We also want to build such
things by induction, using universal properties. Reflexivity is often a
desirable feature of the free structures you want to build, but you
don't want it to come for free, since it creates redundancies and can
mess up the induction principle associated with the structure. In
certain situations you want reflexivity to be a consequence of the
induction principle.

There are two connections I know about between homotopy and computer
science. The first has to do with process algebras, and originates in
Eric Goubault's thesis, I think. Philippe Gaucher just sent a paper
annoucement on this server about this line of research.

The second connection is something Thomas Streicher, Martin Hoffmann and
I discuss whenever we meet, which is not often enough. In constructive
type theory there is a gadget called the Martin-L"of intensional
equality predicate, J(x,y). So this is a version of equality, where you
have to name the proofs that x=y. It has very simple (but rather
mysterious) introduction and elimination rules, which can be translated
as a universal property in a kind of higher-order universal algebra,
where arities can not only be seen as finite sets, but also as families
of sets, and families of families of sets and so on. In particular,
since everything is a type, you have a type/predicate of equality proofs
between equality proofs, and so on. For example given proofs that x=y
and y=z, you can construct a proof that x=z, and you can do this
uniformly, getting a term/algorithm  J(x,y)*J(y,z) --> J(x,z) (here the
* means a fibered product over y). But you cannot show that this
operation is itself associative, it is only associative at a higher
order. Ah! some kind of multiple category is involved! But so far all
attempts to use higher-order categories to describe those weird algebras
have failed. It only works at level one: when you collapse all proofs of
equality between proofs of equality you get that the predicate J(x,y) is
a groupoid structure. But when you try to go to level 2 the ordinary 2-
or bi- or lax- or whatever- categorical machinery fails. You realize
that simplicial sets are a better paradigm/starting point, but we need
simplicial sets with operations.

BTW is anybody from G"oteborg reading this?

Hm... the geometrical motivations for not having full composition(s)
here might well be related to the logical ones I mentioned briefly
above.

Because of my thesis' work (on not-unrelated subjects to those mentioned
by Paul) I had already dealt with permutations in power types when Paul
started pushing his groupoid models. They indeed give rise to "the most
horrendous mess". This was a long time ago, my memory is vague, but I
probably told him, or hinted, that in my opinion they were most likely a
blind alley. I still think that if I started working again in this
field, the problem I would zero in would be to get rid of the
permutation groups, by "unraveling" them by the means of actions (the
groupoid associated with the action of a group on a set can be made much
simpler than the group itself). The point of semantics is to give you
insights about the logic, so simplicity is... a big plus.

And since I refereed his CTCS paper, I *did* read it.

I wonder whether the notion of "h4-category" which I introduced for
abstract homotopy theory (see the references in my first reply) might be of
use for this.

It is a sort of "2-category vertically relaxed up to a 'shadow' of 3-cells"
(whereas bi-categories are horizontally relaxed up to invertible 2-cells).

To begin with, it is a category enriched over reflexive graphs in the sense
previously described: there is a reduced horizontal composition, of maps
with cells and cells with maps, which is strictly associative as far as
this makes sense.
There also are vertical identities, vertical involution and vertical
composition, which only satisfy the usual axioms up to an assigned
equivalence relation ("2-homotopy").
This approach is truncated at the level of usual (first-order) homotopies;
3-cells (homotopies of homotopies) only leave their 'shadow', as an
equivalence relation.

If you want to proceed further, my impression is that the relaxed
categorical machinery becomes too heavy (at least for my taste). However,
if your 2-cells (homotopies) can be represented

- by a cylinder functor  I,  as arrows  IX -> Y,
- or dually by a path functor  P,  as arrows  X -> PY,
     (or by both, forming an adjoint pair  I -| P)

as it happens for most "concrete" homotopy theories, then the powers of
such endofunctor and the clone of operations (natural transformations)
linking them, derived from the basic ones (faces, degeneracy,
concatenation, etc.), seem to give all what we need in any dimension.
This machinery of derived operations can be seen in a paper of mine

Categorically algebraic foundations for homotopical algebra, Appl. Categ.
Structures 5 (1997), 363-413,

but of course "abstract cylinder functors" go back, at least, to Kan; other
references can be found in the paper above.

This is written from the point of view of someone who would like to see a 
computational system which is much nearer to real mathematics than the 
current widely used systems (Maple, Mathematica, and various more 
specialised systems, e.g. Singular). 

Of these the only one which is clearly typed is Singular. There is also 
AXIOM,  which has parametrised types, types can be variables, there 
is multiple inheritance and coercion. It looks much nearer to what should 
be mathematics. On the other hand, its literature 
does not include any theory of the type system, so consistency is not 
clear, and it is not generally used. 

So my question is: does all this general theory of types give a clear 
indication as to what should be, not necessarily a final, but certainly a 
convenient theory adequate for expressing a majority of present day maths?

Let's make up a test case: one should be able to code reasonably 
conveniently the type  of a general groupoid acting on exterior algebras 
over a commutative ring, and also of course the category of such objects. 
A groupoid acting on exterior algebras with zero multiplication should be 
coercible to a groupoid acting on graded modules. 

I would prefer the sytem to be so simple that it will allow tests for 
consistency of new proposed types. Also it should be easy to understand, 
since it would represent nicely current practice. 

Is this idea a mirage?

This would be a great pity.  


Girard's coherence spaces (see "Proofs and Types"), ordinary relational
algebra (in which Shroeder identified the par, writing   +,   for it,
I think,  in 1895)  and my model with groupoids all illustrate a common
theme in the workings of models of linear logic.

In all of these structures, there are extremely natural ways of defining
the structure on disjoint unions and cartesian products,  and of turning
the structure inside out or upside down.  These turn out to be the additive,
multiplicative and negative connectives in linear logic.

There are less natural ways of defining the structure on powersets,
finite powersets and other variations on this theme.  These are the
exponentials.  It is important to note that there are several different
exponential operations available to interpret ! and ? .

Girard got function spaces out of such constructions (as did Francois,
myself and numerous other people).   What I hope to show soon is how to
get higher order logic too.

A 'philosophical' interpretation of oriented graphs might be out of
the scope of the categories mailing list, it seems elucidating to me
though.(It could have been for Heraclit and Parmenides.)

I suggest to consider vertices as states and edges as transitions.

A reflexive edge corresponds to a transition from a state to itself. 

Two notions of morphism of oriented graphs come seem natural:
- A rigid embedding which preserves difference of states
- A notion of morphism which may equalize different states.
The meaning of equality of states needs precision then.

Coherence semantics deals with a different notion of graph.
This is clear to me and can also be deduced from a discussion between
Thomas Ehrhard and his student Pierre to which I assisted.

This bears an answer to the question of reflexivity I think.

	Sincerely, Tom

No, I don't think it's a mirage, though [help me somebody I need a good pun
here] the answer I have in mind may involve some altered states of perception.

For the moment I want to steer clear of the "computational" question,
as I haven't begun work on that, and would like to read his "current
widely used systems" to refer to set theory, elementary toposes,
Martin-Lof type theory and so on.

That being said, I wonder whether the discussion and results in my
	"Abstract Stone Duality"
paper (that I advertised on "categories" in the new year and which
has since been revised) might appeal to Ronnie.

It bases "set theory" on topology and not vice versa.

It identifies categories of open discrete and compact Hausdorff spaces
that are both pretoposes, and therefore suitable for doing algebra in,
though the open discrete spaces are more appropriate for this as they
admit free algebras.

I do, as I said, have a computational model in mind, but am not yet in
a position to say anything about it.

                  Announcement of PhD Studentship in

       The Structure of Programming Languages: Syntax and Semantics


A PhD student is sought for three years from October 1999 to work under 
the supervision of Prof. Gordon Plotkin on a UK EPSRC-funded project:
``The Structure of Programming Languages: Syntax and Semantics.''

The project aims at a general theory of the syntax and semantics of 
programming languages. The student will work on a categorical theory 
of structural operational semantics and its relation to denotational 
semantics. (See http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/dt/lics97.ps.)
Example topics include: variations on GSOS for computational effects 
other than non-determinism; linguistic expressions of categorical 
operational semantics; and a theory of language translation incorporating 
both denotational and operational semantics.

The studentship is for three years and pays for all fees and includes
maintenance (living expenses) at the usual EPSRC rate.

The studentship will be held at the Laboratory for Foundations of
Computer Science (LFCS), Division of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. 

The LFCS provides an ideal environment for postgraduate research. The
first six months of postgraduate training are supported by a unique
postgraduate course on the theory of computation. In addition, there
are regular short courses on advanced research topics, and a number of
forums provide weekly research seminars. The LFCS is particularly strong
in the area of semantics of programming languages.

The PhD studentship is relevant to computer science or mathematics
graduates who are interested in at least one topic from: theory of
programming languages, operational semantics, category theory.

           Argentinian Workshop on Theoretical Computer Science
                      Buenos Aires - Argentina
                         September 6-7, 1999
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------



The 3rd Argentinian Workshop on Theoretical Computer Science (WAIT'99)
will be part on the 28th Argentinean Conference on Informatics and
Operations Research (28 JAIIO), to be held in Buenos Aires from September
6th to September 10th, 1999.

The goal of the workshop is bringing together researchers from academy
(from Argentinean and other universities) and industry professionals in
order to discuss theoretical, empirical and experimental results on the
field of theoretical computer science.

This workshop will consist of invited talks and technical presentations.

Contributions are expected in all the areas of theoretical computer
science, including the following:

* Logical and algebraic foundations for computer science (logics for
computer science, category theory, relation algebras, type theory, etc.),

* Formal program construction (formal specification of sequential and
concurrent programs; analysis, verification and transformation of
programs, etc.),

* Algorithms and data structures (sequential, parallel, distributed,
on-line, probabilistic, etc.),

* Computational complexity,

* Automata theory,

* Graph theory,

* Symbolic and algebraic computation.

The expected contributions will describe original results as well as
undergoing research and development projects on theoretical computer
science coming from academy and industry.

Papers will be refereed by the International Program Committee, based
on the following:

* Papers reporting research / experimental results: these papers must
present previously unpublished results and will be judged based on their
originality, significance, relevance and clarity of presentation.
Authors must submit an extended abstract of up to 4 pages containing
enough information to allow the referees to determine the merits of their
work. It is also allowed to submit the full paper of up to 12 pages
including figures and references.

* Research projects: aiming to fostering the cooperation among national
and foreign researchers, short papers describing ongoing research will
be considered. Papers in this category may report already published
results. In that case, the authors must include the corresponding references.

* Industrial / Commercial applications: also relevant are papers describing
applications of theoretical results to real-life situations. Short papers
describing results that are both of significance for industry and that make
novel or defying applications of theoretical results are sought.

Note from moderator:

Posts sent to the categories list in the past few days (roughly since
March 26) will have bounced back to the sender. The cause was, ironically,
a sendmail patch to scan for the "Melissa" virus/worm that corrupted the
alias database for the majordomo software used by the list. 

If you sent a post recently and have not seen it please resend,things are
working again. Sorry about any delays, and thanks to the Mount Allison
network manager for immediate response when the problem was detected.
