Barry Jay recently sought comments on A^2 is cartesian closed when A is so,
where 2 is the arrow-category. Roy Crole and Peter Johnstone both pointed
out that this was a special case of Artin glueing.

Is there not a more general fact? The forgetful 2-functor from cartesian-
closed categories to categories is fairly easily seen to be monadic - the
monadicity is well-known for categories with finite products or finite
limits, and adding the right adjoint to (- x A) is purely equational. But
for any 2-monad T on K, T-Alg has all lax and pseudo limits - indeed all
flexible limits - formed as in K; see [Blackwell, Kelly, and Power, Two-
-dimensional monad theory, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 50 (1989), 1-41]. Artin
glueing is the case of the lax limit of a map, if I remember correctly its
meaning. But (-)^X for any category X is also a flexible limit, so that
Jay's observation is included directly without recourse to Artin glueing.

Then, again, Michael Barr on 30 Jan asserts that A^X is cartesian closed if
A is so when X is finite and A has finite limits. Surely such conditions are
not needed - A^X is cartesian closed when A is so.

Am I missing something?

Subject: categories: my earlier comments on certain limits in algebras for a 2-category.
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk

After returning home and checking my references, I see that in [Blackwell,
Kelly, Power] we show that, for a 2-monad T on a complete 2-category K, the
category T-Alg, whose morphisms are the non-strict ones (the "to within a
coherent isomorphism" ones), admits products, inserters, and equifiers,
formed as in K, and hence such limits as follow from these, including the
cotensor product (-)^X for an X in K. What I said today about admitting all
FLEXIBLE limits is false; I had misremembered, and there is a counter-
-example in Example 6.2 of [Bird, Kelly, Power, Street, Flexible limits for
2-categories, JPAA 61 (1989), 1 - 27]. The flexibles would follow from those
above if idempotents were to split - but they don't in general.

I am strongly convinced that the above is true. The mere CATEGORY Ccc of
cartesian closed categories was shown to be monadic over the mere category
Cato of categories by Burroni, and this was checked and restated by Dubuc
and Kelly in [J. Algebra 81 (1983), 420 - 433]. Blackwell, Kelly, and Power
claimed on p.39 of [B,K,P] that Ccc, as a 2-category with only invertible
2-cells, is monadic (2-monadic, if you want the repeated emphasis) over the
complete 2-category Catg which is obtained from the 2-category Cat by
discarding all the non-invertible 2-cells. It is most unlikely that Ccc is
2-monadic over the usual 2-category Cat; for already symmetric monoidal
closed categories is known not to be so; see p.34 of [B,K,P].

I had strongly believed that Ccc was indeed 2-monadic over Catg; but we never
checked every detail of this particular example. Today my belief has been
shaken by two letters (one from Barry Jay) claiming that the monadicity of 
Ccc is false, unless the cartesian closed categories are supposed to admit
pullbacks. I shall try to check this out in the coming days - we were quite
sure that the structure is equational even without pullbacks, but perhaps we
were wrong. Certainly Burroni (see [Dubuc-Kelly for the reference) supposed
pullbacks present, because he was headed for toposes.

I must say that the letters I received today were imprecise about which
base 2-category was involved; to be fair, they were not really about 
monadicity but about the existence of A^2. However I formed theimpression
that the 2-categorical investigations in the references above have not (yet?)
become part of the common language of our colleagues. Note that the T-Alg
where these limits are to exist does NOT have the strict maps; so that it is
certainly not monadic in any classical sense. Clearly one cannot begin even
to pose such questions precisely without using 2-categorical notions. Let me
finish by saying that the universal property of A^2 is 2-categorical by its
very nature (if we are speaking of A^2 in T-alg, not just in Cat).

Oh, that's it! I have just seen what the point is. [B,K,P] is quite right in
asserting that Ccc has the limit A^2 formed as in Catg; but the limit A^2 in
Catg is not at all that in Cat; it is the category such that to give
B --> A^2 is to give two maps B --> A and a 2-cell between them; but the
2-cells in Catg are just the INVERTIBLE natural transformations, so that
A^2 in Catg is A^I in Cat, where I is the free isomorphism, not the free a
arrow 2.

So, all right, I give in. The [B,K,P] results don't give a cartesian closed
structure on the USUAL A^2 in Cat. Anyway, I've learned (or relearned)
something from thinking this through, and hope some others may benefit from
seeing these notions brought up.

And so to bed. Max Kelly.

            *** EXTENSION of PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE ***
            ***********************************************

Due to several reasons, the deadline for electronic submission of
extended abstracts to A.P Ershov Third International Conference
"Perspectives in System Informatics" (PSI'99) is extended for 
two weeks as follows:

NEW DEADLINE: February 14, 1999   
   
Call for papers is attached below for your reference.
***********************************************


                        FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS
            Andrei Ershov Third International Conference
                  PERSPECTIVES OF SYSTEM INFORMATICS

        6 - 9 July 1999, Novosibirsk, Akademgorodok, Russia

AIMS AND SCOPE

The conference is held to honour the late Academician Andrei Ershov
(1931-1988) and his outstanding contributions towards advancing
informatics. The first two conferences were held in May 1991 and
June 1996 and proved to be big international events.

Andrei Ershov was one of the early Russian pioneers in the field of
theoretical and systems programming, a founder of the Siberian School

of Computer Science. In 1974 he was nominated as a Distinguished
Fellow of the British Computer Society. In 1981 he received the
Silver Core Award for services rendered to IFIP. Andrei Ershov's
brilliant speeches were always in the focus of public attention.
Especially notable was his lecture on "Aesthetic and human factor in
programming" presented at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference
in 1972. Andrei Ershov was not only an extremely gifted scientist,
teacher and fighter for his ideas, but also a bright and many-sided
personality. He wrote poetry, translated the works of R.Kipling and
other English poets, and enjoyed playing guitar and singing.
Everyone who had the pleasure of knowing Andrei Ershov and working
with him will always remember his great vision, eminent
achievements, and generous friendship.

The aim of the Conference is to provide a forum for the presentation
and in-depth discussion of advanced research directions in Computer
Science. For a developing science, it is important to work out
consolidating ideas, concepts and models. Movement in this direction
is one of the goals the Conference is to meet. Improvement of the
contacts and exchange of ideas between researchers from the East and
West are further goals.

CONFERENCE TOPICS

Conference topics include:

              Semantics-Based Program Processing
- program specification, transformation, and verification,
- semantics, logic and formal models of programs,
- partial evaluation, mixed computation, and abstract interpretation,
- program analysis, understanding and visualization.

              Program Methodology and Information Technologies:
- object-oriented programming,
- generic programming,
- parallel and distributed computing,
- database and information systems.

              Artificial Intelligence:
- knowledge engineering,
- natural language processing,
- AI tools and applications
- constraint programming and multi-agent technology.

In addition to papers in the above list of topics, papers both
bridging the gap between different directions and promoting mutual
understanding of researchers in different directions are welcome.
Papers defining the prospects of Computer Science in the whole and
joint West-East papers are also encouraged.

LOCATION

The conference will be held in Akademgorodok (Academy town), 30 km
South from Novosibirsk, the largest city of Siberia. Akademgorodok is
located in a picturesque place near the Ob lake. It is surrounded
with birch and pine forests and pleasant not only for work but for
recreation as well. Silence, beautiful landscape, and pure air are
the factors promoting scientific activity and creativity.

  State Graph Manipulators (SGM) is a high-level state-graph manipulation 
  tool for verification non-experts as well as experts. After the release
  of SGM v1.1 which was a more stable version, we are now releasing SGM v1.2
  which has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows more logical
  and flexible manipulation of state-graphs. SGM v1.2 with GUI 
  is now ready for downloading. This version provides both three interfaces:
  batch, interactive, and graphical user interface.

                            "Important NOTE"
  Those who downloaded SGM v1.1 recently are strongly advised to download
  SGM v1.2 which provides not only a GUI, but also removes some program bugs.

                     Changes in v1.2 from v1.1

(1) A Graphical User Interface (GUI) provided for a more user-friendly
    verification environment as well as for demonstrating how state-graphs
    can be reduced by different manipulators (reduction techniques).
    The SGM GUI provides not only all the functionalities that were present 
    in the interactive/batch modes, but also some new facilities like
    graph viewing, renaming, printing, saving, and input file editing, etc.
    On-line help is provided in the GUI.
(2) Memory usage further reduced to 1/10th of that originally 
    required in SGM v1.0 and 4/5th of that required in SGM v1.1. 
    Memory leaks removed using Purify, a commercial program debugging 
    tool from Rational Software.
(3) All 5 application examples that were included with v1.1 distribution,
    can now be directly loaded into the GUI by just some clicks of a mouse
    button.
    (a) Fischer's Mutual Exclusion Protocol,
    (b) CSMA/CD Protocol,
    (c) Token Ring Network,
    (d) PATHO OS Priority-Based Task Execution, and
    (e) Bus Arbiter.
(4) User manual updated to version 1.2.
(5) Further programming bugs/errors fixed.

Visit URL: "http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~eric/sgm/" to download SGM v1.2.
SGM web site completely renewed for easier download and access.

Concerning the question by Lindquist:

The tensor product automatically satisfies all functoriality, 
associativity and coherence conditions, if it is introduced by a 
universal property as by Bourbaki. This is shown for monoidal 
categories (bicategories with one object) e.g. in my paper 
``Multicategories revisited'', Contemporary Mathematics 92(1989). The 
same argument works for arbitrary bicategories provided, in defining 
a multicategory, one replaces the free monoid generated by a set by 
the free category generated by a graph.

In view of this would it be fair to say that coherence is not a notion
intrinsic to category theory, but rather arises from the traditional
set theoretic presentation (or at least point of view) of category theory?

Much the same can surely be said of naturality, whose abstract essence
is that of 2-cells but which is standardly presented concretely, where
the interchange axiom becomes a not entirely trivial theorem.

I think it's fair to say that operations automatically satisfy all
the right coherence laws if you define them using universal properties.
This is the idea behind Jim Dolan's and my definition of weak n-categories:
all the ways of composing cells are defined by means of universal properties,
so one doesn't need to explicitly list coherence laws - they're automatic.

Indeed, if you ask what are the "right" coherence laws, perhaps the 
easiest answer is: the coherence laws automatically satisfied by universal 
constructions!   (There are also some answers coming from homotopy theory
but probably deep down they are the same answer.)

We pound these points home with great rhetorical flourishes in the 
following paper:

Categorification, in Higher Category Theory, eds. Ezra Getzler and

Here is a new paper of mine that may be interesting to fans of
categories and n-categories:

Higher-Dimensional Algebra and Planck-Scale Physics

to appear in "Physics Meets Philosophy at the Planck Scale", eds. 
Craig Callender and Nick Huggett, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge.

This is a nontechnical introduction to recent work on quantum gravity
that uses ideas from higher-dimensional algebra.  We argue that reconciling
general relativity with the Standard Model requires a `background-free
quantum theory with local degrees of freedom propagating causally'.  We
describe the insights provided by work on topological quantum field theories
such as quantum gravity in 3-dimensional spacetime.  These are background-free
quantum theories lacking local degrees of freedom, so they only display some
of the features we seek.  However, they suggest a deep link between the
concepts of `space' and `state', and similarly those of `spacetime' and
`process', which we argue is to be expected in any background-free quantum
theory.  We sketch how higher-dimensional algebra provides the mathematical
tools to make this link precise.  Finally, we comment on attempts to formulate
a theory of quantum gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime using `spin networks'
and `spin foams'.

I am not sure whether his "course 2-categories" is my associative

Obstructions to Coherence:  Natural Noncoherent Associativity

Abstract
We study what happens when coherence fails. Categories
with a tensor product and a natural associativity isomorphism
that does not necessarily satisfy the pentagon coherence
requirements (called associative categories) are considered.
Categorical versions  of associahedra where naturality squares 
commute and pentagons do not are constructed (called Catalan 
groupoids, $\An$). These groupoids are used in the construction of the
free associative category. They are also used in the
construction of the theory of associative categories (given as a 2-sketch).
Generators and relations are given for the fundamental group, $\pi(\An)$, 
of the Catalan groupoids -- thought of as a simplicial complex. These 
groups are shown to be more than just free groups. Each associative 
category, $\bf B$, has related fundamental groups $\pi(\bf
B_n)$ and homomorphisms $\pi(P_n):\pi(\An) \longrightarrow \pi(\bf
B_n)$. If the images of the $\pi(P_n)$ are trivial, i.e. there is only
one associativity path between any two objects, then the category is
coherent. Otherwise the images of $\pi(P_n)$ are obstructions to
coherence. Some progress is made in classifying noncoherence of 
associative categories.

Yes, but Bourbaki's universal properties required for the  isomorphism 
A(BC) ---> (AB)C is that a(bc) |---> (ab)c (see Algebre II.64). 
Mac Lane's classical counterexample a(bc)|--->(-1)(ab)c 
surely does not satisfy this coherence condition (page 163 of CWM). 
By the way, the fundamental group that corresponds to this
associative category is Z_2 since going around once does not give 
the identity but going around twice does.

The whole point of my paper is that there are no "right" coherence laws.
Each structure has interesting theorems that can be proven about it.
Finding the "right" coherence axioms is like finding the "right" axioms to
study symmetry. Which one is "right": semi-groups, groups, Abelian groups
Lie groups etc.? If coherence theory is to be thought of as some type of
higher-dimensional algebra, then there are many structures that are of
interest.

Hi,

In a lax-natural transformation F->G:A->B the 'lax' naturality condition is
expressed in terms of a natural transformation tau:B(n(a),1);G(a,b)->B(1,n(b));F(a,b)
for 0-cells a,b:A. Is there some good reason why tau is in this direction and not
the opposite?

Dear Colleagues,
  This message is to announce that the Program for this year's MFPS meeting
is now available on line. The meeting will take place on the campus of
Tulane University from April 28 to May 1. 
  We also want to announce that following MFPS a short course on the NRL
Protocol Analyzer will be offered at Tulane by Dr. Catherine Meadows (NRL),
the chief developer of the NRL Protocol Analyzer. The course is free, but
it is open to a limited enrollment of 20 participants. It will take place
from Monday, May 3 to Wednesday, May 5, with a continuation to Thursday,
May 6 if there is sufficient interest.
  Details about the MFPS program, about registration procedures and about
the NRL Protocol Analyzer course can be found at the MFPS XV home page,
http://www.math.tulane.edu/mfps15.html. Because of an overlap with the
annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, we urge potential
participants to register and make travel arrangements by February 15. 
  Best regards,
  Mike Mislove

The School of Mathematical and Computing Sciences at the Chalmers
University of Technology and Göteborgs University announces new PhD
positions in several subjects including Computing Science.

The Department of Computing Science, part of the Schol, has about 30
staff members and about 25 PhD students.  The department receives
funding from Esprit, and from the Swedish Government agencies TFR and
NUTEK.  The major topics of research are programming logic and type
theory, functional programming, formal systems, cognition technology,
distributed systems, concurrency, and algorithms, but research is not
restricted to these.

PhD positions are limited to at most five years. Usually, a PhD
student will spend about 80 percent of his or her time on graduate
studies, and about 20 percent on teaching. Applicants must have an
undergraduate degree in Computing Science or in a related subject with
a strong Computing Science component. You may also apply if your
undergraduate degree is not complete but is expected to be finished by
September 1, 1999. The School aims to increase the number of female
employees, and especially welcomes female applicants. At the moment,
the salary amounts to 16200 SEK per month in the first year.

More information about the graduate programmes can be found on the WWW
on page:

  http://www.md.chalmers.se/Jobs/PhD/phd-en.thtml

which also has a pointer to an electronic application form. You are
encouraged to use this, as it will get your application immediately
registered with the School. However, you will have to send more
information to complete your application.

The full application consists of a letter in English, covering

  1 data about yourself;
  2 a copy of an official paper giving grades from your undergraduate
    degree(s); 
  3 a statement about your main interests;
  4 some letters of recommendation from people that know you as a student
    or as an employee;
  5 any scientific papers you have written.

Send your application to 

  Section for Mathematics and Computer Science
  Chalmers University of Technology
  412 96 Gothenburg
  Sweden

The last date for your application to arrive is 1 March 1999.
Incomplete or late applications risk rejection. We expect to tell you
the result of your application by 1 June 1999.

It will help if you also send whatever details can be sent by by e-mail to

  prasad@cs.chalmers.se

More information about the Department can be found at

Dear Colleagues
Apologies. Buffalo's email central has been down for several days and
won't be fixed until Tuesday. That includes storage of all your messages 
that I was going to answer.

Urgent items of yours can be resent to wlawvere@hotmail.com.

Especially note that those who will be speaking at the Special Session
of the April 24-25 AMS Meeting here should send an abstract to the
AMS before MARCH 3 if they wish to be listed in the program.( The 
instuctions I was going to send concerning this are temporarily 
unretrievable, but) The ams.org webpage contains instuctions for 
submission of abstracts : the number of the meeting is #943 and the name 
of the Special Session I'm organizing is Smooth Categories in Geometry 
and Mechanics (Code: AMS SS A1)

As we are told, academics and computers all need Restructuring.
Consequently, my email address is now

        street@math.mq.edu.au

and my homepage site is now

        http://www.math.mq.edu.au/~street/

Members of the British Empire, can replace "math" by "maths" without a problem.


[[[Behind the scenes what is happening is that our old machine "macadam"
will soon die and I am using a new machine called "hera".  Our old "School
of Mathematics, Physics, Computing and Electronics" (this is where the
previous reference to MPCE came from) has restructured to become the
"Division of Information and Communication Science" but I cannot believe
that I belong in such a place.  Luckily our computer services friends have
allowed us to by-pass this Division terminology and have enabled the easily
remembered

        math.mq.edu.au

given that "mq" stands for "Macquarie" and "au" for "Australia".  Note that
supporters of the name of the new Division understandably prefer "Division
of ICS" to the natural shorter acronyms "DICS" and "DOICS". ]]]

Yours progressively,
Ross Street

                      WORKSHOP  ANNOUNCEMENT 

                  *** SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS ***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


  FLoc'99 Workshop         (affiliated to LICS'99)

  IMLA: Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications

  July 6, 1999
  Trento, Italy


BACKGROUND

  Intuitionistic and modal logics are of foundational relevance to
  Computer Science and both have led to successful applications in the
  formal specification and verification of computer systems. The
  intuitionistic and the modal frameworks are usually investigated
  separately.  However, a growing body of published work, stimulated by
  theoretical considerations and fed by various applications in Computer
  Science, shows that both paradigms may fruitfully be merged.

  Intuitionistic modal logic (IML) and modal type theory (MTT) can exploit
  both the proof-theoretic strengths of intuitionistic logic and the
  model-theoretic features of modal logics. The potential and the
  challenge of IML and MTT both lie in finding a satisfactory combination
  of its intensional and its extensional aspects.  We intend this one-day
  workshop to seed a more concerted organisation of the ongoing research
  in the area of IML, bringing together the method-oriented and the
  problem-oriented approaches on the one hand, and the proof-theoretic and
  model-theoretic ones on the other. This will create fruitful research
  stimuli through the friction between engineering applications and pure
  theory, and between intensional and extensional lines of thinking.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

  Contributions are invited on all aspects of the theory and application
  of IML and MTT.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  * applications of intuitionistic necessity or possibility,
    strong monads, or evaluation modalities

  * use of IML and MTT to formalize mechanisms of abstraction
    and refinement

  * applications of IML and MTT to formal verification, abstract
    interpretation, and program analysis and optimization

  * applications of modal types to integration of inductive and
    co-inductive types, higher-order abstract syntax, strong 
    functional programming

  * extraction of constraints or programs, nonstandard information
    extraction techniques

  * Curry-Howard correspondence between computational lambda
    calculi and computational logics

  * extensions of this correspondence by other modalities or
    quantifiers

  * models of IML such as algebraic, categorical, Kripke, topological,
    realizability interpretations

  * notions of proof for IML and intermediate constructive logics

  * proof search in and implementations of IML


FORMAT

  The workshop will be an informal one-day meeting with invited
  talk, regular paper presentations, and discussion. 


INVITED SPEAKER 

  Frank Pfenning (Pittsburgh)


PUBLICATION

  The final versions of all workshop papers will be made available on the
  workshop web page. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit
  full and revised versions for a special journal issue of Mathematical

                               Call for Papers

               Special Issue of the Journal of Automated Reasoning

                                  SAT 2000
  
               (satisfiability at the start of the year 2000)

                               Guest Editors:   
              
                          Ian P. Gent and Toby Walsh
                          University of Strathclyde

                                Review Panel:

      Endre Boros     Olivier Dubois      John Franco      Allen Van Gelder
      Henry Kautz     David McAllester    David Plaisted   Paul Purdom
      Bart Selman     Mark Stickel        Hantao Zhang

In the 1990's, there has been an explosion of research into propositional 
satisfiability (or SAT). There are many factors behind the increased interest 
in this area.  One factor is the improvement of search procedures for SAT.   
New local search procedures like GSAT and WalkSAT are able to solve SAT 
problems with thousands of variables.  At the same time, implementations of 
complete search algorithms like Davis-Putnam have been able to solve open 
mathematical problems.  Another factor is the identification of hard SAT 
problems at a phase transition in solubility.  A third factor is the 
demonstration that we can often solve real world problems by encoding them 
into SAT.  The 1990's have also seen an improved theoretical understanding 
of SAT, particularly in the analysis of phase transition behaviour.  In light
of this, there will be a special issue of the Journal of Automated Reasoning, 
SAT 2000, on the state of the art for research into satisfiability as we move 
into the year 2000.

Topics
-------

We will consider empirical, theoretical or application oriented papers about
SAT. Possible topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

  * Algorithms 
        Complete algorithms
        Local search procedures
        Novel approaches (e.g. combinations of local and complete
        search, genetic algorithms and quantum computers)
        Learning 
        Heuristics
        Implementation efficiencies

   * Analysis
        Theoretical results (e.g. average and worst case behaviour)
        Empirical models (e.g. heavy-tails, run-time distributions)
        Phase transition behaviour
        Approximate models of search cost

   * Applications 
        Hardware verification & design
        Finite mathematics (e.g. quasigroup existence)
        Encodings (e.g. planning and scheduling)
        SAT benchmarks and challenges
        Comparisons with other areas (e.g Constraints and OR)

   * Extensions
        Non-clausal formulae
        Linear 0-1 constraints
        Quantified Boolean formulae (QSAT)
        Modal satisfiability

Prospective contributors are warmly invited to contact either, or both, of 
the guest editors to discuss the suitability of topics and papers. We
especially welcome papers that discuss practical applications. In addition
to presenting new research,  all papers should provide a brief summary
of their area so that outsiders can have an overview of the state of research
into SAT at the start of the new millennium.

Submission
-----------

Please send 3 copies of your manuscript or (preferably) a postscript file to:

           Dr. Ian Gent
           Department of Computer Science
           University of Strathclyde
           Glasgow G1 1XH

           Phone: +44 141 548 4527
           Fax:   +44 141 552 5330

Timetable
----------

To ensure topicality of the special issue, submissions, reviewing and
revision of papers will be held to very fixed and tight deadlines. 

        Submission deadline               1st March 1999
        Initial reviews returned          3rd May 1999
        Revised papers re-submitted       1st June 1999
        Final decision                    1st July 1999
        LaTeX and PS files to Kluwer      1st August 1999
        Publication of special issue      January 2000

To help us achieve this tight timetable, we have approached eminent researchers
to form a review panel, although final decisions on papers will rest with
the guest editors in collaboration with the editor of JAR.  We will also 
expect authors of submitted papers to help with reviewing to this timetable.

    Master of Science degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

    The Division of Informatics offers three 1 year courses
    in different topics in Informatics:


        1. MSc in Artificial Intelligence, whose primary focus is on
        development and understanding of intelligent computational processes
        for the benefit of both creating useful artifacts and helping better
        understand intelligence (human or otherwise). The course contains
        five themes: Foundations of AI, Intelligent Robotics, Knowledge-based
        Systems, Natural Language Processing, and Non-Symbolic AI.

        2. MSc in Cognitive Science and Natural Language. This MSc is
        concerned with computational, formal and experimental approaches
        to understanding cognition and natural language. In Cognitive Science,
        the disciplines of formal linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and
        philosophy are brought together in different kinds of computational
        frameworks. This MSc is particularly concerned with how language is
        represented and processed.
     
        3. The MSc in Computer Science contains three themes. The Advanced
        Computer Systems theme embraces the theory and practice of designing
        programmable systems. The Systems Level Integration theme teaches
        the principles underlying the design of integrated software and
        hardware systems in silicon. The Theoretical Computer Science theme
        introduces students to core areas of theoretical Computer Science and
        to the technologies through which theory-based tools are implemented.
    
    From October to April students attend taught modules.
    During the period May - September inclusive, each student
    undertakes a major practical project under the supervision of a
    member of academic staff. The projects can involve industrial 
    collaboration and may be proposed by the student.

    These courses have been approved by the UK Engineering and Physical
    Science Research Council for the tenure of Advanced Course Studentships
    (about 40 across the three courses).        

    In general, students should have a good BS/BSc degree (or equivalent)
    in an appropriate topic, plus other skills approporate to the particular
    MSc course.

This school is organised by the PhD Programme "Logic in Computer
Science". It aims at providing a general introduction into categorical
logic and type theory.  Moreover, two important concepts in this
context, sheaves and fibered categories, will be considered in more
detail. Ideally, at the end of the week connections and interrelations
between these topics will have evolved and the students have ideas of
the relations of categorical logic to their own research.

Stanford Computer-Science Professor Creates a Pocket-Sized Web Server

By KELLY McCOLLUM   

Watch where you step in the computer-science department at Stanford
University. There may be a Web server hiding under that scrap of
paper.

Vaughan Pratt, a professor of computer science at Stanford, has
created what he says is the world's smallest World-Wide Web server, a
computer that is capable of sending images, sounds, or text to Web
surfers around the world. But unlike most such computers, Mr. Pratt's
Web server is not quite as tall and wide as a business card, and only
a quarter of an inch thick.

Mr. Pratt says he made the device "initially just for the impact."
But, he says, the computer also makes a point about the shrinking size
and cost -- and growing power -- of general-purpose computers like his
Web server.

"Fifty years ago, a computer with less computational power than a
modern pocket calculator filled a whole room, and ran programs
consisting of only a few hundred instructions," Mr. Pratt says on his
Web site. "Today we can fit the extensive software needed to drive a
World-Wide Web server into a computer the size of a box of matches."
The Web server was partially an answer to the previous record holder,
a tiny server designed by a software company in Cambridge, Mass. That
earlier server was an "embedded system" -- a computer constructed to
perform a specific task. Embedded systems are useful because they are
inexpensive and run their programs reliably. General-purpose machines,
like personal computers, have multiple uses, but are more complex and
expensive.

However, says Mr. Pratt, the general-purpose computers have dropped so
far in price that they may be more economical than embedded systems in
some cases. And in the case of a Web server, a general-purpose machine
is desirable because its software can be easily replaced or upgraded.
Mr. Pratt's server uses a 486 processor, like those found in older
personal computers, and runs the Linux operating system. He adapted
the Web server from a computer that costs about $400. The challenge
was paring down the powerful Linux operating system to fit into the
server's 16 megabytes of storage space and getting it to communicate
with the Internet.

The tiny computer's only job so far has been self-promotion: It serves
up a Web pag with photographs of itself, information about its
hardware, and detailed instructions for creating similar servers
(http://wearables.stanford.edu/).

According to Mr. Pratt, the server has sent out about 120,000 pages in
the past month. He says it could handle a hit per second, although it
hasn't been that busy yet.

The hardware that makes the server possible is what is commonly called
a "computer on a chip." Unlike most personal computers, which are
built from many pieces of hardware -- a processor, memory chips, a
hard drive, and so on -- the tiny server has all its components
integrated on a single circuit board. That concept has been
increasingly used in the personal-computer industry, which has begun
integrating components like sound cards and modems as a way of cutting
manufacturing costs.

Mr. Pratt adds that wearable computers -- complete with eyeglass
displays and wrist-mounted keyboards -- are prime uses of tiny
computers like his Web server.

Mr. Pratt says the tiny server would probably not work for a Web site
with heavy traffic. But it could be useful where a server was needed
only temporarily or where a mobile server was necessary -- perhaps for
scientists hoping to serve up pages from remote places.

    PhD degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

In 1998, the University of Edinburgh established a Division of
Informatics, to study the structure, behaviour and
interactions of both natural and artificial computational systems.
The Division reflects the University's vision of Informatics
as a fundamental area of study, critical for the future developments
in science, engineering, and society. The Division was formed from
the former Departments of Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive
Science and Computer Science.

The Division has positions for new research degree students pursing
either an MSc(Research) (one year), an MPhil (two years) or a PhD
(three years) through investigation of open problems in Informatics.

The Division now contains over 75 academic staff, 66 contract researchers
and about 100 research students, grouped primarily into these research
institutes:

	Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute
	Institute of Computing Systems Architecture
	Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation
	Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems
	Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour

Dear Category Theorists,

The paper "Control Categories and Duality: on the Categorical
Semantics of the Lambda-Mu Calculus" is now available from

 http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~selinger/papers.html
 http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/SelingerP

This is a revised and improved version of a paper I presented at
MFPS'98.

Let me briefly summarize the part of the paper that I think will be
the most interesting to category theorists; the actual abstract is
appended at the end.

Consider a category C with distributive finite products and coproducts
and a distinguished object R, such that all exponentials of the form
R^A exist. Let R^C denote the full subcategory of C consisting of
objects of the form R^A. It is an old observation that R^C is
cartesian-closed. This observation is at the heart of continuation
passing style (CPS) interpretations of programming languages with
control operators, and it has been used recently by Hofmann and
Streicher to give a sound and complete categorical model of Parigot's
lambda-mu calculus.  (The lambda-mu calculus generalizes the
simply-typed lambda calculus; it is a proof term calculus for
propositional classical logic).

In this paper, I give an independent, algebraic characterization of
the structure of categories of the form R^C. By "independent", I mean
that it does not depend on an ambient category C, and by "algebraic",
that it is given in terms of operations and equations only.  The
crucial structure that R^C has, besides cartesian closure, is an
operation called "classical disjunction" that takes R^A and R^B to
R^(AxB). This operation is functorial in each argument, but not
bifunctorial; it forms a premonoidal structure in the sense of Power
and Robinson. Abstracting from R^C, I define the class of "control
categories", which are cartesian-closed categories with a premonoidal
structure and suitable axioms. The presence of an operation which is
not bifunctorial leads to some interesting twists, as one has to be a
bit careful about how one defines concepts such as weak
structure-preserving functors and equivalences of categories.

The main theorem is a structure theorem, which shows that every
control category is equivalent to a category of the form R^C (and, of
course, vice versa).

An algebraic class of categories calls out for an internal language. I
prove that the call-by-name lambda-mu calculus (with product and
disjunction types) forms an internal language for control
categories. Thus, these categories can be considered as models for (a
certain kind of) proof theory of classical logic.  Also, the
call-by-value lambda-mu-calculus forms an internal language for the
dual class of co-control categories. As a consequence of this
categorical duality, it follows that there is a syntactic duality
between the call-by-name and the call-by-value calculus, i.e., there
are mutually inverse translations between call-by-name and
call-by-value that preserve the categorical (and also the operational)
semantics.  Such dualities have been observed in a different setting
by Filinski. In the case of the lambda-mu calculus, such a syntactic
duality was conjectured by Streicher and Reus.

Comments are welcome.

Best wishes, -- Peter Selinger

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ABSTRACT: 

We give a categorical semantics to the call-by-name and call-by-value
versions of Parigot's lambda-mu calculus with disjunction types. We
introduce the class of control categories, which combine a
cartesian-closed structure with a premonoidal structure in the sense
of Power and Robinson.  We prove, via a categorical structure theorem,
that the categorical semantics is equivalent to a CPS semantics in the
style of Hofmann and Streicher. We show that the call-by-name
lambda-mu calculus forms an internal language for control categories,
and that the call-by-value lambda-mu calculus forms an internal
language for the dual co-control categories. As a corollary, we obtain
a syntactic duality result: there exist syntactic translations between
call-by-name and call-by-value which are mutually inverse and which
preserve the operational semantics.  This answers a question of
Streicher and Reus.

To all who work in category theory:

Today, my colleague Keith Williamson demonstrated an "industrial-strength" 
application of category theory.  He applied The Kestrel Institute's 
Specware(TM) system to generate a fairly large program from formal 
specifications.  The program optimizes the placement of electrical 
equipment in an airliner, minimizing wiring subject to constraints 
on how the equipment can be placed.

This is a demonstration of applied research, not yet in technology transfer.  
That having been said, the engineers are finding the program Keith generated 
to be potentially of great use.  Of more significance, though, is their 
interest in the way the program was developed: It can be either improved or 
adapted to other applications by modifying specifications and diagrams of 
specification morphisms, and then replaying the software generation---as 
opposed to having to work with the code.  Efficiency improvements to the 
code have already been demonstrated by working in this mode.  Our slogan 
is  "Re-use specifications, not software".

I don't want to oversell this thing; the devil is in the details, as usual, 
and much more work needs to be done on this approach.  But I'm obviously 
proud of the accomplishment.  When I started our project about four years 
ago, most here thought that applying category theory to anything was a crazy 
notion; others thought that applications, if any, would be 12 to twenty 
years out (depending on to whom we were talking).  Last year we had a

"OK, now scale it up."---and we did!

Ross Street has had an item giving an overview of our work linked to his 
home page for some time now.  We have a paper accepted in the Journal of 
Intelligent Manufacturing, but I don't know when it will appear.

Title : Homotopy invariants of multiple categories and concurrency in computer
science



Abstract :   We associate to any (strict) multiple category $\C$ three
homology theories : the first one is called the globular homology
and it contains the oriented loops of $\C$ ; both other ones are called
corner homology, the
negative one and the positive one, which contain the corners included
in $\C$. We show up the link between this homology theories and the
homotopy of paths in multiple category.  At the end of the paper, we
explain the reason why this theories are interesting for some
geometric problems coming from computer science.

I would like to announce the following paper, which has been posted on
my www site <http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~rags>.  (The McGill ftp site is
currently not functionning, but as soon as it is restored, this paper
ought to appear on the Hypatia mirror site as well.)

Introduction to linear bicategories

by J.R.B. Cockett, J. Koslowski, R.A.G. Seely

Linear bicategories are a generalization of the notion of a bicategory,
in which the one horizontal composition is replaced by two (linked)
horizontal compositions. These compositions provide a semantic model for
the tensor and par of linear logic: in particular, as composition is
fundamentally noncommutative, they provides a suggestive source of
models for noncommutative linear logic.

In a linear bicategory, the logical notion of complementation becomes a
natural linear notion of adjunction. Just as ordinary adjoints are
related to (Kan) extensions, these linear adjoints are related to the
appropriate notion of linear extension.

There is also a stronger notion of complementation, which arises, for
example, in cyclic linear logic. This sort of complementation is
modelled by cyclic adjoints. This leads to the notion of a *-linear
bicategory and the coherence conditions which it must satisfy. Cyclic
adjoints also give rise to linear monads: these are, essentially, the
appropriate generalization (to the linear setting) of Frobenius
algebras.

A number of examples of linear bicategories arising from different
sources are described, and a number of constructions which result in
linear bicategories are indicated.

This paper is dedicated to Jim Lambek, as part of the celebration of his
75th birthday.
