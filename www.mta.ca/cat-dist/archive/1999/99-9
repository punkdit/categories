I wrote to Jack Duskin and asked for news on Isbell.  This is his reply.
I very much regret that I think the John Isbell we all knew and respected
enormously is probably gone forever.  The person may still be there, but
the mathematician is probably not and that is what made him what he was.

I saw John yesterday and for the first time it was clear that he recognized
me as soon as I walked in by greeting me by name. He is still very weak and
drifts in and out. There have been some setbacks, but on the whole, he is
still making progress. They hope to transfer him to rehab center near his
appartment as soon as he gets a little more strength. Keep your fingers
crossed! I will see him again on Sunday. Regards, Jack

Mike perhaps you could post this to the net as a reply to your , I feel,
overly pessimistic view of John's condition:


	Mike, your pessimistic view of John's condition is not shared by
those of us who have seen him in Buffalo. People who have been in a
prolonged coma may take months to return to normal functioning and even
then require equally long periods of rehabilitation. René Lavendhomme told
me this summer about his experience and mental confusion after a prolonged
coma..."and then I even had to re-learn to walk!". People who know him now
would never know that he had had such a terrible experience. I hope that
that will be the case with John as well. Knowing him I can well imagine him
quoting Mark Twain to us: " The reports of my demise have been greatly
exaggerated."

Here is an amusing observation, doubtless of no importance.  In the middle
of a talk at Boulder in, I think, 1987, Bob Pare' came up with a class of
exotic dinatural endotransformations on the homfunctor on Set.  Namely,
for an endomorphism t: X --> X, let t |--> n where n depends only the
cardinality of the fixpoint set of t.  Since, for f: X --> Y and g: Y -->
X, fg and gf have isomorphic fixpoint sets, this turns out to be
dinatural.  The fact that Fix(fg) is isomoprhic to Fix(gf) is perfectly
general in any category that has the equalizer used to define them.  In
particular, this is true in Set\op and so we can get non-Pare' dinats by
using the same formula, but making n depend instead on the cofixpoint set
of t, where that is the coequalizer of t and the identity.  It is easy to
find examples of endomorphisms that have the same fixpoint set, but
different cofixpoint sets and vice versa, so tere are genuinely new.  Are
there any others?  I don't know.

I started thinking about this after a note from Vaughan Pratt who was
interested in Chu(Set,2) (Surprise!).  He had noted that there was a full
subcategory of chusets of the form (A,0) and you could treat their
endomorphisms separately.  That full subcategory is essentially Set and so
you on that subcategory you can use all the Pare' and non-Pare' dinats.
Leaving those aside, you can do dinatural endotransformations of the
internal hom functor in four ways:  If (A,X) is an object, then an
internal endoarrow is a 4-tuple (f,s,a,x) where f: A --> A, s: X --> X, a
in A and x in X subject to <fa,x> = <a,sx> for all a in A and all x in X.
The nth power of such a 4-tuple is simply <f^n,s^n,a,x>.  Then you can
define dinats by letting (f,s,a,x) |--> (f,s,a,x)^n where n depends on
Fix(f) and Fix(s) OR on Cofix(f) and Cofix(s) OR on Fix(f) and Cofix(s) OR
on Cofix(f) and Fix(s).

Qeustion: Are there any dinats on the internal homfunctor on vector
spaces?  I almost have an argument for finite dimensional spaces, but it
depends on writing every endomorphism as a sum of rank one endomorphisms.

Michael

                Submission Deadline: November 15, 1999


OBJECTIVES OF THE WORKSHOP 
--------------------------
Graphical representations and graphs are extremely useful to model 
complex structures in many fields of computer science. 
Graph transformation is the rule-based manipulation of such graphs.
The final workshop of APPLIGRAPH and GETGRATS intends to bring together 
leading researchers in theory and application of graph transformation 
and researchers in other areas of ETAPS who are interested in graph 
transformation. For this reason, this workshop is not restricted to
members of the teams of APPLIGRAPH and GETGRATS, but open for anybody. 
The contributions during the workshop will be based on extended
abstracts selected by an international program committee.
After the workshop two special issues of journals will be published 
focusing on selected contributions of the workshop.  

Further Information:
APPLIGRAPH: http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/grp/ag-ti/appligraph/
GETGRATS: http://www.di.unipi.it/~andrea/GETGRATS/

MAIN TOPICS 
-----------
Major topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: 

Fundamentals:   Node, edge and hyperedge replacement,   
                algebraic and logical approaches, 
                term graph rewriting, 
                graph theoretical properties,
                concurrency, distributivity and semantics, 
                high-level replacement systems, 
                structuring concepts, 
                analysis techniques for graphs and graph transformation.

Applications:   languages and tools based on graph transformation, 
                application of graph transformation to 
                        visual languages, 
                        database and information systems, 
                        concurrent and distributed systems, 
                        CSCW,
                        distributed business process reengineering, 
                        design/implementation of programming languages, 
                        software engineering. 

FORM AND SIZE OF CONTRIBUTIONS 
------------------------------
Submitted extended abstracts of about 8 LNCS pages should report 
recent and ongoing research work. 
Electronic submission to gratra2000@tfs.cs.tu-berlin.de is strongly
recommended.  
We would like to encourage people to submit full papers to the main
conferences of ETAPS 2000 and allow to have extended abstracts of the
the same subject as submission for GRATRA 2000, in parallel. If both are
accepted, the lecture will be held at the ETAPS conference, but also
announced during GRATRA 2000.

			Third Call for Papers

		     Third International Workshop

		  ``Frontiers of Combining Systems''
			     FroCoS'2000

		  March 22-24, 2000, Nancy, France

	     http://www.loria.fr/conferences/frocos2000/

	   DEADLINE FOR PAPER SUBMISSIONS: OCTOBER 1, 1999
                                           ***************

In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,
program development and proof, artificial intelligence, there is an
obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference mechanisms
for special tasks. In order to be usable in practice, these
specialized systems must be combined with each other, and they must be 
integrated into general purpose systems.  The development of general 
techniques for the combination and integration of special systems has
been initiated in many areas.

The two previous international workshops on ``Frontiers of Combining
Systems'' were held in Munich (1996) and in Amsterdam (1998). 
Like its predecessors, FroCoS'2000 is intended to offer a common
forum for research activities in the general area of combination and 
integration of systems, and on their practical use. 

Suggested, but not exclusive topics of interest for the workshop are: 

 * combination of logics 

 * combination of constraint solving techniques, of decision procedures,
   of term rewriting systems

 * combination of deduction systems and computer algebra

 * integration of decision procedures and other solving processes into
   constraint programming and deduction systems 

 * modelisation of hybrid systems 

 * logic modelling of multi-agent systems.


We expect to attract high quality original papers that cover relevant
aspects of these topics. All submissions will be thoroughly evaluated.
On the basis of the referee reports, papers will be selected for
presentation at the conference and for the published post-conference 
proceedings.

	The multitopic omega-category of all multitopic omega-categories

			by M. Makkai (McGill University)

				September 2, 1999


Abstract

The paper gives two definitions: that of "multitopic omega-category" and
that of "the (large) multitopic set of all (small) multitopic
omega-categories". It also announces the theorem that the latter is a
multitopic omega-category. (The proof of the theorem will be contained in
a sequel to this paper.)

The work has two direct sources. One is the paper [H/M/P] (for the
references, see at the end of this abstract) in which, among others, the
concept of "multitopic set" was introduced. The other is the present
author's work on FOLDS, First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts. The
latter was reported on in [M2]. A detailed account of the work on FOLDS is
in [M3]. For the understanding of the present paper, what is contained in
[M2] suffices. In fact, section 1 of the present paper gives the
definitions of all that's needed in this paper; so, probably, there won't
be even a need to consult [M2]. 

The concept of multitopic set, the main contribution of [H/M/P], was, in
turn, inspired by the work of J. Baez and J. Dolan [B/D]. Multitopic sets
are a variant of opetopic sets of loc. cit. The name "multitopic set"
refers to multicategories, a concept originally due to J. Lambek [L], and
given an only moderately generalized formulation in [H/M/P]. The earlier
"opetopic set" of [B/D] is based on a concept of operad. I should say that
the exact relationship of the two concepts ("multitopic set" and "opetopic
set") is still not clarified. The main aspect in which the theory of
multitopic sets is in a more advanced state than that of opetopic sets is
that, in [H/M/P], there is an explicitly defined category Mlt of
*multitopes*, with the property that the category of multitopic sets is
equivalent to the category of Set-valued functors on Mlt, a result given a
detailed proof in [H/M/P]. The corresponding statement on opetopic sets
and opetopes is asserted in [B/D], but the category of opetopes is not
described. In this paper, the category of multitopes plays a basic role.

Multitopic sets and multitopes are described in section 2 of this paper;
for a complete treatment, the paper [H/M/P] should be consulted.

The indebtedness of the present work to the work of Baez and Dolan goes
further than that of [H/M/P]. The second ingredient of the Baez/Dolan
definition, after "opetopic set", is the concept of "universal cell". The
Baez/Dolan definition of weak n-category achieves the remarkable feat of
specifying the composition structure by universal properties taking place
in an opetopic set. In particular, a (weak) opetopic (higher-dimensional)
category is an opetopic set with additional properties ( but with no
additional data), the main one of the additional properties being the
existence of sufficiently many universal cells. This is closely analogous
to the way concepts like "elementary topos" are specified by universal
properties: in our situation, "multitopic set" plays the "role of the
base" played by "category" in the definition of "elementary topos". In
[H/M/P], no universal cells are defined, although it was mentioned that
their definition could be supplied without much difficulty by imitating
[B/D]. In this paper, the "universal (composition) structure" is supplied
by using the concept of FOLDS-equivalence of [M2].

In [M2], the concepts of "FOLDS-signature" and "FOLDS-equivalence" are
introduced. A (FOLDS-) signature is a category with certain special
properties. For a signature L , an *L-structure* is a Set-valued functor
on L. To each signature L, a particular relation between two variable
L-structures, called L-equivalence, is defined. Two L-structures M, N, are
L-equivalent iff there is a so-called L-equivalence span M<---P--->N
between them; here, the arrows are ordinary natural trasnformations,
required to satisfy a certain property called "fiberwise surjectivity".

The slogan of the work [M2], [M3] on FOLDS is that *all meaningful
properties of L-structures are invariant under L-equivalence*. As with all
slogans, it is both a normative statement ("you should not look at
properties of L-structures that are not invariant under L-equivalence"),
and a statement of fact, namely that the "interesting" properties of
L-structures are in fact invariant under L-equivalence. (For some slogans,
the "statement of fact" may be false.) The usual concepts of "equivalence"
in category theory, including the higher dimensional ones such as
"biequivalence", are special cases of L-equivalence, upon suitable, and
natural, choices of the signature L; [M3] works out several examples of
this. Thus, in these cases, the slogan above becomes a tenet widely held
true by category theorists. I claim its validity in the generality stated
above.

The main effort in [M3] goes into specifying a language, First Order Logic
with Dependent Sorts, and showing that the first order properties
invariant under L-equivalence are precisely the ones that can be defined
in FOLDS. In this paper, the language of FOLDS plays no role. The concepts
of "FOLDS-signature" and "FOLDS-equivalence" are fully described in
section 1 of this paper. 

The definition of *multitopic omega-category* goes, in outline, as
follows. For an arbitrary multitope SIGMA of dimension >=2, for a
multitopic set S, for a pasting diagram ALPHA in S of shape the domain of
SIGMA and a cell a in S of the shape the codomain of SIGMA, such that a
and ALPHA are parallel, we define what it means to say that a is a
*composite* of ALPHA. First, we define an auxiliary FOLDS signature
L<SIGMA> extending Mlt, the signature of multitopic sets. Next, we define
structures S<a> and S<ALPHA>, both of the signature L<SIGMA>, the first
constructed from the data S and a , the second from S and ALPHA, both
structures extending S itself. We say that a is a composite of ALPHA if
there is a FOLDS-equivalence-span E between S<a> and S<ALPHA> that
restricts to the identity equivalence-span from S to S . Below, I'll refer
to  E as an *equipment* for  a  being a composite of ALPHA. A multitopic
set is a *mulitopic omega-category* iff every pasting diagram  ALPHA in it
has at least one composite.

The analog of the universal arrows in the Baez/Dolan style definition is
as follows. A *universal arrow* is defined to be an arrow of the form
b:ALPHA-----> a where  a  is a composite of ALPHA via an equipment E that
relates b with the identity arrow on  a : in turn, the identity arrow on
a  is any composite of the empty pasting diagram of dimension  dim(a)+1
based on  a . Note that the main definition does *not* go through first
defining "universal arrow". 

A new feature in the present treatment is that it aims directly at weak
*omega*-categories; the finite dimensional ones are obtained as truncated
versions of the full concept. The treatment in [B/D] concerns finite
dimensional weak categories. It is important to emphasize that a
multitopic omega category is still just a multitopic set with additional
properties, but with no extra data.

The definition of "multitopic omega-category" is given is section 5; it
uses sections 1, 2 and 4, but not section 3.

The second main thing done in this paper is the definition of MltOmegaCat.
This is a particular large multitopic set. Its definition is completed
only by the end of the paper. The 0-cells of MltOmegaCat are the samll
multitopic omega-categories, defined in section 5. Its 1-cells, which we
call 1-transfors (thereby borrowing, and altering the meaning of, a term
used by Sjoerd Crans [Cr]) are what stand for "morphisms", or "functors",
of multitopic omega-categories. For instance, in the 2-dimensional case,
multitopic 2-categories correspond to ordinary bicategories by a certain
process of "cleavage", and the 1-transfors correspond to homomorphisms of
bicategories [Be]. There are n-dimensional transfors for each n in N . For
each multitope (that is, "shape" of a higher dimensional cell) PI, we
have the *PI-transfors*, the cells of shape PI in MltOmegaCat.

For each fixed multitope PI, a PI-transfor is a *PI-colored multitopic
set* with additional properties. "PI-colored multitopic sets" are defined
in section 3; when PI is the unique zero-dimensional multitope, PI-colored
multitopic sets are the same as ordinary multitopic sets. Thus, the
definition of a transfor of an arbitrary dimension and shape is a
generalization of that of "multitopic omega-category"; the additional
properties are also similar, they being defined by FOLDS-based universal
properties. There is one new element though. For dim(PI)>=2 , the concept
of PI-transfor involves a universal property which is an
omega-dimensional, FOLDS-style generalization of the concept of right
Kan-extension (right lifting in the terminology used by Ross Street).
This is a "right-adjoint" type universal property, in contrast to the
"left-adjoint" type involved in the concept of composite (which is a
generalization of the usual tensor product in modules). 

The main theorem, stated but not proved here, is that  MltOmegaCat is a
multitopic omega-category. 

The material in this paper has been applied to give formulations of
omega-dimensional versions of various concepts of homotopy theory;
details will appear elesewhere.

I thank Victor Harnik and Marek Zawadowski for many stimulating
discussions and helpful suggestions. I thank the members of the Montreal
Category Seminar for their interest in the subject of this paper, which
made the exposition of the material at a time when it was still in an
unfinished state a very enjoyable and useful process for me.

Objectives

Object-based Distributed Computing is being established as the most
pertinent basis for the support of large, heterogeneous computing and
telecommunications systems. Indeed, several important international
organisations, such as ITU, ISO, OMG, TINA-C, etc. are defining similar
distributed object-based frameworks as a foundation for open distributed
computing.

The advent of Open Object-based Distributed Systems - OODS - brings new
challenges and opportunities for the use and development of formal methods.
New architectures and system models are emerging (e.g., the enterprise,
information, computational and engineering viewpoints of the ITU-T/ISO/IEC
ODP Reference Model) which require formal notational support. Usual design
issues such as specification, verification, refinement, and testing need to
take into account new dimensions introduced by distribution and openness,
such as quality of service and dependability constraints, dynamic binding
and reconfiguration, consistency between multiple models and viewpoints,
etc. OODS is a challenging research context and a source of motivation for
semantical models of object-based systems and notations, for the evolution
of standardised formal description techniques, for the application and
assessment of logic based approaches, for better understanding and
information modeling of business requirements, and for the further
development and use of Object Oriented methodologies and tools.

The objective of FMOODS is to provide an integrated forum for the
presentation of research in several related fields, and the exchange of
ideas and experiences in the topics concerned with the formal methods
support for Open Object-based Distributed Systems.

Topics

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

   * formal models for object-based distributed computing
   * semantics of object-based distributed systems and programming languages
   * formal techniques in object-based and object-oriented specification,
     analysis and design
   * refinement and transformation of specifications
   * types, service types and subtyping
   * interoperability and composability of distributed services
   * object-based coordination languages
   * object-based mobile languages
   * efficient analysis techniques of specifications
   * multiple viewpoint modelling and consistency between different models
   * formal techniques in distributed systems verification and testing
   * specification, verification and testing of quality of service constraints
   * formal methods and object life cycle
   * beyond IDL: semantics based specification patterns
   * formal models for measuring the quality of object-oriented
     requirement or design specifications
   * formal aspects of distributed real-time multimedia systems
   * applications to telecommunications and related areas

In March 2000, an Abstract State Machine (ASM) Workshop (a follow up of
earlier workshops, see http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/asm/workshops) will be 
held in the conference center of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology 
at Monte Verita, Ticino, Switzerland, see http://www.csf-mv.ethz.ch .

The ASM formalism was proposed together with the thesis that it is suitable 
to model arbitrary algorithms on arbitrary abstraction levels. ASMs have 
been used to analyze and specify various hardware- and software-systems as 
well as computer languages, see http://www.eecs.umich.edu/gasm .

The aim of the workshop is to bring together domain-experts using ASMs as 
practical specification formalisms, and theoreticians using ASMs as formal 
starting point for their investigations. In addition the workshop is a 
forum on theoretical and practical topics that relate to ASMs in a broad 
sense.

The technical program will consist of invited lectures, tutorials, presenta-
tions of refereed papers, and software demonstrations. A significant part 
of the time will be devoted to discussions.

Invited talks will be given by 
  Andreas Blass      (Univ. of Michigan),

This is the second update on the paper "The multitopic omega-category of
all multitopic omega-categories". The zip-file that got onto both sites I
mentioned before was bad. I have now replaced it with another one which I
had tested for "unzipping". The two sites:

	ftp://ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/makkai

	http://mystic.biomed.mcgill.ca/M_Makkai

The filename is MLTOMCAT.ZIP. It is a ZIPped package of 8 POSTSCRIPT
files.

Would you let me know when the category has an equivalent skeleton? (The 
definition of the skeleton subcategory that I have in mind is from
MacLane p91: a full subcategory such that for any object in the original 
category, there exists a unique isomorphic object in the
skeleton subcategory.) My question is mainly about when I can use the
choice axiom without causing contradiction. For instance, I heard that the
category of abelian groups doesn't have an equivalent skeleton
subcategory.

Thank you very much,
Hongseok

"every small category has a skeleton"  iff  the axiom of choice holds.

See Exercise 3.26 in my book, or
	http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/book/html/s3e.html#e3.26
for a preorder example.

Exercise 4.37 defines "skeletal"

Please update all links and bookmarks to individual users's home pages
at McGill in the following way:
       http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~user (old style) 
becomes
       http://www.math.mcgill.ca/user (new style) 

(note the disappearance of the tilde).

(In particular, values of the variable "user" of interest to this list
include: barr, bunge, makkai, rags (or seely).  Lambek has a page at
http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/lambek , but at present this only
deals with a past LambekFest.)

At present, in addition, the Category Group home page on triples is
now http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples  -  but we are hoping to soon
have enabled the old version (through a virtual link) again.

As some of you may have been aware, we have had some security problems
at McGill, which is causing changes in our public "face".  We are
trying to keep these changes as "invisible" to the outside user as
possible.  You may (should) find that the old style urls still work,
but we cannot guarantee that that will continue, so changing your
links now will help.

		  !!! DEADLINE: OCTOBER 1, 1999 !!!
		  *********************************

			 Last Call for Papers

		     Third International Workshop

		  ``Frontiers of Combining Systems''
			     FroCoS'2000

		   March 22-24, 2000, Nancy, France

	     http://www.loria.fr/conferences/frocos2000/
	
       !!! DEADLINE FOR PAPER SUBMISSIONS: OCTOBER 1, 1999 !!!
       *******************************************************
				   
In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,
program development and proof, artificial intelligence, there is an
obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference mechanisms
for special tasks. In order to be usable in practice, these
specialized systems must be combined with each other, and they must be 
integrated into general purpose systems.  The development of general 
techniques for the combination and integration of special systems has
been initiated in many areas.

The two previous international workshops on ``Frontiers of Combining
Systems'' were held in Munich (1996) and in Amsterdam (1998). 
Like its predecessors, FroCoS'2000 is intended to offer a common
forum for research activities in the general area of combination and 
integration of systems, and on their practical use. 

Suggested, but not exclusive topics of interest for the workshop are: 

 * combination of logics 

 * combination of constraint solving techniques, of decision procedures,
   of term rewriting systems

 * combination of deduction systems and computer algebra

 * integration of decision procedures and other solving processes into
   constraint programming and deduction systems 

 * modelisation of hybrid systems 

 * logic modelling of multi-agent systems.


We expect to attract high quality original papers that cover relevant
aspects of these topics. All submissions will be thoroughly evaluated.
On the basis of the referee reports, papers will be selected for
presentation at the conference and for the published post-conference 
proceedings.

                             CADE-17

 The  17th  International  Conference  on  Automated  Deduction

                         June 17-20, 2000
                   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
               http://www.research.att.com/conf/cade/



                Preliminary CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS

                         June 16. and 21. 2000

CADE is the major forum for the presentation of new research in all aspects of
automated deduction. Proposals for workshops and for tutorials are solicited.
Tutorials will run June 16. and workshops also on June 21.  Workshops will
ordinarily run a whole day, and tutorials for half a day.

Workshop Topics
---------------

Recent CADE workshops have included term schematizations and their applications,
reasoning, automation of proofs by induction, empirical studies in logic
algorithms, mechanization of partial functions, proof search in type-theoretic
languages, automated model building, evaluation of automated theorem-proving
systems, strategies in automated deduction, automated theorem proving in software
engineering and in mathematics, integration of symbolic computation and
deduction. 
Workshops may have the same topic as those of previous workshops, and this
practice is encouraged.

Tutorial Topics
---------------

Recent CADE tutorials have included equality reasoning in semantic tableaux, proof
systems for nonmonotonic logics, rewrite techniques in theorem proving, proof
planning, parallelization of deduction strategies, resolution decision methods,
constructive type theory, the use of semantics in Herbrand-based proof procedures,
logical frameworks, theorem proving by the inverse method, deduction methods based
on boolean rings, higher-order equational logic, and term indexing in automated
reasoning.  
Tutorials may be introductory, intermediate, or advanced.


Proposals
---------

                          (ETAPS 2000)

Conference decsription:

FOSSACS seeks papers which offer progress in foundational research
with a clear significance for software science. A central issue is
theories and methods which support the specification, transformation,
verification, and analysis of programs and software systems.

Topics covered are:

**    Computational and syntactic foundations of software science:
      computation processes over discrete and continuous data,
      techniques for their manipulation, and their algorithmic, 
      algebraic, and logical properties;

**   Transition systems, models of concurrency and reactive systems,
      and corresponding calculi, algebras, and logics;

**   Type theory, domain theory, and their connections to semantics
      of programming languages and software specification.

EATCS/EAPLS BEST PAPER AWARDS

There will be two awards for the best paper among all the papers presented
at any of the five main ETAPS conferences: EATCS award and EAPLS
award.

The following preprint is available:

M. Grandis
Simplicial toposes and combinatorial homotopy,
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 400 (1999).


Abstract. The term *combinatorial topos* denotes here a topos of presheaves
over a small subcategory of the category of finite sets. The main instances
we want to consider are the presheaf categories of simplicial sets, cubical
sets, and globular sets, together with their symmetric versions: e.g., the
topos  !Smp  of symmetric simplicial sets consists of all presheaves on the
category  !Delta  of finite, positive cardinals.

     We show here how combinatorial homotopy, developed in previous works
for simplicial complexes (the cartesian closed subcategory of *simple*
presheaves in  !Smp)  can be extended to the topos  !Smp.  As a crucial
advantage, the (extended) fundamental groupoid  Pi_1: !Smp --> Gpd  is left
adjoint to a natural functor  M_1: Gpd --> !Smp,  the symmetric nerve of a
groupoid, and therefore - as a strong van Kampen property - preserves all
colimits.

     Analogously, a notion of (non-reversible) *directed* homotopy can be
developed in  Smp,  with applications to image analysis similar to the ones
of the symmetric case. We have now a homotopy n-category functor  C_n: Smp
--> n-Cat,  left adjoint to a nerve  N_n = n-Cat(C_n(Delta[n]), -).  It
would be interesting to determine whether the n-category  C_n(Delta[n])
coincides with Street's oriental  O_n,  and the previous nerve with
Street's, as it seems likely.
