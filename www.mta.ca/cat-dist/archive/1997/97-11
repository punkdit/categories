Surely a natural name for these "abelian-topos" categories would be
abelian-topos categories, AT categories for short.  (I barely grasp
them, I only found out what abelian categories were a week ago, when
someone on sci.math asked about them and I looked them up and answered
him because I wanted to know too.  It struck me as interesting that
they had so much in common with toposes, whence my question about
intersecting their respective theories.  I made language a parameter
because it seemed intuitively obvious that a strong enough language
would make the models of that intersection the union of the respective
classes.  But as Peter points out this is already a triviality for any
theory closed under classical disjunction, which I still can't believe
I didn't know.)

On the question of the right language for defining AT, I fully agree
with Peter that universal Horn sentences are the appropriate logical
strength of language.  (I take back what I said before about
"universal" not making a difference.  Peter showed that for the Horn
theory, i.e. allowing existential quantification, the models are
representable as products AxT of an abelian category A with a pretopos
T.  Presumably the weaker universal Horn theory admits in addition the
appropriate subcategories thereof.)  So would it be correct to say that
this makes AT a quasivariety in CAT with functors preserving the
signature Peter is using?

What I'm less clear about than the logical strength is the choice of
signature.  In particular what about the closed structure?

Without the closed structure we have Peter's AxT representation
theorem, with the theory finitely axiomatized to boot.  Presumably this
remains unchanged by the introduction of closed structure: we retain
only those categories AxT such that A and T independently admit closed
structure, and can finitely axiomatize the separate closed structure of
each in terms of the associated retractions A and T (ugh, overloading),
thereby axiomatizing the joint closed structure.

For example the tensor unit I of AxT will be (Z,1) (Z the tensor unit
of A), with AI = (Z,0) != I (except for pure abelian categories) and TI
= (0,1) = 1 != I (except for pure pretoposes).  But for objects a,b of
A and t,u of T, the tensor product (a,t)@(b,u) will be (a@b,txu), with
A(a@b,txu) = (a@b,0) = (a,0)@(b,0) = A(a,t)@A(b,u) and T(a@b,txu) =
(0,txu) = (0,t)@(0,u) = T(a,t)@T(b,u).  (So the retractions preserve
tensor product but not tensor unit---TI just gives the terminator, but
AI furnishes a new constant.)

So should there perhaps be two classes, the AT categories and the
closed AT categories?  The latter would add I and @ to the signature
(and presumably \aleph\lambda\rho, bless them).

For the closed AT categories, TX can be neatly defined as 1@X, with the
T-type objects identified as those having only one map to I (Mike Barr
pointed out to me that strictness of 0, maps to 0 only from initial
objects, would do this job), and with a topos defined as a closed AT
category for which I is terminal (or 0 is strict).

But although people seem comfortable working with toposes as opposed to
pretoposes, what about abelian closed categories (if that's the right
word order)?  Despite Ab itself being a closed category, I don't see
much discussion of closed structure for abelian categories.  Why is
this?  Am I just reading the wrong stuff, or is the closed structure of
abelian categories boring, or what?  Or is FinAb (abelian but not
abelian closed---no suitable tensor unit) too desirable to discard in
this way?  (What comparably interesting pretoposes are so lost?  Not
the topos FinSet.)  Does the requirement of being closed kill off too
many desirable abelian categories?  I would have thought lack of closed
structure would greatly impair the utility of a category, however
beautiful its objects might be.

I'm interested in these classes, especially those whose categories
admit closed structure, because toposes sit at or near the left
(geometric or discrete) end of what I've been calling the Stone gamut,
while abelian categories sit near the middle.  AT categories offer an
entirely different approach to the Chu construction for mixing
categories from strategic positions on the Stone gamut.  The Chu
construction Chu(V,k) mixes two closed categories, V and V\op,
symmetrically positioned about the center of the Stone gamut, to yield
all categories "in between" V and V\op (and "all"--certainly all
small--categories period when V and V\op are at the outermost points,
viz. Set and Set\op).  In contrast AT categories mix categories from
the far left (represented by Set) and the center (represented by Ab) to
get a qualitatively different effect that I'm not sure how to relate to
the Chu construction but which seems in some vague sense dual to it.

One such sense is as follows.  AT is the quasivariety generated just by
Set and Ab alone.  So in this sense at least it is the smallest
quasivariety spanning the left half of the Stone gamut, assuming that
the quasivariety generated by either Set or Ab alone does not span the
gamut but crowds around their two respective positions on the gamut,
left and middle.  Include the duals of AT categories (not necessarily
expanded to a quasivariety, see below) and now you cover the whole
gamut in this minimal sense.  On the other hand the various
comprehensiveness properties I've been pointing out for the concrete
subcategories of Chu(Set,K) for large enough K (including all small
categories, even when concreteness is a requirement unlike the
comprehensiveness results of the 1960's) make "sub-Chu" maximal over
the Stone gamut.

Vague question.  The minimality of AT and the maximality of Chu is a
very weak sort of duality, analogous to the minimal structure of sets
vs. the maximal structure of Boolean algebras.  Is there a more formal
duality here, analogous to the duality of Set and CABA?  That the
retracts AX and TX seem to be dual notions, being respectively
coreflective and reflective, gives them some of the flavor of Chu.  But
is AT itself dual to Chu in any categorical sense?

More precise question.  Is the quasivariety generated by all three of
Set, Ab, and Set\op (aka CABA) finitely axiomatizable?  And if not,
does using Bool instead of CABA help or hinder?

I'd like to know whether the following simple observation is well known.
If F -| U : E -> S is a local map of toposes i.e. Gamma : Gl(F) -> Gl(Id_S)
has a fibred right adjoint Nabla then U is full and faithful, i.e. one has
the situation of a Unity and Identity of Adjoint Opposites in Lawvere's sense.
Of course, UIAO entails that the geom. morph. is local.
For the reverse direction the argument is as follows. If Gamma has a fibred
right adjoint Nabla then Gamma preserves sums, i.e. is a cocartesian functor.
Let

         FI ============ FI
         ||              |
         ||              | Ff    be a cocartesian arrow in  E / F
         ||              V
         FI -----------> FJ
                Ff

then its image under Gamma is the left square in the diagram below

                i            q
          I ----------> P ------>UFI
         ||             |         |
         ||             | p  pbk  | UFf     with q o i = eta_I
         ||             V         V
          I ----------> J ------>UFJ
                f          eta_J

where i is an isomorphism as Gamma is cocartesian. That means 

         eta_I
      I -------> UFI
      |          |
      |          | UFf    is a pullback for all f : I -> J
      V          V
      J -------> UFJ
         eta_J

Choosing J = 1 we get that  eta_I  is an iso, i.e. eta is a natural iso.
Thus, F and the right adjoint of U are both full and faithful.

Of course, this argument doesn't go through when "local" is defined as U 
having an ordinary right adjoint.

Open House for a Workshop on

Global actions, groups and homotopy. 

Professor A Bak and two colleagues will be visiting Bangor under an ARC 
Scheme Dec 15-20, 1997, and a workshop will be held on the interactions 
of the above themes.
 
Global actions: The algebraic counterpart of a topological space. 

Bak's theory introduces an algebraic concept of space with motion, which 
arose from K-theory considerations.  A global action consists of a set X 
and a collection of groups acting on subsets of X. It yields a homotopy 
theory for algebraic structures which includes a natural, intuitive as 
well as rigorous concept of algebraic deformation of morphism.  
The aim of the workshop is to introduce these ideas and to relate them to 
methods of special interest at Bangor, for example algebraic models of 
homotopy types, homotopy coherence, higher dimensional algebra, 
computational aspects. 

All those interested are welcome, but no financial support is available.  
Information on accommodation in Bangor is available from the web site and 
participants are asked to make their own arrangements, although we will 
help if we can. 

Further information will be posted on

I've had trouble with starting a reply to Vaughan's most recent
posting, the one headed, "Abelian-topos (AT) categories". It makes the
wide gap that's come into being all too painful.

Vaughan wrote,

  I don't see much discussion of closed structure for abelian
  categories.  Why is this?  Am I just reading the wrong stuff, or is
  the closed structure of abelian categories boring, or what?

And that was after he had written,

 I only found out what abelian categories were a week ago.

For a long time Category Theory existed (say, in the Mathematical
Reviews) as a subset of Homological Algebra -- which is a way of
saying that category theory was abelian category theory. (I can't
remember a new result in the theory of abelian categories in the last
quarter-century. I do remember, alas, a bunch of new announcements of
such results.)

I have trouble with Vaughan's phrase "the closed structure" on an
abelian category. There can be many. The category of finite-
dimensional complex representations of a compact group has a
distinguished symmetric monoidal closed structure. If they are viewed
just as categories then for any two compact groups with the same
number of conjugacy classes the categories are isomorphic. If viewed
just as monoidal closed categories then the necessary and sufficient
condition that they be isomorphic is that the groups have isomorphic
character tables. On the other hand, if viewed as a _symmetric_
monoidal closed categories, one can recover the group from the
category. If you want a specific example consider the two non-abelian
groups of order eight, the dihedral and the quaternian. In each case
the plain category of representations is the 5-fold cartesian power of
the category of finite-dimensional complex vector spaces. As monoidal
closed categories they are isomorphic (but not isomorphic with the
5-fold cartesian power of the closed monoidal category of finite-
dimensional complex vector spaces). As symmetric monoidal closed
categories they are different.

Anyway, there's a whole body of material. A lot of it is now viewed as
standard in a number of (non-categorical) subjects and as for all
successfull branches of category theory the theory of abelian
categories is no longer considered to be a branch of category theory.

Back to pratt cats: if one wants to axiomatize those categories that
are products of abelian cats and topoi and not worry about the
intervening families the axioms can be made quite simple. After
saying that it's a regular category with a coterminator contained in
its terminator, I'd start with the  P-E-l-r-/\  structure as in my 
last post, define  TX  as the image of  rX  and prove it to be the
correflection of X into the full subcategory of type-T objects. 
0xX -> X  is easily seen to be the correflection of  X  into the full
subcategory of type-A objects. Then the axiom that these two 
correflections yield a coproduct decomposition for each object allows
one to prove quickly that the category is the cartesian product of the
two correfletive subcategories. The type-T objects clearly form a
topos. All that's needed now is a couple of axioms to make the type-A 
objects abelian.

I appreciate that there are people on the list with more years of
experience with abelian categories than I have days.  AC's don't seem
to have penetrated much into computer science, and I have no idea
whether they need to.

But the finite axiomatizability of the quasivariety generated by Set
and Ab definitely has my attention.  And the fact that toposes and
abelian categories, so far apart intuitively (sets vs. abelian
groups?), are brought to within so short an axiom of each other by the
definition of AT cats, has the potential to make abelian categories
much more relevant to fans of toposes.

Peter (and privately Fred Linton and Mike Barr) have answered my
question about what I was naively calling "abelian closed".  "Abelian"
and "cartesian" are not interchangeable adjectives inasmuch as the
latter describes the tensor product in the context of "cartesian
closed" while the former names a quasivariety.  While I was aware of
the distinction, I was hoping that abelian categories as the models of
the universal Horn theory of Ab, combined with Ab having closed
structure, would somehow make the juxtaposition "abelian closed"
meaningful, but the examples show this to be wishful thinking.  And
Peter's

	define  TX  as the image of  rX

removes any motivation to define TX as 1@X.  (Meanwhile I've reconciled
myself to TX as the pushout of the projections of 0xX.)

Not just finitely axiomatizable but beautifully so.

Yes, there is a simple proof of this fact in Proposition 1.4 of "Local
maps of toposes" by Johnstone & Moerdijk (Proc. London Math. Soc. (3)
58 (1989), 281--305).

Just a thought about Vaughan's original question: the class of toposes
(and that of pretoposes) is stable under slicing, as are all the
`exactness properties' that they share with abelian categories. Slices
of abelian categories aren't abelian; but, thanks to Aurelio Carboni, 
we know how to characterize them. So we ought surely to be looking for
a common generalization, not of toposes and abelian categories, but of
(pre)toposes and affine categories in Aurelio's sense.

How about it, Peter?

                        LOGICAL ABSTRACT MACHINES 
                           August 17 - 21, 1998

                       A workshop held as part of the 
        10th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information 
                               (ESSLLI-98) 
                August 17 - 28, 1998, Saarbrueken, Germany

                        ** FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS **

ORGANISERS: Valeria de Paiva and Eike Ritter (University of Birmingham)

Web site: http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~esslli98/workshops.html

BACKGROUND:
This workshop brings together recent work on the design of abstract 
machines for functional programming languages based on logical foundations.  
Abstract machines describe implementations of functional languages on a 
level of abstraction which is high enough to make it possible to reason 
about the implementation but low enough as to allow an easy coding of the 
abstract machine.  The workshop is aimed at students and researchers with a 
basic understanding of functional programming and intuitionistic logic who 
want to work on the exciting field of programming with a solid logical 
basis.

We focus the workshop along two main themes: explicit substitutions and 
abstract machines based on Linear Logic.  Most of the more recent work on 
abstract machines is directed towards implementing and proving correct 
functional languages based on Linear Logic ideas.  Linear Logic, being a 
resource logic, was deemed ideal to model resource control in functional 
languages.

FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP:
The workshop consists of five sessions of 90 minutes and time will be 
allocated according to the quality of the submissions.  We seek original 
papers on the full spectrum of abstract machines from theory to 
application.  Among the topics of interest are:

  Theory                                Design and Implementation
  ------                                -------------------------
  formal semantics                      description of working systems
  explicit substitution  calculi        combinators
  type theory                           graph reduction techniques
  linear decorations                    run-time/memory management
  game theory for linear logic          applications
                
SUBMISSIONS:
All researchers in the area, but especially Ph.D.  students and young 
researchers, are encouraged to submit an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) 
and preferably in postscript A4 format by

          **February 15, 1998**

In that context let me rephrase my question about adding in Set\op as,
is the common universal Horn theory of Set, Ab, and Set\op, along with
their slices, finitely axiomatizable?  Or (with or without the slices)
is this nice link between Set and Ab confined to the geometric
(discrete) half of mathematics?

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Analytic Categories

Consider a category with an initial object 0. Two maps u: U -
-> X and v: V --> X are "disjoint" if 0 is the pullback of (u,
v). Suppose X + Y is the sum of two objects with the
injections (also called "direct monos") x: X --> X + Y and y:
Y --> X + Y. Then X + Y is  "disjoint" if the injections x and
y are disjoint and monic. The sum X + Y is "stable" if for any
map f: Z --> X + Y, the pullbacks Z_X --> Z and Z_Y --> Z
of x and y along f exist, and the induced map Z_X + Z_Y -->
Z is an isomorphism. 

Assume the category has pullbacks. A "strong mono" is a
map (in fact, a mono) such that any of its pullbacks is not
proper (i.e. non-isomorphic) epic. The category is "perfect" if
any intersection of strong monos exist. If a map f is the
composite m.e of an epi e followed by a strong mono m then
the pair (e, m) is called an "epi-strong-mono factorization" of
f; the codomain of e is called the "strong image" of f. In a
perfect category any map has an epi-strong-mono
factorization.

An "analytic category" is a category satisfying the following
axioms:
(Axiom 1) Finite limits and finite sums exist.
(Axiom 2) Finite sums are disjoint and stable.
(Axiom 3) Any map has an epi-strong-mono factorization.

Consider an analytic category. For any object X denote by
R(X) the set of strong subobjects of X. Since finite limits
exist, the poset R(X) has meets. Suppose u: U  -->  X and v:
V  -->  X are two strong subobjects. Suppose T = U + V is
the sum of U and V and t: T  -->  X is the map induced by u
and v. Then the strong image t(T) of T in X is the join of U
and V in R(X). It follows that R(X) has joins. Thus R(X) is a
lattice, with 0_X: 0  -->  X as zero and 1_X: X  -->  X as
one. If the category is prefect then R(X) is a complete lattice.
An object Z has exactly one strong subobject (i.e. 0_Z = 1_Z)
iff it is initial. 

If u: U --> X is a mono, we denote by f^{-1}(u) the pullback
of u along f. Then f^{-1}: R(X) --> R(Y) is a mapping
preserving meets with f^{-1}(0_X) = 0_Y and f^{-1}(1_X) =
1_Y (i.e. f^{-1} is bounded). Also f^{-1} has a left adjoint
f^{+1}: R(Y) --> R(X) sending each strong subobject v: V --
>  Y to the strong image of the composite f. v: V --> X. If V
= Y then f^{+1}(Y) is simply the strong image of f.

The theories of analytic categories and Zariski geometries
(including the notions of coflat maps and analytic monos)
given below are based on the works of Diers (see [D] and
[D1]). Note that we have only covered the most elementary
part of the theory of Zariski geometries (up to the first three
chapters of [D]). 

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Distributive Properties

Let C be an analytic category. Recall that a "regular mono" is
a map which can be written as the equalizer of some pair of
maps.

(2.1) The class of strong monos is closed under composition
and stable under pullback; any intersection of strong monos is
a strong mono.

(2.2) An epi-strong-mono factorization of a map is unique up
to isomorphism.

(2.3)  Any regular mono is a strong mono; any pullback of a
regular mono is a regular mono; any direct mono is a regular
mono; finite sums commute with equalizers.

(2.4) Any proper (i.e. non-isomorphic) strong subobject is
contained in a proper regular subobject; a map is not epic iff
it factors through a proper regular (or strong) mono. 

(2.5) The initial object 0 is strict (i.e. any map X --> 0 is an
isomorphism); any map 0 --> X is regular (thus is not epic
unless X is initial).

(2.6) If the terminal object 1 is strict (i.e. any map 1 --> X is
an isomorphism) then the category is equivalent to the
terminal category 1 (thus the opposite of an analytic category
is not analytic unless it is a terminal category).

(2.7)  Let f_1: Y_1 --> X_1 and f_2: Y_2 --> X_2 be two
maps. Then f_1 + f_2 is epic (resp. monic, resp. regular
monic) iff f_1 and f_2 are so.

---------------------------------------------------------------
3. Coflat Maps

A map f: Y  -->  X is "coflat" if the pullback functor C/X  --> 
C/Y along f preserves epis. More generally a map f: Y  -->  X
is called "precoflat" if the pullback of any epi to X along f is
epic. A map is coflat iff it is "stable precoflat" (i.e. any of its
pullback is precoflat). An analytic category is "coflat" if any
map is coflat (or equivalently, any epi is stable).

(3.1) Coflat maps (or monos) are closed under composition
and stable under pullback; isomorphisms are coflat; any direct
mono is coflat.	

(3.2) Finite products of coflat maps are coflat; a finite sum of
maps is coflat iff each factor is coflat.

(3.4) Suppose f: Y --> X is a mono and g: Z --> Y is a map.
Then g is coflat if f.g is coflat.

(3.5) For any object X, the codiagonal map X + X --> X is
coflat.

(3.6) Suppose {f_i: Y_i --> X} is a finite family of coflat
maps. Then f = \sum (f_i): Y = \sum Y_i --> X is coflat.

(3.7) Suppose f: Y --> X is a coflat bimorphisms. If g: Z -->
Y is a map such that f.g is an epi, then g is an epi.

(3.8) Suppose f: Y --> X is a coflat mono (bimorphisms) and
g: Z --> Y is any map. Then g is a coflat mono (bimorphisms)
iff f.g is a coflat mono (bimorphisms).  

(3.9) If x: X_1 --> X is a map which is disjoint with a coflat
map f: Y --> X, then the strong image of x is disjoint with f.  

(3.10) If f: Y --> X is a coflat map, then f^{-1}: R(X) -->
R(Y) is a morphism of lattice.

(3.11) If f: Y --> X is a coflat mono, then f^{-1}f^{+1} is the
identity R(Y) --> R(Y).

(3.12) (Beck-Chevalley condition) Suppose f: Y --> X is a
coflat map and g: S --> X is a map. Let (p: T --> Y, n: T -->
S) be the pullback of (f, g). Then p^{+1}n^{-1} = f^{-
1}g^{+1}. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Analytic Monos

A mono u^c: U^c --> X is a "complement" of a mono u: U --
> X if u and u^c are disjoint, and any map v: T --> X such
that u and v are disjoint factors through u^c (uniquely). The
complement u^c of u, if exists, is uniquely determined up to
isomorphism. A mono is "singular" if it is the complement of
a strong mono. An "analytic mono" is a coflat singular mono.
A mono is "disjunctable" if it has a coflat complement. An
analytic category is "disjunctable" if any strong mono is
disjunctable; it is "locally disjunctable" if any strong mono is
an intersection of disjunctable strong monos.

(4.1) Analytic monos are closed under composition and stable
under pullbacks;  isomorphisms are analytic monos; a mono is
analytic iff it is a coflat complement of a mono; any direct
mono is analytic.

(4.2) The pullback of any disjunctable mono is disjunctable.

(4.3) If u: U --> X and v: V --> X are two disjunctable strong
subobjects of X, then u^c \cap v^c = (u \vee v)^c.

(4.4) Finite intersections and finite sums of analytic monos
are analytic monos.

(4.5) Suppose any strong map is regular. Then C is
disjunctable iff any object is disjunctable. It is locally
disjunctable if there is a set of cogenerators consisting of
disjunctable objects.

------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Reduced Objects

A map is "unipotent" if any of its pullback is not proper
initial. A map (in fact, a mono) is "normal" if any of its
pullback is not proper unipotent. A "reduced object" is an
object such that any unipotent map to it is epic. A unipotent
reduced strong subobject of an object X is called  the
"radical" of X, denoted by rad(X). A "reduced model" of an
object X is the largest reduced strong subobject of X,
denoted by red(X). An analytic category is "reduced" if any
object is reduced. An analytic category is "reducible" if any
non-initial object has a non-initial reduced strong subobject. If
f: Y --> X is an epi we simply say that X is a "quotient" of Y.
A "locally direct mono" is a mono which is an intersection of
direct monos. An analytic category  is "decidable" (resp.
"locally decidable") if any strong mono is a direct (resp.
locally direct) mono.

(5.1) An object is reduced iff any unipotent strong mono to it
is an isomorphism (i.e. any object has no proper unipotent
strong subobject).

(5.2) Any stable epi is unipotent; conversely any unipotent
map in a reduced analytic category is a stable epi.

(5.3) A unipotent strong subobject contains each reduced
subobject.

(5.4) A radical is the largest reduced and the smallest
unipotent strong subobject (therefore is unique).

(5.5) Any quotient of a reduced object is reduced; if f: Y -->
X is a map and U is a reduced strong subobject of Y then its
strong image f^{+1}(U) in X is reduced.

(5.6) Any reduced subobject is contained in a reduced strong
subobject.

(5.7) The join of a set of reduced strong subobjects of an
object (in the lattice of strong subobjects) is reduced.

(5.8) Any analytic subobject of a reduced object is reduced.

(5.9) An analytic category is reduced iff every strong mono is
normal. 

(5.10) Any object in a perfect analytic category has a reduced
model.

(5.11) If X has a reduced model red(X) then any map from a
reduced object to X factors uniquely through the mono r(X) 
-->  X.

(5.12) In a perfect analytic category the full subcategory of
reduced subobjects is a coreflective subcategory. 

(5.13) The radical of an object X is the reduced model of X.

(5.14) In a reducible analytic category the reduced model of
an object is unipotent (thus is the radical); any object in a
perfect reducible analytic category has a radical.

(5.15) Any decidable or locally decidable analytic category is
reduced.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6. Integral Objects

A non-initial reduced object is "integral" if any non-initial
coflat map to it is epic. An integral strong subobject of an
object X is called a "prime" of X. Denote by Spec(X) the set
of primes of X. An analytic category is "spatial" if any non-
initial object has a non-initial prime.

(6.1) Any quotient of an integral object is integral; if f: Y -->
X is a map and U a prime of Y, then f^{+1}(U) is a prime of
X.    

(6.2) If U and V are two non-initial coflat (resp. analytic)
subobjects of an integral object, then the intersection of U
and V is non-initial.

(6.3) Any non-initial analytic subobject of an integral object is
integral.

(6.4) In a locally disjunctable analytic category the following
are equivalent for a non-initial reduced object X: (a) X is
integral;  (b) Any non-initial analytic mono is epic; (c) X is
not the join of two proper strong subobjects in R(X).

Under one view, there is a mismatch in the comparison between toposes and
Abelian categories. Consider enriched category theory over Set and Ab[elian
groups].

Over Set: enriched category A = small category, A-action = functor from A
to Set (covariant or contra- for right or left action), cat of A-actions =
Set^A or Set^A^op, wlog a presheaf topos, "quotient" (by Grothendieck
topology) = general Grothendieck topos.

Over Ab: enriched category A = ringoid ("ring with several objects"),
A-action = right or left module over A, cat of A-actions = Mod-A or A-Mod,
"quotient" (by Gabriel topology, a.k.a. hereditary torsion theory) =
Grothendieck category, i.e. cocomplete Abelian category in which direct
limits are exact and there is a generator.

By the Lubkin-Heron-Freyd-Mitchell theorems, Abelian categories embed fully
faithfully in Grothendieck categories but are more general. Assuming this
parallel Grothendieck toposes || Grothendieck categories is a good one, is
there a natural parallel of Abelian categories on the Set-enriched side?

In reply to Steve Vickers' post, I have a few comments.  First off,
it was not Lubkin-Heron-Freyd-Mitchell who proved the full embedding
theorem.  The first three proved only a faithful functor into set
(and subject to some smallness condition), while Mitchell showed
the full embedding theorem.  And not merely into a Grothendieck abelian
category, but one with a small projective generator.  The analogue would
be an embedding into a set-valued functor category.  Unfortunately,
a beautiful observation of Makkai's shows that that is impossible.  
Makkai pointed out that under a full embedding that preserves finite
limits, finite sums and epis the boolean algebra of complemented
subobjects, which is classified by maps into 1 + 1, would have to
be preserved.  But in a functor category that lattice is complete
and atomic (that is, completely distributive), so that fact, which
is not true for toposes in general, becomes a necessary condition
for the existence of an embedding.  (Is it sufficient?)  There is, of
course, a full embedding theorem for small exact categories, but that
is a lot less than a topos.  But is true that additive + exact = abelian,
so maybe that is also a good analogy.

The result that Steve Vickers cited -- that every small abelian
cateogory can be fully embedded into a Grothendieck category --
actually must have come before anything proved by Lubkin, Heron, Freyd
or Mitchell. I'm sure that Grothendieck knew about the canonical
representation of a small abelian category into its category of
abelian pre-canonical sheaves.

>From 3 to 5 November, I attended a meeting of ASE97 (Automated Software
Engineering) at Lake Tahoe Nevada; this is a major conference in the software
engineering community, attended this year by about 400 people.  The interest
in category theory at this meeting really amazed me; I dont think such a thing
could have happened even two years ago.  Two tutorials (out of 6) were
actually based on category theory, and both were sold out; 3 papers out of 32
heavily used category theory, and 3 more used tools or methods that involve
category theory.

The most surprising and hopeful event was a panel on the role of category
theory in software engineering on Tuesday morning (4 Nov), organized and
moderated by Mike Lowry (NASA), cochair of the conference program committee;
the panel was very well attended (maybe 200 people) and was very positive.
The panelists were Capt. Mark Gerken (USAF), myself (UCSD), Richard Jullig
(ArrowLogics, a small categorical startup), and Doug Smith (Kestrel); we also
tried to get Mike Healey (Boeing), but he didnt attend the conference.

Lowry introduced the panelists and the questions they were asked to address.
He then sketched the early history of category theory and some basic
definitions.

Gerken outlined a substantial research program, much of which involved
applying a large and successful system called SpecWare from Kestrel; several
applications involved generating code for complex scheduling algorithms from
their (algebraic) specifications.  Colimits are the main bit of category
theory in SpecWare, along the lines pioneered by my work on categorical
general system theory in the late 60s, and the languages Clear and OBJ that I
helped develop.  Gerken considers software architecture and reuse very
promising areas for future research.

Goguen described several past applications, noting how they used category
theory in different ways, e.g., for generality (in general systems theory and
institution-based specification languages), for deeper conceptual
understanding (axioms for categories of fuzzy sets), and to state results more
sharply (abstract data types as initial algebras, and minimal realizations as
adjoints).  He also described how initiality and colimits entered computer
science (the former via Lawvere's axiom of infinity).  Goguen suggested sheaf
theory and enriched categories as promising future areas, the first especially
for concurrency and the second for semiotics.

Jullig described some principles behind SpecWare and the new system that his
company is building, saying why colimit based systems were superior to more
traditional language mechanisms, like those found in Z, ML, etc.  He also
suggested fibrations and categorical logic as promising future topics.

Smith went deeper into principles of SpecWare, emphasizing the role of theory
morphisms, e.g., in supporting structured specifications, refinement and
parameterized specifications, all of which are useful for algorithm design and
code generation, among other things.  Smith also noted the role of the theory
of institutions for avoiding commitment to any particular logic, and described
several applications done with SpecWare; he was particularly happy with a
classification scheme for algorithms.

Members of the audience then initited a robust discussion of educational
issues, for example, how category theory could be learned by software
engineers, whether it is too hard or could be considered fun, what alternative
formalisms exist, what to read, etc.

Of course, as a participant I was at a disadvantage in taking notes, and there
are no doubt many inaccuracies of ascription and omission in the above, but I
still hope it may convey the flavor of the event.

                                                   International PhD School
                                                   in Computer Science
                                                   University of Aarhus

Call for Admission and Grant Applications

This is a call for admission and  grant applications from students to BRICS
International PhD   School in Computer  Science   at University  of Aarhus,
Denmark.  The  call  is  aimed   at students  starting  August  1998,  with
application deadline January 1st, 1998.

BRICS  International PhD School is an  integrated part  of the BRICS (Basic
Research in Computer Science) Research  Centre, and both  are funded by the
Danish National Research  Foundation. The   school admits 10-15    students
(Danish and   foreign) annually, and  it provides   a substantial number of
student grants.

The core areas of  the PhD School  are: Semantics of Computation; Logic  in
Computer   Science;  Computational   Complexity;  Design  and  Analysis  of
Algorithms; Programming Languages; Distributed Computing; Verification; and
Data Security and Cryptology.

The PhD school will  provide its students with  a  solid background in  the
theoretical  foundation   centred around   BRICS activities.     From  this
foundation, the  students may either  continue in one of  the core areas or
venture into  areas of a  more applied or  experimental  nature as possible
areas of thesis specialisation.

The PhD School wishes to recruit PhD students of the highest international
standards. It provides an excellent research environment and scientific
training facilities, and aims at making its PhD graduates attractive for a
wide spectrum of employers - in private and public research and development
institutions, both in Denmark and abroad.

So, if you are a student with at least four years of full-time study by the
summer of 1998,   highly motivated and well   prepared for a   PhD study in
computer  science within a  truly international environment, please send us
an application  following the instructions below.  For more details, please
visit
                           http://www.brics.dk,

or contact us by e-mail at phdschool@brics.dk.

Also,  we would appreciate your  passing on this  information to interested
students and colleagues at your university or research institute.


BRICS

The Research Centre BRICS (Basic  Research In Computer Science) was founded
in 1994  by the Danish National Research  Foundation at the Universities of
Aarhus and Aalborg.  BRICS is a centre of  basic research  in Algorithmics,
Logic and Semantics, and has a  scientific staff of  30 (permanent and long
term visitors), and around 100 short term visitors annually.


Admission Prerequisites and Study Structure

Admission is based  on knowledge corresponding  to four years of  full-time
studies, including basic courses in  programming and programming languages,
computer   systems, algorithms    and data  structures,  computability  and
mathematics (this list will be interpreted in a flexible way)

The time allocated for the  PhD studies is a  further four years, where the
first  two  years  include some   mandatory course  work   and introductory
research, concluded by a qualifying examination, whereas the last two years
are dedicated to  the writing of the  thesis, finishing with a defence. All
students admitted to the  school will enter  this study structure. We  may,
however, take into account merits from previous study.

Students  are normally admitted   for the semester  start  September 1st, -
however, we advocate arrival to  Aarhus from August  1st so that there will
be ample time  for the students to settle  in and get  used to the city and
the university environment -  but admission may  take place throughout  the
year.


PhD Student Grants

The school offers student grants of different types:

1. tuition waiver and full studentship
2. tuition waiver and partial studentship
3. tuition waiver

Only a limited amount of type 1. grants are available.


How to apply

1. Fill in the application form on

      http://www.brics.dk/PhDSchool/Application.html

Mike Barr on the question: "is every small topos fully representable
into a set-valued functor category?":

  Unfortunately, a beautiful observation of Makkai's shows that that
  is impossible. Makkai pointed out that under a full embedding that
  preserves finite limits, finite sums and epis the boolean algebra of
  complemented subobjects, which is classified by maps into 1 + 1,
  would have to be preserved. But in a functor category that lattice
  is complete and atomic (that is, completely distributive), so that
  fact, which is not true for toposes in general, becomes a necessary
  condition for the existence of an embedding.  (Is it sufficient?)

One can go further. The embedding will necessarily preserve all finite
colimits and all infinite coproducts that happen to exist. 

Extend the Makkai observation as follows. For any pair of objects  A
and  B  note that the lattice of partial maps with complemented 
domains can be constructed as the set of maps from  A  to  1+B  (give
1+B  the "flat ordering" of CS: start with  B  with the trivial 
partial ordering and adjoin a bottom). The fact that it's a complete
lattice is enough to show that arbitrary disjoint unions are 
coproducts. 

There is an argument for the case that the topos does not have a 
natural numbers object but I'll assume here that it does have such.
The standard points of the natural numbers object are complemented,
hence their union must exist; that union is a coproduct; it must
therefore be the entire natural numbers object. It is preserved by
the embedding.

In Aspects of Topoi there's a lemma entitled "one coequalizer for
all" that now suffices to show that the representation preserves
all coequalizers.

Differential Forms as Infinitesimal Cochains

This is essentially my contribution at the Vancvouver Category Theory
Meeting in July. It proves that the simplicial complex given by the first
neighbourhood of the diagonal of a manifold (in a well adapted model for
SDG) has de Rham cohomology of the manifold as its R-dual.


Extension Theory for Local Groupoids

We relate Extension Theory for (non-abelian) groups (a la Eilenberg-Mac
Lane) with the theory of Connections (a la Ehresmann), via a notion of
local groupoid. In particular, we give in this setting a kind of converse
to the statement "the curvature 2-form of a connection satisfies Bianchi
identity".

Limits in double categories
by Marco Grandis and Robert Pare

Abstract. We define the notion of (horizontal) double limit for a double
functor  F: I -> A  between double categories, and we give a construction
theorem for such limits, from double products, double equalisers and
tabulators (the double limits of vertical arrows). Double limits can
describe important tools; for instance, the Grothendieck construction of a
profunctor is its tabulator, in the "double category" of categories,
functors and profunctors. If  A  is a 2-category, the previous result
reduces to Street's construction theorem of weighted limits, by ordinary
limits and cotensors  2*X  (the tabulator of the vertical identity of the
object  X).

                        CALL FOR PAPERS


The general theme of this series of conferences is the use of crisp,
clear mathematics in the discovery and design of algorithms and in the
development of corresponding software or hardware. The conference
theme reflects the growing interest in formal, mathematically based
methods for the construction of software and hardware. The goal of the
MPC conferences is to report on and significantly advance the state of
the art in this area. Previous conferences were held in 1989 at
Twente, The Netherlands, organised by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, in
1992 at Oxford, United Kingdom, and in 1995 at Kloster Irsee, Germany,
organised by Augsburg University.


                          SUBMISSION
=20
Full papers should be submitted in Postscript format by e-mail to
reach Johan Jeuring by December 15, 1997. The details of the
submission procedure can be found at

  http://www.md.chalmers.se/Conf/MPC98/how_to_submit.html=20

Although there is no page limit, submissions should strive for
brevity. Simultaneous submission to the conference and a
post-conference workshop is allowed.


                            TOPICS

p r e c i s i o n  in  c a l c u l a t i o n a l  t e c h n i q u e s=20
for program construction. We solicit high quality papers on original
research, typically in one of the following areas:

  - formal specification of sequential and concurrent programs;
  - constructing implementations to meet specifications;

in particular,

  - program transformation;
  - program analysis;
  - program verification;
  - convincing case studies.

While this list is not exclusive it is intended to show the focus of the
conference.

We expect to publish the proceedings as a Springer LNCS, ready at
the conference.


                             VENUE

Marstrand is a small island on the beautiful westcoast of Sweden, 40
km from G=F6teborg. The charming old houses, the fortress, the walking
paths, and the absence of cars make this island a very pleasant
resort. There are direct flights to G=F6teborg Landvetter from most
European main cities, and busses from G=F6teborg to Marstrand.

I am looking for ( wihtin the next week or two) a Gentzen formulation of
linear logic with no empty sequence at the left.  Girard formulates his
with an empty sequence at the left (1995) and Retore (1997) only does the
multiplicative part.  I would also like a Hilbert-style formulation if one
has ever been written.  Does anyone have any reference(s) or ideas?

Thanks,

M. Mehta

        **** Research studentship leading to a PhD ****
                   University of Manchester,
		Department of Computer Science.

A new research project, `Topological Duality for Modal, Temporal and
Program Logics', has recently been awarded funding by the Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research Council. A three-year PhD studentship 
is on offer on this project. This is an opportunity to join an 
active research group working in applied logic and theoretical 
Computer Science. The student will gain training in research skills 
and learn how to apply mathematics to fundamental problems in 
Computer Science. The Computer Science Department of Manchester 
University is a large and active department, with research activities 
in many aspects of Computer Science. 

The project aims to use new results in modal logic to describe the
behaviour of computing systems. The student will work on applications to 
dynamic logic (a logic of system states), and through this work
will gain a thorough training in modal logic, category theory,
semantics and theoretical computer science. 

Prerequisites are a good degree, at least half of which is mathematics, 
including knowledge of algebra, topology and logic. Some knowledge of
Computer Science, though not essential, would be useful.

The funding covers fees and subsistence for UK citizens, or fees only
for EU citizens. The start date is as soon as possible, and not later
than 1st October 1998.

Investigators: Dr. David Rydeheard and Dr. Harold Simmons,
               with Dr. Barnaby Hilken.

Workshop on Generic Programming
June 18th 1998
Marstrand, Sweden



http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/conf/wgp/

Call for papers

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters.  In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic programs are often quite rich in structure.
For example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, or
even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and theoreticians, but to date have rarely been a
specific focus of research.  Recent developments in functional and
object-oriented programming lead the organizers of this workshop to
believe that there is sufficient interest to warrant the organisation
of a one-day workshop on the theme of generic programming.

The workshop will be on June 18th, 1998, directly following the
Mathematics of Program Construction conference to be held in Marstrand
Sweden.  We cordially invite all those with an active interest in this
important new area to submit a short position paper on their work to
one of the organizers. 

Deadline for submission to the workshop is Feb. 16, 1997. Notification
of acceptance will be March 7, 1997

The organizers are as follows:

      Roland Backhouse (Cochair) Netherlands 
      Tim Sheard (Cochair) USA 
      Johan Jeuring 
      Oege de Moor 
      Bernhard Moeller 
      Jose Oliveira 
      Barry Jay 
      Robin Cocket who is director of the Charity Project

In their book "Homotopy invariant structures on topological structures",
Boardman and Vogt construct from any topological operad O a new one WO,
which can be thought of as a "weakened" version of O in which all the
laws of O now hold only up to homotopy in a coherent way.  

Has there been any subsequent work clarifying this construction?  Here
I'm not interested so much in all the *other* approaches to infinite
loop space machines, as in the notion of "weakening" a topological
operad.  For example, Boardman and Vogt point out that their construction
can be used to discuss homotopy colimits, which makes me wonder if the
construction of WO from O could be done slickly using homotopy colimits.
Has anyone discussed this?

The following is the second part of "The language of analytic
categories", which is a report on my paper CATEGORICAL
GEOMETRY. Please note that Section 6 on integral objects
(which was included in the first part) has been modified in
order to conform with the notion of a primary object by
Diers. The fact is that there are several ways to introduce a
primary object in a general analytic category, and the one give
by Diers (for a Zariski category) happens to be the weakest
one. The new definition of an integral object given below
(being a reduced primary object) is therefore weaker than the
old one given in the first part of this note, but the basic
properties remain the same (see (6.1) - (6.3)). On the other
hand, Diers's definition of an integral object in a Zariski
category (being a quotient of a simple object) is the strongest
one. In practice these definitions agree in most cases (for
instance, see (6.4) and (6.5) below). 

Z. Luo
----------------------------------------------------------------
The opposite RING^op of the category RING of
commutative rings (with unit) is an analytic category, which
is equivalent to the category of affine schemes. Following
Diers we have the following list: 

RING^op 		RING

simple			field	
integral		integral domain
reduced                 without non-null nilpotent 	
			elements
radical			the residue class ring with 	
			respect to its radical
pseudo-simple		exactly one prime ideal
quasi-primary		ab = 0 => (a or b is nilpotent)
primary 		any zero divisor is nilpotent
analytically closed	total ring of quotients
irreducible		the ideal {0} is irreducible with
			respect to intersection
regular			von Neumann regular ring
local			local ring
generic residue		quotient field

SECOND PART
------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Integral Objects

Let C be an analytic category (i.e. a lextensive category with
epi-strong-mono factorizations).

A non-initial object is "primary" if any non-initial analytic
subobject is epic. A non-initial object is "quasi-primary" if 
any two non-initial analytic subobjects has a non-initial
intersection. An "integral" object is a reduced primary object.
A "prime" of an object is an integral strong subobject.  A
non-initial object is "irreducible" if it is not the join of two
proper strong subobjects.

For any object X denote by Spec(X) the set of primes of X. If
U is any analytic subobject of X we denote by X(U) the set of
primes of X which is not disjoint with U, called an "affine
subset" of X. Using (4.3) one can show that the class of affine
subsets is closed under intersection. Thus affine subsets form
a base for a topology on Spec(X). The resulting topological
space Spec(X) is called the "spectrum" of X. Since the
pullback of an analytic mono is analytic, it follows from (6.2)
below that Spec is naturally a functor from C to the
(meta)category of topological spaces. For instance, if C is the
category of affine schemes or affine varieties then Spec
coincides with the classical Zariski topology.

(6.1) Any quotient of a primary object is primary; any primary
object is quasi-primary.

(6.2) Any quotient of an integral object is integral; if f: Y  --> 
X is a map and U a prime of Y, then f^{+1}(U) is a prime of
X.    

(6.3) Any non-initial analytic subobject of a primary object is
primary; any non-initial analytic subobject of an integral
object is integral.

(6.4) Suppose C is locally disjunctable. The following are
equivalent for a non-initial reduced object X:
(a) Any non-initial coflat map to X is epic.
(b) X is primary.
(c) X is quasi-primary.
(d) X is irreducible.
 
(6.5) Suppose C is locally disjunctable. Then
(a) An object is integral iff it is reduced and quasi-primary.
(b) An object is integral iff it is reduced and irreducible.

7. Simple Objects

A mono (or subobject) is called a "fraction" if it is coflat
normal. A map to an object X is called "local" (resp.
"generic") if it is not disjoint with any non-initial strong
subobject (resp. analytic subobject). A map to an object X is
called "quasi-local" if it does not factor through any proper
fraction to X. A map to an object X is called "prelocal" if it
does not factor through any proper analytic mono to X. A
non-initial object is called  "simple" (resp. "extremal simple", 
resp. "unisimple", resp. "pseudo-simple", resp. "quasi-
simple", resp. "presimple") if any non-initial map to it is epic
(resp. extremal epic, resp. unipotent, resp. local, resp. quasi-
local, resp. prelocal).

(7.1) The class of fractions is closed under composition and
stable under pullback.

(7.2) Any local map is quasi-local; any quasi-local map is
prelocal; the class of local (resp. generic, resp. quasi-local,
resp. prelocal) maps is closed under composition; a quasi-
local fraction (resp. prelocal analytic mono) is an
isomorphism.

(7.3) Any unipotent map is both local and generic; any epi is
generic.

(7.4) An object X is simple (resp. extremal simple, resp.
unisimple, resp. quasi-simple, resp. presimple) iff it has
exactly two strong subobjects (resp. subobjects, resp. normal
sieves, resp. fractions, resp. analytic subobjects).

(7.5) Any simple object is integral; any extremal simple object
and any reduced unisimple object is simple.

(7.6) A non-initial object is pseudo-simple iff any non-initial
strong subobject is unipotent; any simple object, extremal
simple object, and unisimple object is pseudo-simple; any
pseudo-simple object is quasi-simple; any quasi-simple object
is presimple; any presimple object is primary.

(7.7) Any reduced pseudo-simple object is simple; the radical
of any pseudo-simple object is simple.

(7.8)  Suppose C is locally disjunctable reducible. The
following are equivalent for an object X:
(a) X is pseudo-simple.
(b) X is quasi-simple. 
(c) X is presimple.
(d) The radical of X is simple.

(7.9) Suppose any coflat unipotent map is regular epic and
any map to a simple object is coflat. Then
(a) Any coflat mono is normal.
(b) Any simple object is extremal simple and unisimple.

8. Local Objects

A non-initial object X is called "local" if non-initial strong
subobjects of X has a non-initial intersection M. An epic
simple fraction of an integral object X  is called a "generic
residue" of X. A mono (or subobject) p: P --> X is called a
"residue" of X if P is a generic residue of  a prime of X. An
object is called "regular" if any disjunctable strong mono to it
is direct. An object is "analytically closed" if any epic analytic
mono to it is an isomorphism. 

(8.1) Suppose X is a local object with the strong subobject M
as above. Then M is the unique simple prime of X; any proper
fraction U of X is disjoint with M; M --> X is a local map.

(8.2) Any integral object has at most one generic residue,
which is the intersection of all the non-initial fractions; any
generic residue is a generic subobject. 

(8.3) Any simple fraction and any simple prime is a residue;
any residue of an object is a maximal simple subobject (i.e. it
is not contained in any other simple subobject); any two
distinct residues of an object are disjoint with each other.

(8.4) Suppose p: P --> U is a residue and u: U --> X is a
fraction (resp. strong mono). Then u.p: P --> X is a residue
of X.

(8.5) Suppose f: P --> Z is a local map with P simple. Then Z
is local and f^{+1}(P) is the simple prime of Z.

(8.6) Suppose f: X --> Z is a local map and X is local. Then Z
is local.

(8.7)  Suppose f: P --> X is a map and P is simple. Then
(a) f is a local epi iff X is simple. 
(b) f is a local strong mono iff X is local with the simple
prime P.
(c) f is an epic fraction iff X is integral with the generic
residue P.

(8.8) Suppose C is locally disjunctable reducible. 
(a) Suppose f: P --> Z is a prelocal map with P simple. Then f
is a local map; Z is a local object with f^{+1}(P) as the simple
prime of Z.
(b) Suppose f: X --> Z is a prelocal map and X is local. Then
f is a local map and Z is a local object.

(8.9) Any sum of regular objects is regular; any extremal
quotient of a regular object is regular; any regular and
presimple object is analytically closed.

(8.10) Suppose C is a complete and cocomplete, well-
powered and co-well-powered analytic category. Then 
(a) The union of any family of subobjects consisting of 
regular objects is regular.
(b) The full subcategory of regular objects is a coreflective
subcategory.

(8.11) Suppose C is a locally disjunctable analytic category.
Then
(a) Any regular object is reduced.
(b) A regular object is integral iff it is simple.

Hi,

I have a simple question concerning the adjoining of intedeterminates
to cartesian (closed) categories. Before asking the question I
describe the two results I am interested in then state my question.

It is possible to adjoin an intedeterminate arrow X: 1 -> C to a
cartesian (closed) category as follows:

Proposition 1:

If C is a cartesian (closed) category, X: 1 -> C an intedeterminate,
and I: C -> C[X] is cartesian (closed) functor, there exists a unique
cartesian functor G: C[X] -> D, such that G(X) = d and the following
diagram commutes:

                     I
		C -------> C[X]
                 \           |
                  \          |
                   \         |
                    \        |
                     \       |
                    F \      | G
                       \     |
                        \    |
                         \   |
                          \  |
                           \ |
                            D,

where D is a cartesian category, F: C -> D is a cartesian functor, and
d: 1 -> F(C).

The proof of this proposition can be given directly or via an
alternative definition in terms of the reader comonad and the
corresponding Klesli construction (personally I find the later simply
and more intuitive). As far as I am aware these constructions were
originally given by Lambek [lam74], proofing the corresponding
deduction theorem for cartesian closed categories, and revised by
Lambek and Scott [lam&sco86].

Although the above result is well known it seems that the result of
adjoining an intedeterminate object to a cartesian closed category, in
particular it's proof, is not so well known. This result may be stated
as follows:

Proposition 2:

If C is a cartesian (closed) category, X an interterminate, and I: C
-> C[X] is a functor, there exists a unique cartesian (closed) functor
G: C[X] -> D, such that G(X) = D, and the following diagram commutes:


                     I
		C -------> C[X]
                 \           |
                  \          |
                   \         |
                    \        |
                     \       |
                    F \      | G
                       \     |
                        \    |
                         \   |
                          \  |
                           \ |
                            D,		

where D is a cartesian (closed) category, F: C -> D is a cartesian
closed functor, and D is in Obj(D).

The problem is that it is not clear how to proof Proposition 2.  I
believe that it is possible to use results from the work of Kelly and
various colleagues in the field of Two-dimensional universal algebra
[back89]. However, I was hoping that there may be a more direct route
to proving this result, which does not rely on the Two-dimensional
monad theory.


My question is simply this:

   Is there a more direct, and hopefully simpler, proof of Proposition 2?

Thank you for any help you can provide on this subject.


Best wishes

The existence is a quick consequence of the standard adjoint functor
theorems.

 Dear Colleagues,

 I wonder whether the following description of a
 free F-conservative completion of any category under
 C-colimits (where  F and  C  are classes of small categories
 such that F is a subclass of C and "F-conservative"
 means "preserving existing F-colimits").

 The description of the cocompletion is as follows:

 Suppose C is a class of small categories and F is
 a subclass of C.

 Let X be any category.
 Denote by [X^op,Set] the quasicategory of all
 functors and all natural transformations between them.
 Denote by F^op-[X^op,Set] the quasicategory of all
 functors which preserve F^op-limits, i.e. limits
 of functors   d : D -> X^op   with D^op in F.

 Claim 1.
 F^op-[X^op,Set] is reflective in [X^op,Set]
 
 (The proof uses the fact that the above Claim 
 holds for the case when X is small - 
 Korollar 8.14 in Gabriel, Ulmer: Lokal
 pr"asentierbare Kategorien.) 


 By Claim 1., F^op-[X^op,Set] has all small colimits.
 Denote by D(X) the closure of X (embedded by Yoneda)
 in F^op-[X^op,Set] under C-colimits. Then one can 
 prove that D(X) is a legitimate category.
 The codomain-restriction  I: X -> D(X)  of the
 Yoneda embedding fulfills the following:

   1. D(X) has C-colimits.
   2. I preserves F-colimits.
   3. D(X) has the following universal property:
      for any functor H : X -> Y which preserves
      F-colimits and the category Y has C-colimits
      there is a unique (up to an isomorphism)
      functor H* : D(X) -> Y such that H* preserves
      C-colimits and H*.I = H.

 In fact, this gives a 2-adjunction between

 C-CAT_C : the 2-quasicategory of all categories having C-colimits,
           all functors preserving C-colimits and all natural
           transformations

 and

 CAT_F : the 2-quasicategory of all categories, all functors
         preserving F-colimits and all natural transformations.

 The result also holds for V-categories, instead of a class C
 of small categories one has to work with a class of small indexing
 types.

 

 Thank you,

I'm looking for a good reference on the relation between
algebraic theories (a la Lawvere) and operads.

Dear Colleagues

This is to announce the availability at

http://www-math.mpce.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/Bigomega.ps

of a short 10 page note which begins as follows:

**********************************************************************

              "The universal property of the multitude of trees"

                        Michael Batanin and Ross Street
                      Macquarie University,  N S W   2109
                                  AUSTRALIA
       Email <mbatanin@mpce.mq.edu.au>  and  <street@mpce.mq.edu.au>
                                November 1997

       Lawvere [BL] essentially pointed out that the category  Delta,
whose objects are finite ordinals and whose arrows are order-preserving
functions, is the generic monoidal category containing a monoid.  Let  Mon
be the category of monoids in the category  Set  of sets.  Bnabou [Be]
pointed out that the (simplicial) nerve of the category  Delta  is the
standard resolution [BB] of the terminal monoid via the comonad generated
by the underlying functor  Mon -->  Set  and its left adjoint.
        Let  Omcat  denote the category of omega-categories and let  Glob
denote the category of globular sets.  In this note we announce a generic
property of the category  BigOmega  whose nerve is the standard resolution
of the terminal omega-category via the comonad generated by the underlying
functor  Omcat --> Glob  and its left adjoint.  We also give a concrete
model for  BigOmega   in terms of trees.  Furthermore, we make connections
with the recent work of Joyal [J].  Full proofs of our claims will appear
elsewhere.

Me too!  The closest thing I know is Boardman and Vogt's
book on homotopy invariant algebraic structures --- which
uses the framework of PROPs rather than operads.
