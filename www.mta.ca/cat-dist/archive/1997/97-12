ftp://www.dima.unige.it/pub/STAFF/GRANDIS


(1). "Limits in double categories",  by Marco Grandis and Robert Pare
Dbl.Dec97.ps

(2). "Weak subobjects and weak limits in categories and homotopy
categories", by M.G.
Var1.Aug97.ps

(3). "Weak subobjects and the epi-monic completion of a category", by M.G.
Var2.Dec97.ps

***

The first was announced on this mailing list, on 13 Nov 1997.
(With respect to the printed preprint, this is a slightly revised version,
containing a more detailed comparison with Bastiani-Ehresmann's "limits
relative to double categories".)

The second and third form an expanded version of a printed preprint
("Variables and weak limits in categories and homotopy categories", Dec
1996), announced on this list on 13 Dec 1996.
Abstracts for (2) and (3) are given below.

***

(2). Abstract. We introduce the notion of "variation", or  "weak
subobject", in a category, as an extension of the notion of subobject. The
dual notion is called a covariation, or weak quotient.
    Variations are important in homotopy categories, where they are well
linked to weak limits, much in the same way as, in "ordinary" categories,
subobjects are linked to limits. Thus, "homotopy variations" for a space
S,  with respect to the homotopy category  HoTop,  form a lattice  Fib(S)
of "types of fibration" over  S.
    Nevertheless, the study of weak subobjects in ordinary categories, like
abelian groups or groups, is interesting in itself and relevant to classify
variations in homotopy categories of spaces, by means of homology and
homotopy functors.   (To appear in: Cahiers Top. Geom. Diff. Categ.)

(3). Abstract. Formal properties of weak subobjects are considered. The
variations in a category  X  can be identified with the (distinguished)
subobjects in the epi-monic completion of  X,  or Freyd completion  FrX,
the free category with epi-monic factorisation system over  X,  which
extends the Freyd embedding of the stable homotopy category of spaces in an
abelian category (P. Freyd, Stable homotopy, La Jolla 1965).
    If  X  has products and weak equalisers, as  HoTop  and various other
homotopy categories,  FrX  is complete. If  X  has zero-object, weak
kernels and weak cokernels, as the homotopy category of pointed spaces,
then  FrX  is a "homological" category. Finally, if  X  is triangulated,
FrX  is abelian and the embedding  X --> FrX  is the universal homological
functor on  X,  as in the original case. These facts have consequences on
the ordered sets of variations.

From: James Stasheff <jds@math.upenn.edu>

Dear colleagues,
I'm writing to you about a proposed e-print archive in category theory,
on behalf of a committee of mathematicians which is advocating
the unification of various electronic preprint servers and archives into a single 
system with a common format.  We want to invite Category Theorists to join this
group. 

This invitation is being issued to 15 preprint servers (listed below) which
together cover about half of the subject areas in mathematics.  We are 
also trying to organize active groups in the remaining subject areas, so
that the unified preprint server will soon cover all of mathematics.  This
organizational effort has already produced interested groups in
combinatorics and geometric topology.

Managing a preprint server can be a time-consuming task, but fortunately
there is a similar preprint server in operation in physics, running at Los
Alamos National Lab and funded by the National Science Foundation, whose
staff is willing to take on the operation of a unified mathematics server.
This will enable all of us to take advantage of their years of software
development, as well as their efficient staff who monitor the (fully
automated) operation.  When scientific questions arise (such as the
suitability of a particular paper for a particular archive), these staff
members would consult with a designated "moderator" for each subject
area.  (The moderator also receives abstracts of papers as they are 
submitted, and can have the staff intervene in the rare instances of 
inappropriate papers or other difficulties.)  Someone you designate 
collectively would serve in this capacity under the new system.

The great advantage of a unified server is that all mathematicians will be
able to participate in electronic preprint exchanges in a single, flexible
system (which can distribute preprints in a variety of formats, including
dvi, ps and pdf).  The computer systems staff in a mathematics department
can be asked to familiarize themselves with this system, which will be easy
to support for users.  Moreover, a central location for preprints (with
dozens of mirror sites worldwide) together with a soon-to-be-familiar
scheme for citing these preprints will mean that mathematicians in one
field who see a citation to a preprint in another field will easily be able
to locate it.  We will also all gain the ability to simultaneously search 
through related archives, including full text searches. There is a common 
keyword index for the mathematical holdings, permitting simultaneous searching 
of all or designated related archives. A given paper could easily be relevant 
to users of more than one archive, so this would make information much easier 
to track.

In order to take advantage of the system in place at Los Alamos Lab, we
have agreed to follow the technical decisions they have made: authors
are asked to submit tex source files, for example.  Although this may be a
change for users of your current system, we believe that the long-term
advantages of unification outweigh the temporary disadvantages to users of
an established archive.

We propose to copy the contents of your archive (in its current form) into
the unified archive, and suggest that you encourage all future submissions
be made directly to the unified archive.  Category theory is one of the 
subject areas in the unified archive  and is intended as a continuation of your 
archive.  It should be fairly easy to
construct a kind of front-end on a web page at your site which will provide
access to both old and new papers in your portion of the unified archive,
giving your users a certain degree of continuity and allowing them to
retain the feeling of belonging to a smaller community of users of a
particular preprint archive.  We will be happy to assist in the
construction of such front-ends.  A primitive prototype for such a front-end
(in the area of combinatorics) can be viewed at http://eprints.math.duke.edu/archive/CO/
All but one of the links on that page take you directly into the archive at
Los Alamos.

A front-end for the entire unified archive is under construction at
U.C. Davis by Greg Kuperberg:  you can view it at
   http://front.math.ucdavis.edu
You might also like to look at the Los Alamos Math Archive itself (partially
functioning already), at
   http://xxx.lanl.gov/form/math
You will see that the combinatorics and geometric topology sections are
getting a good start this week.  At the time of unification (probably
Jan. 1) the four current math archives alg-geom, dg-ga, funct-an and q-alg
at the Los Alamos site will be merged into the unified archive, becoming
subject areas AG, DG, part of FA, and QA, respectively.

Our committee has had Joe Christie, Greg Kuperberg, Dave Morrison, Dick
Palais, Jim Stasheff and Mark Steinberger as its active participants, with
occasional participation by a few others.  If you are interested in having
a representative of category theory joining
this committee, we would love to have one.  Our tasks after this
unification will be developing the remaining subject areas, and publicizing
this archive among mathematicians.

	Short of that, as individuals, all you need to do right now
is write back and say you think the category theory category is a good idea,
or better yet, to pledge some number of e-prints to be submitted soon
after the category starts. Those already archived other than on your
own server should be offered with a copy of the offer going to the
archive administrator.  Of course we are most eager to have your present
and future e-prints added to the unified server.  (For e-print versions
of papers for which you no longer have the copyright, permission from the 
copyright holder will be needed.)

	I am very optimistic that this effort will eventually lead to a complete
transition to efficient electronic distribution of new results in
category theory.  The xxx archives has 3,000 math e-prints in the four
existing mathematics categories and 50,000 physics e-prints.  As you
might guess from these numbers, xxx has already effected the electronic
transition in several areas of physics.  The category theory category will
be of great benefit to us all.  Please help get it started; the more who join, 
the better.

  Best regards,

  	Jim Stasheff

	Dear friends, I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at 
Departamento de Informatica, UFPE, Brazil, and I need to study the
theory of sheaves and its conexion with logic. However I am finding some
dificulties concerning matterials who have an intuitive explanation of the
subject. I am reading Michael Fourman and D. Scott's Sheaves and Logic
paper. It would be helpful if you could give me an intuition
about the following questions:

	Is there any intuition about the notions of global and local
objects? 

	What is the connection between global and local objects, and, for
example, partial and total functions?

	Is there any intuition about the existence predicate
E:|A|->\omega?

	What is a singleton?

	In the paper "Identity and Existence", in the same proceedings,
Scott formalized the notion of partial objects (e.g.partial functions).
If we are modelling the standard intuitionistic logic,
the local objects makes sense? Let me explain what I want to get.
Is sheaves an adequate model for intuitionistic logic just when we
want to formalize the notion of partial objects? And if we are working
with standard intuitionistic logic, does the category of structure
generated by a first order theory contain strutures with, for example, 
partial functions?

	Is there any intuitive written material about the subject?

I am all in favor of Jim Stasheff's proposal, but what does one do about
the fact that I, for example, have my own personal macros files and
my TeX files cannot be compiled without them.  If this is to be a
straitjacket, I would just as soon maintain our own server with dvi and
ps files.  I am also just a bit wary of distributing the tex source,
since it is so easily changed.  Not that dvi and ps files can't be
changed, but it is certainly a good deal harder.

Michael

CONCUR 98: Purpose and Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory
of concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this
topic is continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance
 of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

The scope of CONCUR'98 covers all areas of semantics, logics, and
verification techniques for concurrent systems.  A list of specific
topics includes (but is not limited to) concurrency related aspects of
models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems
and algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming
and verification.


Submissions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submissions should consist of a 100-200 word ASCII abstract and a
summary (up to 15 pages, typeset 12 points; about 7000 words,
excluding bibliography and figures).  Simultaneous submissions to
other conferences or journals are not allowed.  Electronic submissions
are strongly encouraged; instructions may be found at the CONCUR'98
web page, or obtained by sending an email with subject ``submission
information'' to the address c98-subm@sophia.inria.fr.  If surface
mail is used, then five (5) copies of the paper should be sent to the
following address: Concur'98, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, BP 93, F-06902

Preprint servers of the sort Jim is describing have facilities for
uploading macro files, postscript files, etc. along with the TeX
files.   I use them a lot and they work.

I think the relationship between algebraic theories and (non-symmetric,
non-topological) operads is quite simply described. Loosely, algebras for
operads are just the same as algebras for strongly regular theories. To be
more precise: any operad gives rise to a monad on Set, the algebras for which
are the algebras for the operad; a monad on Set arises from an operad iff it
arises from a strongly regular theory. So -

	operadic monads are strongly regular theories.


Carboni & Johnstone (1995) call an equation _strongly regular_ if on each
side the same variables appear in the same order, without repetition (e.g.
(x.y).z=x.(y.z) and x-(y-z)=(x-y)+z, but not x.y=x, x.y=y.x or
(x.x).y=x.(x.y)). A theory is called strongly regular if it can be presented
by operators and strongly regular equations - for instance, the theory of
monoids. They show that a monad (T, eta, mu) on Set is from a s.r. theory
("is s.r.") iff
	(i)   T is finitary
	(ii)  T preserves wide pullbacks
      & (iii) eta and mu are cartesian.
(A wide pullback is a limit over a diagram (X_i --> X) where i ranges over
some set I, e.g. if I=2 it's an ordinary pullback.)

1. Operadic => strongly regular

If A is an operad, with the function A --> N={natural numbers}, then the
functor part of the induced monad T on Set is defined by the pullback square

	T(X) ----> W(X)
	 |          |
	 |          | W(!)
	 |          |
	 V          V
	 A ------> W(1)=N

 where X is a set and W (for Words) is the free-monoid monad. One can show
(e.g. my (1997, sec 4.6)) that the unit and multiplication of T are
cartesian. Moreover, one can also show that
	(a) if W preserves colimits of a given shape then so does T
      & (b) if W preserves I-ary pullbacks then so does T.
Since the theory of monoids is s.r., W preserves all filtered colimits (i.e.
is finitary) and all wide pullbacks. So T satisfies (i)-(iii) and is
therefore s.r.. 

2. Strongly regular => operadic

Conversely, take a s.r. theory T. Any s.r. presentation of T gives rise to a
natural transformation T --> W which is cartesian and preserves the monad
structure. It follows by my (1997, sec 4.6) that the monad T comes from some
operad A.

But you don't need to.  You can also upload a bunch of
separate files using the uufiles program obtainable from 
the preprint archive.  It's painless and easy.

Information on this and a million other technical issues
is available at the archives themselves.  Try:

http://eprints.math.duke.edu/

or send email with subject header "help" to 

q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu

> as for the plagarism issue, I will let the experts respond

I'm no expert, but I don't see what the problem is.  If you
upload your paper to one of these archives, the paper 
itself and the exact date and time it was first received is 
publicly accessible, so any attempt by anyone to plagiarize 
it would be incredibly easy to prove.  If you store your papers 
on your own site, it's much harder to prove you wrote them before 
someone else.  This is one reason why highly competitive
physicists rush to put their papers on the archives as
quickly as possible: to get a certified time stamp on their paper!

Anyway, I've never heard of any problems with plagiarism actually 
happening.

In case it's not been made sufficiently clear, the main
advantages of having all papers on a given subject stored
electronically at a single institution are:

1) they are easy to find
2) they are easy to refer to 
2) they stay there, archived, while the authors move from 
institution to institution and ultimately perish.  Will our 
institutions keep our websites going after we die, while 
technology continues to change?

Many of my papers (or pointers to them) appear on Ginsparg-style 
preprint archive, my own website, Hypatia, Mathematical Reviews, 
the category theory mailing list, and paper journals --- all of 
which serve different purposes.  Presumably some of these systems
will fall into disuse in a natural sort of way as time passes.  
I wouldn't advocate the brutal elimination of existing systems.
I think the question now is: would category theory be served by 
creation of a Ginsparg-style preprint archive for the subject?

I've done my best on this, for two weeks. There comes a point at which
one calls for help, because one isn't seeing it.

A full-rank set of vectors in a vector space defines a basis, obviously.
And given an n-dimensional  Euclidean manifold, with specified origin,
an arbitrary set of n points, "in general position" (i.e. not contained
in any proper subspace), defines a basis for it.

In other words, a choice of simplex defines a choice of frame.

Now, MacLane sets this up as an example of the "free-forgetful" adjoint
relationship. Postulate functors V, U between the two categories:


                V ->
        Set(s)          Vect(or Spaces)
                <- U

and domains I in Set, and V in Vect.

The adjunction is:

        V I   ->  P             U P  <-  I

        UV I  ->  U P           VU P <-  VI
        |      /                |      /
        ^     /                 v     /
        |u   /                  |n   /
        |   /                   |   /
          I                       P

The interpretation is:

        V : Set -> Vect

takes a set I to V I, the span of I over some field. (Set-to-set arrows
go to linear maps.)

        U : Vect -> Set

is the forgetful functor, taking each vector space to "its underlying set";
which as far as one can tell, is the vector space considered as the total
set of linear combinations of the basis elements, with all arrows mapped
to nowhere-land.

The adjoint isomorphism is:

        [ V I  -> P ]   ~~   [ I -> U P ]
           frame                simplex

That makes sense, as far as it goes. Now consider the unit and counit.

        u: id(Sets)  ->  U V

        => u(I): I ->  UV(I)

        is the natural transformation from any set I to the elements
        of its span; which set is isomorphic to R^|I|, and can be read
        as the flat space in which I resides. That makes sense if I is
        a set of points, but is meaningless if I is, say, the set {1,2,3}.

        n : V U -> id(Vect)

        =>  n(P) : VU(P) -> P

        is the natural transformation from the span of the set of elements
        of a vector space, to the space itself. But the set of elements
        is infinite. VU(P) would have to be a vector space with an infinite
        basis.

My perplexities:

(1) As above, the unit and counit do meaningless things.

(2) The vector spaces defined by V are free on I. It's meaningless to
ask whether the elements of I are in general position; they are assumed
to be. But in a geometric interpretation, one wants to introduce the
arrows to the Boolean domain:

        C2 : P x P -> B : condition for two points to coincide

        C3: P x P x P -> B: " " 3 points to be collinear

        C4: PxPxPxP -> B:   " " 4 points to be coplanar

        .... and so on up to |I|.

There has to be a sensible place to plug these into Vect, and I expected
the adjoint construction to be it.

(3) Otherwise, what is the damn thing good for? By comparison, the
Diagonal-Product and Product-Exponential units and counits are the
most useful things about those constructions; and the Free-Forgetful
adjunction for monoids gives us the Kleene closure. But the Free-
Forgetful adjunction for Vect almost seems vacuous.


An alternative way to see the problem is, to say that Set is not the
right category to be looking for adjoints in. Geometrically, we want
Vect to be related not to spaces, but to "linear structures" on spaces,
in the sense that a manifold atlas genuinely describes a differentiable
structure. Maybe we want something like:

               V ->
        Flat            Vect
               <- U

where Flat (= linear structure) is equipped with the incidence arrows
C2, C3,.., C|I|, and admits only  m : Flat -> Flat which are U-images
of the exterior products in Vect, and preserve the C's.

This is related to the question: is the exterior product (i.e. determinant)
the unit of some adjunction?

Any help really appreciated.

        Grothendieck's proof that every AB5 category has enough injectives
uses the axiom of choice (actually Zorn's lemma--which John Bell points out
to me is significantly weaker than choice in toposes). And the proof in
Johnstone's TOPOS THEORY that the category of Abelian groups over any
Grothendieck topos has enough injectives uses Barr's theorem: Every
Grothendieck topos is covered by one that satisfies the axiom of choice.
This theorem itself assumes the axiom of choice in the base topos (i.e. the
one over which the others are Grothendeick).

        Are there any good results showing how necessary the axiom of
choice, or Zorn's lemma, is to these results?

Even to prove that there is a non-zero injective abelian group needs a
little bit of choice, but only a little.  (By contrast, the statement that
every divisible abelian group is injective is equivalent to the axiom of
choice.)  The details are in my paper "Injectivity, projectivity, and the
axiom of choice" (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 255 (1979) 31--59).

An open letter to Jim Stasheff,
re the proposed unified electronic preprint archive for mathematics

Dear Jim,

Last week you published a proposal for a unified electronic preprint
archive in mathematics, at
	http://xxx.lanl.gov/list/math/info
making use of the software at Los Alamos National Laboratory which
was written by Paul Ginsparg, originally for a certain branch of Physics.
Following our extensive semi-private correspondence on this subject,
I think it is time for me to write something to the "categories" list.

First, I want to commend the efforts of yourself and your committee
in taking the initiative to call for a unified archive. Mathematics
is a notoriously parochial subject, and the existence of such a central
resource may in the long term help us to form The Big Picture.

Having said this about the mathematical issues, I am unhappy about
the way in which this proposal has been made in terms of management
and technical issues.  Such a unified archive will immediately acquire
considerable de facto authority, and it creates a monopoly over the
means of publication in mathematics which is potentially far more
significant than the contraints of the existing journal system from
which we are trying to free ourselves.  You have also accepted wholesale
Paul Ginsparg's design decisions, some of which may be accidents of
implementation.  In several respects there are or could be other
paradigms of electronic publishing, which ought to be encouraged to
co-exist with his ways of doing things, so that the community at large
can decide over a period of years which method is to be preferred.

I am worried that you may be making assumptions that things have to be
done in one way when in fact alternatives are possible.
In short, the proposal should have been "put out to tender" for other
software designs and implementations to compete on fair terms on the
basis of the facilities that they provide to authors and readers.

In these respects this issue is analogous to the debate about TeX macros
for commutative diagrams, on which a certain amount of blood was spilt
some years ago.  In that case someone who had used package X proposed
that there be an electronic journal in category theory in TeX source,
standarding on package X for commutative diagrams, without being aware
of the existence of packages Y, Z, ... Actually this is quite different:
in using TeX, or whatever technology they use for their papers, authors
are making a considerable commitment, and some of us have made a far greater
commitment by writing and maintaining macro packages.  In the case of
electronic dissemination (of existing files), papers can easily be copied
to and linked from many different places without any further effort
by the author.

Nevertheless, bad decisions at this stage about the database which says
where everything (and everybody) is could be significant handicaps in the
development of the technology at a later date.

I therefore beg you at least to stay the widespread advertising of the
new archive until its potential competitors have had a chance to
discuss the way in which they should co-operate and compete.

I intend to contact Paul Ginsparg myself to discuss some technical issues.
In particular I have a number of suggestions to make about the process
of registering authors and submitting papers. His collected bibliographical
data should be provided in BibTeX format for processing by other services.
It would also be possible to integrate his author registration with Hypatia's,
which would greatly enhance the usefulness of both systems.  In fact it is
remarkable how closely the strengths of one system coincide with the
shortcomings of the other.

Yours,
Paul Taylor

PS The technical discussion which I have been having with Jim Stasheff,
Bob Rosebrugh, Mike Barr and others has now moved to a new email list
run from Queen Mary and Westfield College.  Details of how to join this,
together with the archive of the discussion and other information, can
be found at
	http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/html/eprint.html

This message is followed by a separate one on the issue of submission
in TeX source form.

From: Paul Taylor <pt@dcs.qmw.ac.uk>

Following Jim Stasheff's announcement of a unified maths eprint archive
on the "categories" list, one issue which provoked a strong reaction
was the requirement that papers be submitted in TeX source form.

Mike Barr and others pointed out that they use versions of macro packages
which cannot reasonably be expected to work under automatic control or
in the hands of anyone apart from themselves.  I agree very strongly with
their views.

I claimed in a previous email that the main site at Los Alamos accepts
submissions in numerous formats but that the implementation at Duke
University, where several existing maths servers exist, restricts this to TeX.

I have spent most of today reading the documentation at xxx.lanl.gov
and it has given me a headache: electronic methods have a very long
way to go to compete with paper when it comes to reading the whole
of a lengthy technical document.

So, my claim was wrong.  Paul Ginsparg has very strong views in favour
of TeX (source):
	http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/faq/whytex.html
and against alternative formats such as PostScript.  I agree with a lot
of what he says,  and would even stick my neck out to suggest that
Mike Barr probably does too.  However, Mike and I feel very strongly
that being forced to submit TeX source is a straitjacket,  and you can
expect us to continue arguing this vigorously (and informedly).

Curiously, Paul Ginsparg doesn't discuss DVI (the output of (La)TeX) as
an archive format, this being the one for which I would argue.
TeX and PostScript are programming languages, but DVI is a very simple
and robust "byte code".  For anyone worried about the "doomsday scenario"
that TeX will no longer exist in 100 years time, the structure of DVI
is simple enough that it could be decyphered from existing binary files
and a viewer recreated.  After all, this was done for hieroglyphs
in the 19th century, without the aid of the very sophisicated hardware
and artificial intelligence techniques which we can expect to exist
in the future. 

Ginsparg's archives have been running since 1991 and (according to his
statistics) take a considerable volume of traffic.  From TeX source
he generates several other formats, configurably by the reader, apparently
on the fly.  To promise to do this and still keep your head above water
requires an extremely robust system, as I know from having run a major
TeX implementation for many years.  There is also a lot of documentation
about configuring your web browser to accept files in formats for which
Netscape was never designed.  In other words, he seems to have a very
professional way of delivering files to readers.  I take my hat off
to him, because this is a conspicuous weakness of Hypatia.

Whatever the arguments and counterarguments about this particular issue,
I suggest that a more liberal attitude to archive submission formats
be taken by this and other archives.

Paul Taylor

PS There was also some discussion of plagiarism, on which subject
        http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/nch/www/koala-info.html
is interesting.

Bob - we have had more troubles with triples, and it is down and out for
the time being.  Can you please make appropriate adjustments to the
categories list, and perhaps post this message to the list as well?  All
email addresses with "triples" in them ought to just have the "triples"
dropped, so, eg, barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca would become
barr@math.mcgill.ca, and similarly (for example) for bunge, fox, hermida,
lambek, makkai, rags, ruet.  The aliasing system we had on triples for the
category community is of course not functioning. If there are any problems
with email, get in touch with me (rags) or barr (@math.mcgill.ca) and
we'll see what can be done.

FTP and HTTP url's with "triples" in them will also not work, of course.
Some of us have home pages on other machines in the maths dept - those
will still function.  Our papers are mirrored by Hypatia, so one should
check out that site for most purposes.  (There is a link on my www page,
listed below, if you don't know how to get there.)  

We hope this problem will be short-lived, bear with us in the meantime.

best regards, Robert

                  Categorical  Rewriting
     ---------------------------------------------------
     RTA'98 Workshop & Tutorial - Call for Participation


The fact that category theory can provide a semantics for rewriting at
a level of abstraction between concrete syntax and the relational
models given by abstract reduction systems is beginning to be used
with increasing success in rewriting.

The aim of this workshop and tutorial is to provide an opportunity for
the participants of RTA'98 to learn more about categorical term
rewriting, and to provide a meeting place for researchers within the
field to present and discuss new ideas where category theory can be
fruitfully applied to rewriting.

The workshop and tutorial will occupy one afternoon of RTA'98. The
tutorial will comprise introductory talks about the categorical
concepts relevant to term rewriting, such as the theory of monads. For
the workshop, talks are invited about work applying categorical or
algebraic concepts to term rewriting or related areas, such as graph
rewriting, string rewriting or unification.

Important dates are as follows:

 31 January 1998      Submission deadline
 15 February 1998     Notification of acceptance and final programme
 1 March 1998         Final versions are due for the informal proceedings
 31 March 1998        RTA 98 Workshop & Tutorial on Categorical Rewriting

For more information and instructions on submitting a talk see one of

        http://www.etl.go.jp/~ferjan/CatTRS.html
        http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~cxl/rta98/workshop.html

Registration for the workshop (with or without submitting a talk)
should be done via the RTA registration form at

9. Analytic Geometries 

An "analytic geometry" is an analytic category satisfying the
following axioms:
(Axiom 4) Any intersection of strong subobjects exists.
(Axiom 5) Any non-initial object has a non-initial reduced
strong subobject.
(Axiom 6) Any strong subobject is an intersection of
disjunctable strong subobjects.
Thus an analytic geometry is a perfect, reducible, and locally
disjunctable analytic category. 

Suppose C is an analytic geometry.

(9.1) Any object has a radical; the full subcategory of reduced
subobjects is a reduced analytic geometry.

(9.2) If X is the join of two strong subobjects U and V in
R(X), then {U, V} is a unipotent cover on X.

(9.3) If U and V are two strong subobjects of an object X,
then rad(U \vee V) = rad(U) \vee rad(V).

(9.4)  Denote by D(X) the set of reduced strong subobjects of
X.  The radical mapping rad: R(X) --> D(X) is the right
adjoint of the inclusion D(X) --> R(X), which preserves finite
joins. 

(9.5) The dual D(X)^{op} of the lattice D(X) is a locale; a
reduced strong subobject is integral if and only if it is a prime
element of D(X)^{op}. 

(9.6) The spectrum Spec(X) of an object X is homeomorphic
to the space of points of  the locale D(X)^{op} (therefore is a
sober space); an analytic geometry is spatial iff D(X)^{op} is
a spatial locale for each object X.

(9.7) The functor sending each object X to D(X)^{op} and
each map f: Y --> X to rad(f)^{-1} is equivalent to the
analytic topology on C (cf. [L4]).

(9.8) If V is a strong subobject of a non-initial object X in a
spatial analytic geometry then the join of all the primes
contained in V is the radical of V.

(9.9) A non-initial reduced object X in a spatial analytic
geometry is integral iff its spectrum is irreducible.

(9.10) Suppose f: Y --> X is a mono in a spatial analytic
geometry. If f is coflat then Spec(f) is a topological
embedding; if f is analytic then Spec(f) is an open embedding; 
if f is strong then Spec(f) is a closed embedding.

(9.11) (Chinese remainder theorem) Let X be an object in a
strict analytic geometry. Suppose U_1, U_2, ..., U_n are
strong subobjects of X such that U_i, U_j are disjoint for all i
\neq j, then the induced map \sum U_i --> \vee U_i is an
isomorphism.
--------------------------------------------------------------
10.  Zariski Geometries

Most of the results stated in this section are due to Diers (in
the dual situation). Our purpose is to present a geometric
approach using the language of analytic categories developed
above.

A category is "coherent" if  the following three axioms are
satisfied:
(Axiom 7) It is locally finitely copresentable.
(Axiom 8) Finite sums are disjoint and stable.
(Axiom 9) The sum of its terminal object with itself is finitely
copresentable.
It is easy to see that a coherent category is an analytic
category. A "Zariski geometry" (resp. "Stone geometry") is a
locally disjunctable (resp. locally decidable) coherent
category. 

Diers proved in [D1] that a locally finitely copresentable
category is a coherent category (resp. Stone geometry) iff its
full subcategory of finitely copresentable objects is lextensive
(resp. lextensive and decidable). Note that a category is a
coherent category (resp. Stone geometry) iff its opposite is a
"locally indecomposable category" (resp. "locally simple
category") in the sense of [D1]. 

Let C be a coherent category. A map f: Y --> X is called
"indirect" if it does not factor through any proper direct mono
to X. A non-initial object is "indecomposable" if it has exactly
two direct subobjects. A maximal indecomposable subobject
is called an "indecomposable component".  

(10.1)  Any non-initial object has a simple prime and an
extremal simple subobject; a coherent category is a spatial
reducible perfect analytic category.

(10.2) Cofiltered limits and products of coflat maps are
coflat; intersections of coflat monos are coflat monos;
intersections of fractions are fractions; any map can be
factored uniquely as a quasi-local map followed by a fraction.

(10.3) Any composite of locally direct mono is locally direct;
any map can be factored uniquely as an indirect map followed
by a locally direct mono.

(10.4) Any non-initial object has an indecomposable
component; an indecomposable subobject is an
indecomposable component iff it is a locally direct subobject.

(10.5) The extensive topology is naturally a strict metric
topology, which is determined by the canonical functor to the
category of Stone spaces (preserving cofiltered limits and
colimits whose right adjoint preserving sums).

(10.6) A Stone geometry is a strict reduced Zariski geometry
whose opposite is a regular category, and its analytic
topology coincides with the extensive topology. 

Let C be a Zariski geometry. A "locality" is a fraction with a
local object as domain. A "local isomorphism" is a map f: Y --
> X such that, for any locality v: V  --> Y, the composite f.v:
V  --> X is a locality. A complement of a set of strong monos
is called a "semisingular mono". Note that  (10.13) below
implies that our definitions of reduced and integral objects
coincide with those of Diers's in a Zariski geometry. 

(10.8) A Zariski geometry is a spatial analytic geometry; The
spectrum Spec(X) of any object is a coherent space for any
object X; if f: Y --> X is a unipotent map then Spec(f) is
surjective.

(10.9) If f: Y --> X is a finitely copresentable (i.e. f is a
finitely copresentable object in C/X) local isomorphism, then
Spec(f): Spec(Y) --> Spec(X) is an open map.

(10.10) A simple subobject on an object is a residue iff it is
maximal (i.e. it is not contained in any larger simple
subobject); any integral object X has a unique generic residue.
 
(10.11) (Going Up Theorem) If f: Y --> X is a coflat map and 
V is in the image of Spec(f), any prime of X containing V is
also in the image of Spec(f) (i.e. the image of Spec(f) is
closed under generalizations).

(10.12) Any colimits and cofiltered limits of reduced objects
is reduced; the full subcategory of reduced objects is a
reduced Zariski geometry.

(10.13) An object is integral (resp. reduced) iff it is a quotient
of a simple object (resp. a coproduct of simple objects).

(10.14) A Zariski geometry is strict iff any finite analytic
cover is not contained in any proper subobject. Suppose C is
strict. A mono is analytic iff it is singular (resp. a finitely
copresentable fraction); a mono is a fraction iff it is
semisingular (resp. a local isomorphism); a mono is direct iff
it is strong and analytic.

Colin's question, which essentially asks for a solution to the proportion
abelian groups:groups :: abelian category:x
does not of course have a unique answer.  One solution was exact
category and that was definitely one of the things I had in mind.  In
fact, I think I even said so.  From my current vantage, I would add
the following two properties: pointed and Mal'cev.  For an equational
category, that is almost enough to force a group structure (associativity
is missing).  I don't know how to force associativity by categorical
properties, but pointed, exact and Mal'cev has to come awfully close
to answering the question.

	I guess it was cryptic. And maybe it is trivial once 
spelled out. The thing is that I am writing a note on the Abelian 
category axioms as a foundation for the general theory of linear 
transformations, or of transformations linear over a given ring, 
etc. It is a reply to several of Sol Feferman's old complaints
about categorical foundations which he recently affirmed unchanged
on another e-mail list.

	In preparation I noticed that Emmy Noether used to look for
"set theoretic foundations of group theory" by which she meant
foundations that would NOT refer to elements or operations but would
take the notion of quotient group as basic--and rely on her
homomorphism and isomorphism theorems. By "group theory" she
meant the study of varous categories. At least: the category of all
groups, the category of groups with a fixed set of operators on
them and homomorphisms prserving the operators, and the same
for Abelian groups in place of all groups. Her Abelian groups with
a fixed set of operators are in effect modules over a fixed ring.

	She was hugely attached to non-commutative algebras and 
to the generality of her proto-category-theoretic methods. She
tends to present "all groups" and "commutative groups" as very
similar things. I believe that most logicians today and philosophers
of math also see these as quite similar, and that's who I'm
writing for.

	So far as I see, they are not very similar categorically.
The Abelian category axioms nicely suit Noether's goals for
the Abelian cases--her homomorphism and isomorphism theorems
become definitions and axioms on kernels and cokernels. I don't
know anything comparable for all groups (or all groups with
operators).

	You could axiomatize the category of all groups by, in
effect, axioms for the category of sets (to be construed as free
groups) plus the quotients given by the triple for groups over sets.
And the same for groups with any set of operators. You could do
the same for Abelian groups (or modules over fixed ring) but this
is far less elegant than the Abelian category axioms with a 
projective generator--which you can then relate to set theory if
you like by assuming completeness and that the generator is small. 
The triples approach axiomatizes completeness first, and the group 
structure as an add-on to it.

	Are there known axioms for the category of groups that do
not in effect axiomatize the category of sets at the same time?
Anything as elegant as the Abelian category axioms--though of course
elegance is often in the eye of the beholder.

Thanks, Colin

	In an earlier post today I misdescribed a way of axiomatizing
the category of groups by the triple for groups over sets. The point is
that you can axiomatize the category of sets and the Eilenberg-Moore
category for the triple for groups over it, and then identify the 
category of sets with the non-full subcategory of free groups and 
homomorphisms taking generators to generators; so that in a very narrow 
sense you would "only be talking about groups and homomorphisms". But 
really this amounts to defining groups as structured sets.

	What I want to know is, are there known axioms approaching
the category of groups directly.

        This gives an approach I had not thought of, and should have: take
axioms for the category of categories, and change the description of the
generator 2 to make it a groupoid.

        For the category of categories, 2 has no non-constant, non-identity
endofunctors.  For the category of groupoids it has exactly one, and that is
an involution. (By a constant functor I mean one factoring through the
terminal category 1.) A few other changes might be needed, depending on
details of the axioms for the category of categories. But the key seems to
be that the category of groupoids is cartesian closed and its insertion into
the category of categories preserves exponentials--the prominent fact that a
natural transformation with all components iso is a natural iso. So the
center of the strength of the cat-of-cats axioms can be kept unchanged for
the cat of groupoids. 

        This is somehow orthogonal to the approach Mike Barr suggested, in
that cartesian closedness of the category of categories is very close to
associativity of composition. Mike lost associativity, but kept groups as
opposed to groupoids. Anders's strategy gets associativity/cc-ness by
foregoing uniqueness of objects. I have no idea how far this shows something
objective, and how far it is an accident of the approaches we've thought of.

                         Call for Papers

                  Workshop on Generic Programming

                 June 18th 1998, Marstrand, Sweden

    (In Conjunction with Mathematics of Program Construction Conference)

              http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/conf/wgp/


Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making them more
general.  A generic program embodies some sort of polymorphism; ordinary 
programs are obtained from it by suitably instantiating its parameters. The
parameters may be other programs, types or type constructors, or even 
programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to 
practitioners and theoreticians, but to date have rarely been a specific 
focus of research.  Recent developments in functional and 
object-oriented programming lead the organizers of this workshop to believe 
that there is sufficient interest to warrant the organisation of a one-day
workshop on the theme of generic programming.  The workshop will be on 
June 18th, 1998, following on from the Mathematics of Program Construction 
conference.  

The goal of the workshop is to inventorise the full diversity of research 
activities in the area of generic programming, both theoretical and applied, 
by attracting as wide a spectrum of participants as possible to the workshop. 
The results of the workshop will be published in the form of a detailed summary
of all presentations, prepared by the organizers and made available on 
internet.

We cordially invite all those with an active interest in this important new 
area to submit a short position paper on their work to Roland Backhouse
(rolandb@win.tue.nl).  The position paper should outline your current research
activities in this area and include references to published papers and/or 
web links to technical reports where more information can be found.  
The recommended length is approximately three pages.  The
deadline for submission is 16th February, 1998.   Notification of acceptance 
will be on or before 15th March, 1998.



The organizers are as follows:

Roland Backhouse (Cochair), Netherlands   Tim Sheard (Cochair), USA
Robin Cockett, Canada                     Barry Jay, Australia
Johan Jeuring, Sweden                     Karl Lieberherr, USA                
Oege de Moor, UK                          Bernhard Moeller, Germany
Jose Oliveira, Portugal                   Fritz Ruehr, USA
