			Abstract	

Originally, the categorical calculus of relations was developed using
the canonical factorisation in regular categories. More recently,
relations restricted to a proper factorisation system have been
studied by several authors. In the present paper, we consider the
general situation, in which relations are induced by an arbitrary
stable factorisation. This extension of the calculus of relations is
necessary for a categorical development of strongly constructive (and
computational) logic, where non-monic relations come about naturally.

In this setting, we analyze the correspondence of the maps, i.e. the
total, single-valued relations, and the functions, as given by the
arrows in the underlying category.

There was a gap in section 3 of my paper "Maps I", announced here on
Friday. I noticed and fixed it on Sunday, but some people had already
downloaded it. Sorry about this.

	Has anyone here seen Piaget's book _Morphismes et Categories_?
I haven't yet, but will, and I wondered if anyone had an opinion
on it.  (It is not clear to me from the listing how much of it
is by Piaget.)

Subject: Workshop on Foundational Methods in Computer Science
Date: Sat, 10 Apr 93 10:21 PDT
From: hook@hood.cse.ogi.edu (Jim Hook)

Preliminary Announcement:  

	Second Annual Workshop on 
	Foundational Methods in Computer Science
	A workshop on applications of categories
		in computer science

Dates:  June 4-6, 1993

Location:  Reed College, Portland, Oregon

Overview:
This will be the second year of the workshop on foundational methods
in computer science.  It is an "informal, even casual," workshop
bringing together mathematicians and computer scientists with an
interest in category theory and its applications to computer science.

The workshop will have approximately the same format as last year,
with a one day tutorial on June 4 and short research presentations on
June 5 and 6.  There will not be a formal proceedings.  

Guests:
I am still in the process of contacting distinguished visitors and
guests.  Tutorials will be presented by Ernie Manes, Robin Cockett and
David Benson (there may be others as well).  

Participation: 
People wishing to participate should send me email.  We hope to
encourage the participation of researchers at all levels in this
workshop.

Fees: 
I have made arrangements for dormitory accommodations and classroom
space.  I haven't negotiated the meal plan yet and I haven't completed
a budget, so I don't yet have a registration fee calculated.  I hope
to keep the fees to an absolute minimum.

Bizarre!  No, I haven't seen nor heard of it.  

I spoke with Aczel, who gave a talk at the recent meeting in New Orleans
I was at.  He has toned down his claims for NWF sets quite a bit and now
only claims that they are useful for intuition.  He does prefer to talk
of sets and classes, where I might prefer an inaccessible, but that is
perfectly harmless as far as I am concerned.

Abstract

If a category B with Yoneda embedding Y : B ---> CAT(B^op,set) 
has an adjoint string, U -| V -| W -| X -| Y, then B is equivalent to set.

\item[p. 236] (Frank Piessens).  The statement, ``It would be incorrect
to assume in general (although it is true in familiar examples) that
every node of $\Tsc$ is a limit of a diagram in the graph of $\Ssc$'' is
wrong.  The reason is that $\Tsc\op$ is a full subcategory of the
category $\Fun(\Ssc,\Set)$ (to be precise, that should be the free
category generated by the graph underlying $\Ssc$) and every functor is
a colimit of representables and, hence, in $\Tsc$, every functor is a
limit of them.  Thus every object of the theory is a limit of a diagram
built from the objects and arrows of $\Ssc$.
 
\item[p. 387] (Nico Verwer).  The solution to Exercise 4 of 8.3 contains
several errors. The right hand label of the diagram should be $<f,g>$,
the lower left corner of the diagram should be $B$ and the $f\x g$ in
the displayed line that begins $G(X)=\ldots$ should also be $<f,g>$.

The following paper preprint is available for anonymous
FTP from ftp.mpce.mq.edu.au (137.111.216.12) in

ABSTRACT:

The concept of regular category has several 2-dimensional analogues
depending upon which special arrows are chosen to mimic monics. Here,
the choice of the conservative arrows, leads to our notion of
faithfully conservative bicategory K in which two-sided discrete
fibrations become the arrows of a bicategory F=DFib(K). While the
homcategories F(B,A) have finite limits, it is important to have
conditions under which these finite ``local'' limits are preserved by
composition (on either side) with arrows of F. In other words, when
are all fibrations in K flat? Novel axioms on K are provided for this,
and we call a bicategory H modulated when H^op is such a K. Thus, we
have {\bf constructed} a proarrow equipment ()_*:H-->M (in the sense
of Wood) with M=F^coop.  Moreover, M is locally finitely cocomplete
and certain collages exist.

In the converse direction, if M is any locally countably cocomplete
bicategory which admits finite collages, then the bicategory M^* of
maps in M is modulated. {Recall that a 1-cell in a bicategory is
called a {\it map\/} when it has a right adjoint.}

  Categorical combinators, Sequential algorithms and Functional  

  programming, by P.-L. Curien

just appeared in the series Progress in Theoretical Computer Science,
Birkhauser.

I enclose the contents of the back cover, the table of contents, and
the preface to the second edition, to give an idea of the contents and
of the improvements with respect to the first edition.  Order and
price info are given at the end.

BACK COVER

This book is a thoroughly revised edition of a monograph that  appeared
under the same title in 1986 in the Series Research Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science, Pitman.  It presents an approach to the
design and implementation of sequential programming languages based  on
the relationship between lambda-calculus and category theory.

The foundations of a new "categorical" combinatory logic are laid
down. Compilation and evaluation techniques are investigated. A  simple
abstract machine, called the Categorical Abstract Machine, is
presented: it has served as the core of the implementation of the
language CAML, of the ML family, developped at INRIA-Roquencourt and
Ecole Normale Supe'rieure, and first released in 1987.  The main
characteristics of this approach are conceptual simplicity and
compacity, with bearings on portability, efficiency, and correctness
proofs.

A mathematical semantics of sequentiality is proposed, in which
"sequential algorithms" rather than functions are used to interpret
procedures. The theoretical investigation has led to the development
of a programming language, {bold CDS0}, in which basic and functional
types are not differentiated. The evaluation framework is a
demand-driven data flow network. The model of sequential algorithms is
fully abstract with respect to this language: two procedures have the
same denotation if and only if they have the same behaviour.
Background on full abstraction is given.

The new edition covers new results, and introduces new connections, as
suggested by the following non exhaustive list of keywords:  confluence
properties of categorical combinators, explicit substitutions,  control
operations, linear logic, geometry of interaction, strong stability.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
  


This book is a revised edition of the monograph which appeared under  

the same title in the series Research Notes in Theoretical Computer  

Science, Pitman, in 1986. In addition to a general effort to improve  

typography, English, and presentation, the main novelty of this  

second edition is the integration of some new material. Part of it is  

mine (mostly jointly with coauthors). Here is brief guide to these  

additions.

- I have augmented the account of categorical combinatory logic with  

a description of the confluence properties of rewriting systems of  

categorical combinators (Hardin, Yokouchi), and of the newly  

developed calculi of explicit substitutions (Abadi, Cardelli, Curien,  

Hardin, Le'vy, and Rios), which are similar in spirit to the  

categorical combinatory logic, but are closer to the syntax of  

%lbd%-calculus (Section 1.2). 


- The study of the full abstraction problem for PCF and extensions of  

it has been enriched with a new full abstraction result: the model of  

sequential algorithms is fully abstract with respect to an extension  

of PCF with a control operator (Cartwright, Felleisen, Curien). An  

order-extensional model of error-sensitive sequential algorithms is  

also fully abstract for a corresponding extension of PCF with a  

control operator and errors (Sections 2.6 and 4.1).

- I suggest that sequential algorithms lend themselves to a  

decomposition of the function spaces that leads to models of linear  

logic (Lamarche, Curien), and that connects sequentiality with games  

(Joyal, Blass, Abramsky) (Sections 2.1 and 2.6).

- There is even more to the connection with linear logic:
the operational semantics of sequential algorithms, formalized in  

Chapter 3, bears striking similarities with the geometry of  

interaction, developed for linear logic by Girard in 1988. In Section  

3.4, I have included a prologue and a picture to help conveying this  

conceptual similarity.

- I include a short description of some results of Bucciarelli and  

Ehrhard, who have proposed a more abstract theory of sequential  

algorithms (Section 2.4), an extensional (but not order-extensional)  

notion of strong stability, that is closed under exponentiation and  

coincides with sequentiality at first order
(Section 2.6), and a method of order-extensional embedding (Section  

4.4).

- These results are reported mostly in the form of exercises. I have  

decorated some exercises with a star to stress that their solution  

represents a significant work. The reader can use them as a quick  

reference to the source papers.

Here are a few other new works that I account for:

- adaptations of abstract environment machines to carry out full  

normalization of %lbd%-terms (Cre'gut, Asperti, Curien) (Section  

1.2);

- a hierarchical coherence theorem whose proof by Lafont gives as a  

side-effect a proof of termination of the execution of simply typed  

terms by the categorical abstract machine (Section 1.3);

- the inability of graph reduction of categorical combinators to  

implement optimal sharing of reductions (Curien, Field, Le'vy)  

(Section 1.7);

- further results on representation theorems for event domains, and  

solutions of domain equations (Droste) (Sections 2.2 and 2.3);
 


- the striking connection between (extensional) sequential algorithms  

and the oracle semantics of higher-order recursion theory developed  

by Kleene in the last years of his scientific career (Section 2.7);

- the works of Brookes and Geva on various approaches to intensional  

continuous semantics (Section 2.7);

- the use of logical relations to obtain a full abstraction result  

for order up to 3 (Sieber) (Sections 4.1 and 4.2).

Subject: Categories of relational structures
Date:        Fri, 30 Apr 93 20:31:14 ADT
From: Vaughan Pratt <pratt@CS.Stanford.EDU>

Define a relational structure (A,R) to consist of a set A and a n-ary
relation on A for some ordinal n.  A homomorphism f:(A,R)->(B,S) is a
function f:A->B between the underlying sets of two relational
structures of the same arity, such that f(R) c S.  Write Str_n for the
category of all n-ary relational structures and homomorphisms between
them, and Str for the sum in CAT of Str_n over all ordinals n.

1.  What is the term for the notion of full subcategory of either Str_n
or Str?  Failing that, what would be a suitable term?  Relational
categories?  Categories of relational structures?

Familiar examples of such categories and an upper bound on their
arities include those of groups (3), rings (4), fields (4), lattices
(3), vector spaces over the field K (1+max(|K|,2)), directed graphs
(2), posets (2), and categories (3).

I would expect complete lattices, complete Boolean algebras,
topological spaces, and hypergraphs not to embed in Str_n for any n,
because their structural elements (subsets, e.g. open sets) have no
fixed cardinality bound, unlike n-tuples.  A pointer to a proof of such
nonembedding, or a demonstration of how to embed them, would be greatly
appreciated.  Since the concept is such a natural one, this question
must surely have been looked at before.

2.  What generalizations of Str or Str_n have been considered?

One can make Str a bit more "communicative" by permitting homomorphisms
between dissimilar structures (A,R), (B,S) of respective arities m<n.
Do this by padding out (A,R) to arity n by defining R›(n) to be the set
of n-tuples of A whose first m elements satisfy R.  This probably looks
about as useful today as the telephone did in 1879.
