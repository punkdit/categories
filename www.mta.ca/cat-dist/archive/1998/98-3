In studying Algol-like languages, I repeatedly run into operators that
have an interesting structure.  I am wondering if such operators are
studied somewhere.

Consider a monoid <M,*,1> in a CCC.  The operations of interest are
natural transformations E_A : [A => M] -> M that satisfy the following
equations (in the internal language of the CCC):

    E_A(\lambda x. 1)  =  1
    E_A(\lambda x. a * g`x) = a * E_A(g)
    E_A(\lambda x. g`x * a) = E_A(g) * a
    E_A(\lambda x. E_B(\lambda y. h`x`y)) = 
			E_B(\lambda y. E_A(\lambda x. h`x`y))

These operators "feel" like existential quantifiers.  In fact, if M is
a subobject classifier with the monoid structure ofh conjunction, then
the existential quantifier E satisfies all of these equations (though
it is not a natural transformation).

In the applications I am interested in, M is a type of commands, with
* as sequential composition and 1 as the null action.  An example of
E is a local variable declaration.  

Is there some algebra or theory related to these kinds of operators?

Cheers,
Uday Reddy

 > 			E_B(\lambda y. E_A(\lambda x. h`x`y))

The naturality of E_A in A seems to be a very strong requirement
(provided that am not misuncerstanding anything, ofcourse).

Let T the terminal object (since 1 already denotes the unit of
M). Equations (1) and (2) imply

	E_T(\lambda x. a) = a, 

so E_T is iso. The naturality, on the other hand, implies that for
every a,b : T --> A holds

	a=>M ; E_T   =   E_A   =   b=>M ; E_T

Such E_A, I think, shouldn't be thought of as a quantifier: modulo
E_T, it actually boils down to the *evaluation* at (ie substitution
of) an arbitrary global point of A:

	E_A(g)  = g`a = g`b

Instanciating A = M and g = \lambda x. x yields a = 1, ie 1: T --> M
is the only global point of M. If T generates, M is T.

On the other hand, if there is an initial object 0 in the CCC, the
naturality in A implies that all E_A are constantly 1...

Without the naturality, conditions (1--4) seem to be rather easy to
satisfy. For a fixed A, conditions (2) and (3) are a kind of
naturality on E_A itself. To make this precise, define on A=>M the
pointwise monoid structure

	g * h   =  \lambda x. g`x * h`x
	
Thinking of M and A=>M as categories, each with one object *, we have
the Hom-functors from M^op x M and from A=>M^op x A=>M to the CCC
where they live.

On the other hand, there is the monoid morphism

	I : M ---> A=>M
	      m |--> \lambda x. m

which can be construed as a functor. Precomposing Hom_{A=>M} with I^op
and I, we get a functor from M^op x M. Conditions (2) and (3) are now
exactly the naturality of

	E_A : Hom_{A=>M} (I*, I*) ---> Hom_M (*,*)

in each of the arguments. Hom_M thus appears as a retract of the
functor Hom_{A=>M} o (I^op x I)... All together, E_A thus appear as a
weak kind of *abstraction operators* (like in
www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/duskop/papers/CLNA.ps.gz).

All this may not be enlightening at all, but it does seem to help pin
down the models: eg, evaluations/substitutions of the arbitrary points
will work again, as well as, when M is a complete lattice, the infima
and the suprema, corresponding to the quantifiers... (No naturality in
A, ofcourse.)

Apologies if I got carried away a bit. It's a nice question. I hope
others will tell more.

Uday Reddy poses the following (with a few changes in notation]:

>    E_A(\x. E_B(\y.hxy))  =  E_B(\y. E_A(\x.hxy))

I wonder if naturality is really desired: it would seem to force  M  to
be trivial. By the familiar Yoneda-lemma argument, E  must be constant
as far as the "points" of  [A,M]  are concerned. (Actually one doesn't
need the argument, just the lemma itself; consider the transformation
that  E  induces between set-valued functors  (-,M) -> (1,M); Yoneda
says it must be constant.) The condition

    E_A(\x.e)  =  e

forces just which constant it is. That is, for any  f:A -> M  it will
be the case that  E_A  will send  f  to  e.

But then either condition

    E_A(\x. a * gx) = a * E_A(g)

or

    E_A(\x. gx * a) = E_A(g) * a

will force  M  to be trivial. (It's clear in the \-calculus notation.
But that argument would be implicitly using the fact that  E_A  is
constant and we officially know only that it's constant on points.
So take, say, the second condition. It says in diagrammatic language:


              1 x K                 P            [A,*]
   [A,M] x M  -----> [A,M] x [A,M] ---> [A,MxM]  -----> [A,M]

         |                                                |
         |  E_A x 1_M                                     |  E_A
         |                                                |
                                    *
       M x M   ---------------------------------------->  M


where  K  is the standard "constant-map" operator that's adjoint to
the projection  AxM -> M  and  P  is the standard operator that
defines  MxM  (given products in Set). Specialize to  A = M  and
precompose with  <f,1>: M -> [M,M] x M  where  f  doesn't matter. If
the commutative rectangle above is chased clockwise one obtains the
map constantly valued  e. Chased counterclockwise one obtains the
identity map. And, of course, it didn't matter what  f  is.)

Indeed!  (Peter Johnstone and Dusko Pavlovic also pointed out that I
went wrong in asking for naturality.)  Something got lost in
abstracting from my application domain.  My examples had additional
parameters which made naturality possible.  But, discarding those
parameters in the interest of abstration seems to have produced a
statement that is quite impossible to satisfy.  My apologies.

Dusko Pavlovic pointed out some of what we could do once we discard
the naturality condition.  The second and third equations can be
regarded as naturality properties by thinking of M and [A,M] as
categories and E_A as a functor.  (That is good, because it singles
out the first equation as a "pretender."  So, I shouldn't be worried
when it breaks.)

On the other hand, I don't know what to make of the fourth equation.
It says that for E_A to be an abstraction operator (tentatively using
Pavlovic's terminoloty), it has to commute with every other
abstraction operator E_B.  For one, that prevents me from giving a
local definition of what an abstraction operator is.  One needs to
define the whole collection of abstraction operators at one go.  (Now
that naturality is gone out the window, there is no reason to require
even that the family of operators be indexed by objects.  There could
be any number of maps for an object A.)  Secondly, looking at it from
the application point of view, there is something "intrinsic" about
these operators that makes them commute with each other.  It is not
really a property of the whole collection of operators.  The presence
or absence of another operator in the collection shouldn't matter.  I
really have no idea how to capture this kind of "uniformity" in the
commutativity property.  Some hyperdoctrine-like idea, perhaps?

Despite the fact the first equation doesn't hold in all toposes, I
think the example of the existential quantifier is an illuminating
one.  Evaluation at a particular point is a "degenerate" example in
that it also satisfies

      E_A(\x. fx * gx) = E_A(f) * E_A(g)

The existential quantifier gives a better intuition for the idea of
these operators.

Hope this explains the question better.

Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk
Status: RO
X-Status: 

When reading the last message of Uday Reddy,
I got three ideas.

1) Several people have pointed out that naturality is impossible.
Yet a weaker form of naturality may be appropriate.
Consider existential quantification on sets.
If f: A -> B is a function and p: B -> M (= Bool) a predicate,
then  exists x in A: p(fx)  iff  exists x in f(A): p x
This suggests to require naturality  E_A (p o f) = E_B p
for *epis*  f: A -> B  only.

2)  Uday Reddy asked about the significance of the third equation:
    E_A(\x. E_B(\y.hxy))  =  E_B(\y. E_A(\x.hxy))
This equation looks a bit like the Foubini theorem
in integration theory.
The difference is that in Foubini's theorem,
there is a third mediating term, whose analogue would be
    E_(A x B) (\(x,y). hxy) .
[Distinguish the product symbol x in A x B from the variable x.]

3) The analogy with integration also shows that
something may be missing from the present setting:
The integral depends on the function to be integrated
and also on a measure.  It is in fact an operator
    I_A: [A->M] x M(A) -> M
where M are the (non-negative?) reals
with the multiplicative monoid structure,
and M(A) is the set of measures on A.
[Distinguish the operator M from the monoid M.
 Yet there is some connection: M(1) = M
 if M is taken to consist of the non-negative reals.]

Now, we get
         I_A(\x. a * gx, m)  =  a * I_A(g, m)
         I_A(\x. gx * a, m)  =  I_A(g, m) * a
by linearity of integration, and
         I_A(\x.1, m) = m(A)
(= 1, if only normalised measures are considered, but then M = M(1) is lost)
Of course, integration has many more properties, e.g.
additivity in the function, and linearity in m.

The last equation becomes
  I_A (\x. I_B (\y. hxy, mb), ma) = I_B (\y. I_A (\x. hxy, ma), mb)
  =  I_(A x B) (\(x,y). hxy, ma x mb)   with the product measure ma x mb.

There is also kind of naturality, namely the law of substitution:
For  f: A -> B,  I_A (p o f, ma) = I_B (p, ma o f^-1)
	(for  p: B -> M  and  ma in M(A) ).
This becomes a bit more categorical
by noting that  M(-)  is a functor  with  M(f) (ma) = ma o f^-1
and so   I_A ( [f->] p, ma) = I_B (p, M(f) ma) .

Much of this can be formulated abstractly with a functor M.
For the mediating term of the Foubini theorem,
a natural transformation  x_AB: M(A) x M(B) -> M(AxB)  is needed
to form the product measure.

It may be useful to introduce a natural transformation
eta_A: A -> M(A), giving point measures.
    I_A (p, eta_A(x)) = p(x)  holds for p: A -> M  and  x in A.

The transformation x_AB induces a binary operation on  M(1) = M(1 x 1),
and for  1 = {()},  eta_1 ()  is an element of  M(1).
This gives a monoid structure on M(1),
giving back the original monoid M.

Back to existential quantification:
===================================
Take  M(A) = P(A), the powerset of A,  and M = P(1) = Bool
and define  E_A (p, S) = exists x in S: p(x)
for  p: A -> M  and  S in P(A).
Then all the equations for integration hold
(with  x_AB : P(A) x P(B) -> P(A x B)  being cartesian product
 and  eta_A(x) = {x} )

Instead of considering  E_A: [A->M] x P(A) -> M,
one may, using CC, also consider  E'_A: P(A) -> [[A->M]->M] .
This is even a monad homomorphism from the power set monad
to the monad  [[- -> M] -> M]  (known as continuation monad
with "final answers" M).

A similar thing is possible in the category of domains,
with P being some power domain construction
(see my paper  "Power Domains and Second Order Predicates",
 TCS 111, 59 - 88 (1993) ).

Maybe, this is the essence of Uday's work:
defining a monad homomorphism from some monad used
in the semantic description of a language to the continuation monad.

Dear Category Theorists,

Please find enclosed a copy of the TRAILER for a new version of Xy-pic!

Sincerely,
           Kristoffer H. Rose

=======================================================================
    ANNOUNCING the Xy-pic version 3.6 DIAGRAM TYPESETTING PACKAGE
=======================================================================

This is to announce a release of my diagram typesetting package Xy-pic.

Version 3.6 contains new and improved PostScript fonts donated by Y&Y
Inc. (as well as several minor bug fixes).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				GENERAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting a variety of graphs and diagrams
with TeX.  Xy-pic works with most formats (including LaTeX, AMS-LaTeX,
AMS-TeX, and plain TeX), in particular Xy-pic is provided as a LaTeX2e
`supported package' (following the `CTAN LaTeX2e bundle' standard).

Further specifics of the package are in the distribution README file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
				 NEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary purpose of release 3.6 is the inclusion of much improved
PostSript fonts courtesy of Y&Y TeX and several Internetwide
volunteers: these make it possible to use Xy-pic output with Windows
(in addition to Macintosh and Un*x), Adobe's ATM software, and to
produce Adobe PDF ("Acrobat") files.

NOTE: This change means that you must REMOVE SOME OLD FONT FILES (the
details of which and how are in the INSTALL file).

Release 3.6 furthermore fixes a few problems of release 3.5:

* frames more robust against disappearing on bogus PostScript printers
* thickness of curves now adjustable
* TDS compliance improved
* bogus `graph escape redefined' message eliminated

Thanks to David Carlisle, John Landamore, Ralph Loader, Thorsten
Schwander, and Timco Visser, for your bug reports, and to Adam
Worrall, Thierry Bouche, Tanmoy Bhattacharya and especially to
Berthold Horn and Louis Vosloo of Y&Y Inc. for their work on the
PostScript fonts.

Finally profound thanks to BRICS and DAIMI for hosting Xy-pic (and
Kristoffer :) for a most productive and enjoyable year!

			   HISTORY & CREDITS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first public release (version 1.40) of Xy-pic was created by
Kristoffer H. Rose, DIKU, U of Copenhagen (now ENS-Lyon, France) and
distributed via Usenet on December 19, 1991.  This quickly became
version 2 of which version 2.6 was the most stable.

The thorough rewrite that became version 3 is a continued
collaboration with Ross Moore, Macquarie U, Sydney, initiated through
a visit to Macquarie (Jan-May 1994 supported by the Australian
Research Council, Macquarie University, and using donated DEC
equipment).  However, full backwards compatibility is maintained
(except for the unavoidable but fully documented obscure cases).

                            MPC '98

               Fourth International Conference on

               MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
               -----------------------------------

             http://www.md.chalmers.se/Conf/MPC98/

                      June 15 - 17, 1998

                       Marstrand, Sweden



                    Post-conference workshops:

        * Workshop on Generic Programming, WGP'98
          http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/conf/wgp/

        * International Workshop on Constructive Methods for
          Parallel Programming, CMPP'98
          http://brahms.fmi.uni-passau.de/cl/cmpp98/index.html

        * Formal Techniques for Hardware and Hardware-like
          Systems, FTH'98
          http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~ms/FTH98/


The general theme of this series of conferences is the use of crisp,
clear mathematics in the discovery and design of algorithms and in the
development of corresponding software or hardware. The conference
theme reflects the growing interest in formal, mathematically based
methods for the construction of software and hardware. The goal of the
MPC conferences is to report on and significantly advance the state of
the art in this area. Previous conferences were held in 1989 at
Twente, The Netherlands, organised by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, in
1992 at Oxford, United Kingdom, and in 1995 at Kloster Irsee, Germany,
organised by Augsburg University.

Invited speakers:
  
  Burghard von Karger (Kiel University)
  John Hughes (Chalmers Technical University)
  David Harel (Weizmann Institute)

                             VENUE

Marstrand is a small island on the beautiful westcoast of Sweden, 40
km from Göteborg. The charming old houses, the fortress, the walking
paths, and the absence of cars make this island a very pleasant
resort. There are direct flights to Göteborg Landvetter from most
European main cities, and busses from Göteborg to Marstrand.

At our institute (Informatica-UFRGS, Brazil) there is a group starting to develop
a collection of on-line resources to help  teaching the Category Theory.

Now I am looking for similar work around the world. We are specially
interested in exercices and other similar resources available in the net.

Could someone give me some links?

Thanks in advance,

A natural transformation is an indexed family of arrows such that a
certain diagram commutes. One could require a stronger condition,
namely that the said diagram is a pullback. What would such a
transformation be called? I'm sure I've seen this in the literature
before but I cant remember where. Pointers?

This problem arose in the context of finitary monads where 
T(X) is the derived operations over a set X for some signature. 
The naturality square for the unit turns out to be a pullback. 
This then implies that the unit of the monad is a monic - 
presumably this is a result in the literature somewhere. 
Again, pointers?

                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                 Workshop on Internet Programming Languages

               in conjunction with the IEEE Computer Society 
            International Conference on Computer Languages 1998
                       Loyola University Chicago
                             Chicago, USA
                    http://www.math.luc.edu/iccl98

                            May 13, 1998

The Internet has long provided a global computing infrastructure but, for most 
of its history, there has not been much interest in programming languages 
tailored specifically to that infrastructure. More recently, the Web has 
produced a widespread interest in global resources and, as a consequence, in 
global programmability. It is now commonplace to discuss how programs can be 
made to run effectively and securely over the Internet.

This workshop will provide a forum for the discussions of all aspects of 
computer languages for wide-area systems, including specification languages, 
programming languages, semantics, implementation technologies, and application 
experience.

In response to the question of Neil Ghani, namely
	
	
	A natural transformation is an indexed family of arrows such that a
	certain diagram commutes. One could require a stronger condition,
	namely that the said diagram is a pullback. What would such a
	transformation be called? I'm sure I've seen this in the literature
	before but I cant remember where. Pointers?
	
	This problem arose in the context of finitary monads where 
	T(X) is the derived operations over a set X for some signature. 
	The naturality square for the unit turns out to be a pullback. 
	This then implies that the unit of the monad is a monic - 
	presumably this is a result in the literature somewhere. 
	Again, pointers?
	
	Neil Ghani
	
	

this phenomenon is now quite well recognised. some call such natural
transformations "cartesian", while others use Robin Cockett's term "shapely".
For my own contribution to the subject, see [G.M. Kelly, On clubs and 
data-type constructors, in applications of Categories to Computer Science
(Proc. LMS Symposium, Durham 1991), Cambridge Univ. Press 1992, 163-190].

Natural transformations for which the naturality square is a pullback
are commonly called cartesian: it's not an ideal name for them, but
it's quite well established. For the question of when the unit and
multiplication of a monad on Sets are cartesian, see section 3 of
"Connected limits, familial representability and Artin glueing"
by A. Carboni and P.T. Johnstone (Math. Struct. Comp. Sci. 5 (1995),

This is in response to John Baez' query:

Where can I read about the "tensor product" of cocomplete categories?
(Hopefully this is a sensible and self-explanatory concept.)
Or variations on this theme involving categories with coproducts,
or finite colimits, or finite coproducts? 

I can think of three things of mine in print which are relevant:

\item"{[35]}" (with F. Foltz and C. Lair) Algebraic categories with few
monoidal biclosed structures or none, {\it Jour. Pure and Applied Alg.} 17
(1980), 171-177.

(the last section or so of)
\item"{[41]}" Structures defined by finite limits in the enriched context I,
 {\it Cahiers de Top. et G\'eom. Diff.} 23 (1982), 3-42.


\item"{[52]}" (with G.B. Im) A universal property of the convolution monoidal
structure, {\it J. Pure Appl. Algebra} 43 (1986), 75-88. 

Much of this kind of thing is folklore; when one uses "left adjoint" rather
than "cocontinuous", some speak of considering "objects in two categories" -
see the first paper above.

		Call for Papers

            Seventh International AMAST Conference
     AMAST '98,  January 5 to 9 , 1999,  Amazonia, Brazil.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals

The major goal of the  AMAST  Conferences  is  to  put  software
development  technology  on  a  firm,  mathematical foundation.
Particular emphasis is given to algebraic and logical foundations
of software technology.  An eventual goal is to establish algebraic
and logical methodologies as viable and attractive approaches to
software engineering.

The first three editions of AMAST were held at the University of Iowa
(1989 and 1991) and at the University of Twente (1993). The fourth
conference was held at  Concordia University of Montreal (1995), the
fifth at Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich (1996), and the sixth
will be held in Sidney, Australia, (December 13-17, 1997).
During these meetings, AMAST has attracted an international following
among researchers and practitioners interested in software technology,
programming methodology and their algebraic and logical foundations.
In addition, the first day of each conference has been dedicated to
Mathematics Education for Software Engineers.

Following this successful trend, the seventh AMAST International
Conference will be held in Amazonia, Brazil, from January 5 to
January 9, 1999.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions

As in the previous years we invite papers reporting original research
in algebra, logic and other formalisms suitable as a foundation for
software technology, as well as software technologies developed by means
of logic and algebraic methodologies. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:


SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
        systems software technology,
        application software technology,
        concurrent and reactive systems,
        formal methods in industrial software development,
        formal techniques for software requirements, design.

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY
        logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms,
        constraint programming and concurrency,
        program verification and transformation,
        programming calculi,
        specification languages and tools,
        formal specification and development case studies.

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
        logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra,
        algebraic foundations for languages and systems,
        theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning,
        logics of programs.

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers)
        software development environments,
        support for correct software development,
        system support for reuse,
        tools for prototyping,
        validation and verification,
        computer algebra systems,
        theorem proving systems.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality.  Papers should be between five
and fifteen pages in LNCS style.  Ten page papers are ideal, and
papers longer than fifteen pages may be rejected without detailed
refereeing.  Please see details at

                                http://www.lmf-di.puc-rio.br/~amast98

under "submission" which explain how to obtain a paper number, and
then how to send a fully self-contained postscript file (preferably
derived from LaTeX with the LNCS style) to
amast98@lmf-di.puc-rio.br.  If for any reason it is impossible
to submit a paper electronically, authors should send six paper copies of their
submission to the programme chair at the address below.

All papers will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance
to the conference. As in the past, we expect the proceedings to
be published by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer
Science Series.  Papers should be received by June 15, 1998.

The TLCA series of
conferences aims at providing a forum for
the presentation and discussion of recent
research in an area which was originally a rather restricted field  
but has now considerably expanded. The following list of topics is  
non-limitative:\\ 

\vspace{-0.4cm}
