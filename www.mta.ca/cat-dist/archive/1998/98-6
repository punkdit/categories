Calculemus and Types 98 / User Interfaces for Theorem Provers 1998

Call for Participation and Final Programme


Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, 13-15th July 1998 
http://www.win.tue.nl/~calc




A few years ago, several groups from the deduction and computer
algebra communities decided to work together towards the integration
of theorem provers and computer algebra systems. This collaborative
project has been called Calculemus.  The Types project has operated in
much the same direction, but with a stronger focus on Lambda-Calculus.
Significant progress has now been achieved and it has been decided
that this workshop will be fully open and provide the atmosphere for
discussion among the two communities.  

The workshop will be held in parallel with the UITP workshop on the
analysis and design of user interfaces for theorem proving assistants.


For full details of the workshop, hotel reservation and the registration 
form consult:
     http://www.win.tue.nl/~calc
     http://www.win.tue.nl/cs/ipa/uitp/


Early registration and hotel reservation is strongly recommended
since the number of delegates we can accommodate is limited.


Presentations in the first column of the programme are part of the
UITP workshop, presentations in the second column are Calculemus and
Types presentations. Presentations in the middle are joint.  Delegates
will be free to move between the two workshops.

		Structures in Higher-Dimensional Category Theory

This is an exposition of some of the constructions which have arisen in
higher-dimensional category theory. We start with a review of the general
theory of operads and multicategories. Using this we give an account of
Batanin's definition of n-category; we also give an informal definition in
pictures. Next we discuss Gray-categories and their place in coherence
problems. Finally, we present various constructions relevant to the opetopic
definitions of n-category.

New material includes a suggestion for a definition of lax cubical
n-category; a characterization of small Gray-categories as the small
substructures of 2-Cat; a conjecture on coherence theorems in higher
dimensions; a construction of the category of trees and, more generally, of
n-pasting diagrams; and an analogue of the Baez-Dolan slicing process in the
general theory of operads.


(A few corrections have been made to the version of this distributed at the
PSSL in Utrecht, and these are listed at the web site.)

CONCUR 98: Purpose and Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory
of concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this
topic is continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance
 of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

The scope of CONCUR'98 covers all areas of semantics, logics, and
verification techniques for concurrent systems.  A list of specific
topics includes (but is not limited to) concurrency related aspects of
models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems
and algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming
and verification.



Venue and local arrangements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nice is ideally located on the French Riviera. September is still very
pleasant, while less crowded than the high season. Nice's
international airport is well-connected to all major european and
non-european cities.

The conference will be held at the auditorium of Nice
Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, which is conveniently located
in the heart of Nice, between the city center and the old town, and 20
minutes walk to the beach. The Museum is next to the Hotel Novotel,
where tutorials, satellite workshops, and registration will be held.

``On branched covers in topos theory''

Abstract: We present some new findings conerning branched covers in 
topos theory. Our discussion involves a particular subtopos of a 
given topos that can be described as the smallest subtopos closed 
under small coproducts in the including topos.  We also have some new 
results concerning the general theory of KZ-doctrines, such as the 
the closure under composition of discrete fibrations for a KZ-
doctrine (in the sense of Bunge/Funk, ``On a bicomma object condition 
for KZ-doctrines'').

		      Call for Papers

            Seventh International Conference on
       Algebraic Methodology and Software Technology
     AMAST '98,  January 5 to 9 , 1999,  Amazonia, Brazil.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals

The major goal of the  AMAST  Conferences  is  to  put  software
development  technology  on  a  firm,  mathematical foundation.
Particular emphasis is given to algebraic and logical foundations
of software technology.  An eventual goal is to establish algebraic
and logical methodologies as viable and attractive approaches to
software engineering.

The first three editions of AMAST were held at the University of Iowa
(1989 and 1991) and at the University of Twente (1993). The fourth
conference was held at  Concordia University of Montreal (1995), the
fifth at Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich (1996), and the sixth
was held in Sidney, Australia, (December 13-17, 1997).
During these meetings, AMAST has attracted an international following
among researchers and practitioners interested in software technology,
programming methodology and their algebraic and logical foundations.
In addition, the first day of each conference has been dedicated to
Mathematics Education for Software Engineers.

Following this successful trend, the seventh AMAST International
Conference will be held in Amazonia, Brazil, from January 5 to
January 9, 1999.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions

As in the previous years we invite papers reporting original research
in algebra, logic and other formalisms suitable as a foundation for
software technology, as well as software technologies developed by means
of logic and algebraic methodologies. Submissions should not have been
published and should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:


SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
        systems software technology,
        application software technology,
        concurrent and reactive systems,
        formal methods in industrial software development,
        formal techniques for software requirements, design.

PROGRAMMING METHODOLOGY
        logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms,
        constraint programming and concurrency,
        program verification and transformation,
        programming calculi,
        specification languages and tools,
        formal specification and development case studies.

ALGEBRAIC AND LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
        logic, category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra,
        algebraic foundations for languages and systems,
        theorem proving and logical frameworks for reasoning,
        logics of programs.

SYSTEMS AND TOOLS (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers)
        software development environments,
        support for correct software development,
        system support for reuse,
        tools for prototyping,
        validation and verification,
        computer algebra systems,
        theorem proving systems.

We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously
unpublished papers of high quality.  Papers should be between five
and fifteen pages in LNCS style.  Ten page papers are ideal, and
papers longer than fifteen pages may be rejected without detailed
refereeing.  Please send a fully self-contained postscript file
(preferably derived from LaTeX with the LNCS style) to
amast98@lmf-di.puc-rio.br as well as to mfrias@inf.puc-rio.br.
If for any reason it is impossible to submit a paper electronically,
authors should send six paper copies of their submission to the
programme chair at the address below.

All papers will be refereed by the programme committee, and will be
judged based on their significance, technical merit, and relevance
to the conference. As in the past, we expect the proceedings to
be published by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer
Science Series.  Papers should be received by June 15, 1998.

  The Editor of the AMS Notices, Tony Knapp, has kindly given me
  permission to post my part of Sammy's memorial collection. I trust
  that it's clear that it shouldn't be forwarded to any other list.
  For historical reasons (I guess) I've restored a number of
  paragraphs that were deleted from the final version -- they are
  marked with a | running down the left margin. And I've added a few
  footnotes. Let me take the opportunity to mention that Tony's
  editorial services were greatly appreciated, in particular, he
  caught a number of places where my original ms would have been much
  misunderstood.


  Thirty years ago I found myself a neighbor of Arthur Upham Pope, the
master of ancient Persian art. He had retired in his 90s to an estate
in the center of the city of Shiraz in southern Iran where I lived --
briefly -- across the street. I found an excuse for what has to be
called an audience and I mentioned that I was a friend of Samuel
Eilenberg.

  ``I don't know him.'' he said, ``I know _of_ him, of course. How do
you know him?''

  ``We work in the same area of mathematics.''

  ``You're talking about a different Eilenberg. I meant the dealer in
Indian art.''

  ``Actually, it's the same person. He's both a mathematician and a
collector of Indian art.''

  ``Don't be silly, young man. The Eilenberg I mean is not a
_collector_ of Indian art, he's the _dealer_ in Indian art. I know him
well. He established the historicity of one of the Persian kings.[1]
He certainly is not a mathematician.''

  End of audience.

                               *  *  *

  In later years even Arthur Upham Pope would have known. Eilenberg
became universally known as ``Professor'' in the art world; indeed, if
one walked with him in London or Zurich or even Philadelphia and one
heard ``Professor!'' it was always Eilenberg who was being hailed and it
was always the art world hailing him.

  If you heard ``Sammy!'', you knew it was a mathematician. 

                               *  *  *

  It was complicated, explaining that name. If you were my age and
knew him first through his works, it was hard to conceive of him as
``Sammy''. And when you met him for the first time, it was even
harder. You already knew that he was in charge of entire fields of
mathematics -- indeed, he had created a number of them -- and when you
met him you knew that he was in charge of the room you were in and it
didn't matter whose room it was. Sammy? The name didn't fit.

  But he had to have a name like Sammy. I said it was hard to explain.
Here was one of the most aggressive people you would ever meet. He'd
challenge almost anything. If you mentioned something about the
weather he'd challenge you -- once in California I heard him insist
that it wasn't weather; it was climate. But somehow it was almost
always clear: you'd could challenge him right back. Aggressive and
challenging, but not at all pompous. You can't be pompous with a name
like Sammy.[2]

                               *  *  *

| Once a gang of us spent an evening in a bar in San Antonio, Texas,
| on the occasion of an annual AMS meeting. Most of us, except for
| Sammy, ranged in age from very young to thirtysomething. As usual,
| it was a series of pitched battles between Sammy and the rest of us,
| and before the evening was out, the bartender became part of the
| crowd. The next day I told him that Sammy was a world-famous
| mathematician and when he wouldn't believe it I asked him to go to
| anyone in his bar who looked like a mathematician and ask about
| Samuel Eilenberg. He still wouldn't believe it. I don't know if he
| would have believed the part about Indian art.

                               *  *  *

  Sammy kept his two worlds, mathematics and art, at something of a
distance. But both worlds seemed to agree on one thing, the very one
that Arthur Upham Pope insisted upon. Sammy was the dealer. But the
two worlds only seemed to agree on this.

  Without question, Sammy loved playing the role of dealer. In the
days when mathematicians were in demand and jobs were easy to come by,
Sammy loved to tell about the math market he was going to create. The
trade would be in mathematician futures: ``This one's only done two
lemmas and one proposition in the last year; the most recent theorem
was two years ago; better sell this one at a loss.'' With his big
cigar (expensive) and his big gold ring (in fact a valuable Indian
artifact) he could enter his dealer mode at a moment's notice and one
always wondered just how many young mathematicians' careers were in
his hands.

  But his two worlds, mathematics and art, perceived this role quite
differently. In mathematics we understood that it was a role he loved
playing, but that he was only playing. His being as a mathematician
was what counted and he would have been the same mathematician whether
or not he played the dealer, indeed, whether or not he played -- and
he did -- a high-stakes poker. This was not so clear in his other
world.

|   In 1981 Sammy was briefly my guest at St John's College, Cambridge,
| where I was, for the year, an Overseas Fellow. In due course, he was
| given a tour of the Asian collection at the Fitzwilliam Museum by 
| the appropriate functionary, and the two of them landed at high
| table for dinner. There seems to be a stock of stories about
| mathematicians not being appreciated at high tables, the best known
| being Heinz Hopf's (unwitting) success in convincing his fellow
| diners that he taught at a technical high school in Zurich. The
| Fitzwilliam functionary was treating Sammy as some sort of rich
| dealer who apparently taught mathematics on the side. Sammy went
| along. But then the doyen of the Cambridge philosophy community let
| it be known that he viewed Sammy as one of the two leading
| mathematicians in the world. Next came an American from Missouri
| who realized that Sammy was the same Eilenberg for whom a part of
| the local museum was named. It went on from there.[3]

                               *  *  *

  It was usually frustrating trying to explain to others how Sammy was
perceived by his fellow mathematicians. Sammy had an unprintable way
of saying that mathematics required both intelligence and
aggression.[4] But imagine not knowing how his mathematics -- when he
had finished -- would totally belie that aggression. Imagine not
knowing how remarkably well-behaved his mathematics always was.
Imagine not knowing how his mathematics -- when he had finished --
always seemed pre-ordained and how it seemed no more aggressive than,
say, the sun rising at its appointed sunrise time.

  Forty years ago Sammy hoped to do the same for Indian bronzes. He
had already acquired the reputation of being the best detector of fakes
in the business and he believed he could axiomatize the process. He
even had a provisional list of axioms and it was truly an elegant
list.

  A few years later we found ourselves at a small French-style bistro
in La Jolla, California. We had been out of touch: there had been an
argument about mathematical ethics and somehow we had resolved it; the
dinner was something of a celebration of the resolution. I asked him
about his book on bronzes.

  ``The axioms failed.''

  ``What does that mean?''

  ``It means that I've been taken. I bought a fake.''

  He had suspected it only after it had been in his bedroom for a few
weeks. He had the pleasure, at least, of investigating until he found
out the master faker and he had the pleasure of going to the master
faker's studio, not to berate hem but to congratulate him.

                               *  *  *

  After that, Sammy made a point of not building bridges between his
two worlds. I recall just one exception. He moved from a conversation
about sculpture to one about mathematics. Sculptors, he had said,
learn early to create from the inside out: what finally is to be seen
on the surface is the result of a lot of work in conceptualizing the
interior. But there are a few others: there are those for whom the
interior is the result of a lot of work on getting the surface
right. ``And,'' Sammy asked, ``isn't that the case for my
mathematics?''

  Style was only one part of his mathematics -- as, of course, he knew
-- but there are, indeed, wonderful stories about Sammy, by attending
only to what seemed the most superficial of stylistic choices,
succeeding in restructuring an entire subject on the spot.

  Many have witnessed this triumph of style over substance,
particularly with students. But the the most dramatic example had a
stellar cast.  D.C.Spencer gave a colloquium at Columbia in the Spring
of '62, and Sammy decided it was time to demonstrate his
get-rid-of-subscripts rule: ``If you define it right, you won't need a
subscript''. Spencer, with the greatest of charm -- it was for good
reason that he was already affectionately known as ``Uncle Don'' --
followed Sammy's orders and proceeded to restructure his subject while
standing there at the board. One by one, the subscripts disappeared,
each disappearance preceded by a Sammy-dictated redefinition. He had
virtually no idea of the intended meanings of any of the symbols. he
was operating entirely on the surface, looking only at the shape of
the syntax.

  The process went on for several minutes, until Sammy took on the one
proposition on the board. ``So now what does that say?''

  ``Sammy, I don't know. You're the one making all the definitions.''

  So Sammy applied his definitions and one by one the subscripts
continued to disappear, until finally the proposition itself
disappeared: it became the assertion that a thing was equal -- behold
-- to itself.

                               *  *  *

|   When he received an honorary doctorate in 1985, the University of
| Pennsylvania cited him as ``our greatest mathematical stylist''.[5]
| 
|                              *  *  *
| 
| On that occasion, Sammy was just a little put out that one of his
| fellow honorees seemed to be there for entirely political reasons.
| At the commencement eve banquet he got into one of his better moods
| and told the university president, ``When you choose your honorary
| degrees correctly it is the university that is honored; when you
| choose incorrectly it is they who are honored."  The next day the
| president -- not catching Sammy's subtext (fortunately, I guess) --
| incorporated these "inspiring words of Professor Eilenberg's'' into
| his commencement address. It wasn't easy to keep a straight face.

                               *  *  *

  ``My mother's father had the town brewery and he had one child, a
daughter. He went to the head of the town yeshiva and asked for the
best student.'' Sammy told me one day. ``So my future father became a
brewer instead of a rabbi.''

   Sammy regarded pre-war Poland with some affection. He felt that he
had been well nurtured by the Polish community of mathematicians and
he told me of his pleasure on being received by Stefan Banach,
himself, a process of being welcomed to the holy of holies, the cafe
in which Banach spent his time during the annual Polish mathematical
conferences. By the time he came to the U.S. in his mid 20s Sammy was
a well-known topologist.

  When I questioned him on his attitude about pre-war Poland, he
answered that one must ``watch the derivative'': don't judge just by how
good things are, but by how fast they're becoming better.[6]

  Sammy's view of Poland since the war was more complicated. It was
particularly complicated by what he viewed as its treatment of category
theory as a fringe subject.

                               *  *  *

  In the late 1950s, Sammy began to concentrate his mathematical
activities -- both research and dealing -- on category theory. He and
Mac Lane had invented the subject, but to them, it was always an
applied subject, not an end in itself. Categories were defined in
order to define functors, which, in turn, were defined in order to
define natural transformations, which were defined, finally, in order
to prove theorems that could not be proved before. In this view,
category theory belonged in the mainstream of mathematics.

  There was another view, the categories-as-fringe view. It said that
categories were defined in order to _state_ theorems that could not be
stated before, that they were not tools but objects of nature worthy
of study in their own right. Sammy believed this counter-view was a
direct interference with his role as the chief dealer for category
theory. He had watched many of his inventions become standard
mathematics -- singular homology, obstruction theory, homological
algebra -- and he had no intention of leaving the future of category
theory to others.

  Today the language of category theory has permeated a good part of
mathematics and is treated with some respect. It was not ever
so. There were years before the words "category" and "functor" could
be pronounced unapologetically in mixed mathematical company. One of
my fonder memories comes from sitting next to Sammy in the early 60s
when Frank Adams gave his first lectures on how every functor on
finite dimensional vector spaces gives rise to a natural
transformation on the K-functor. Frank used that construction to
obtain what are now called the Adams operations and he used those to
count how many independent vector fields there could be on a sphere.
It was not until then that it become permissible to say "functor"
without a little snort.

  In those years, Sammy was a one-man employment agency for a fresh
generation of mathematicians who viewed categories not just as a
language but as potentially central mathematical subject. For the
next 35 years he went to just about every category theory conference,
and much more important, he used his masterly expository skills to
convey categorical ideas to other mathematicians. Sammy's efforts
succeeded for the language of category theory and he never gave up
with his efforts for the theory itself. He was confident that the
categorical view would eventually be the standard mathematical view,
with or without his salesmanship. Its inevitability would be based on
the theorems whose proofs required it. That was obvious to Sammy. He
wanted to make it obvious to everyone else.



[1] Sammy published a paper showing that some gold coins he had were
    produced during the king's reign.

[2] In the final version the use of the 2nd person in the last three
    paragraphs was replaced with something more standard, as were the
    contractions.

[3] The dinner was actually at Kings, the functionary was the relevant
    curator, the philosopher was R.B.Braithwaite. I wasn't there --
    Sammy told me about it the next day and with great relish.

[4] What was found to be unprintable was already a bowdlerization: 

      Sammy liked to say that when you did mathematics you were using
      not just your brains but your guts. (Well, all right, it wasn't
      guts, but another plural body part far from the brain; I like to
      believe that Sammy would, in time, have agreed to my
      translation.)

    Dick Kadison tells me that in the very first utterance was in
    reply to a lunch-time question put by the physicist, Polykarp
    Kusch, "Sammy, what is it you use to do mathematics?" And in that
    very first utterance (as opposed to the way Sammy enjoyed saying
    it thereafter) the body-part in question was not plural but quite
    singular.

[5] This sentence will appear in Hy Bass's opening narrative vita for
    the Notices' memorial collection.

[6] A paragraph I used in an earlier draft as a bridge into the
    category material:

      Thus, in 1961 Sammy was one of the first American scientists to
      journey to Russia. A.G.Kurosch reciprocated with a visit to the
      U.S. and because the two visits ended up being at the same time,
      the two did not meet. Pity. We wondered would have time happened
      if Sammy had heard Kurosch's opening words at his colloquium
      lecture: ``We in Russia believe that category theory is destined
      to be as important as lattice theory.'' As it was, no one
      relished the task of repeating those words to Sammy.  Actually,
      now that I think about it, everybody looked forward to seeing
      Sammy's reaction when the words were repeated.

A Homology Theory for Etale Groupoids
       by Marius Crainic and Ieke Moerdijk

In this paper we introduce a homology theory for etale groupoids, dual to
Haefliger's cohomology theory (via Poincare duality).  We prove basic facts
like Morita invariance, Leray spectral sequence, Verdier duality. We also
outline the application to the computation of cyclic homology of the
convolution algebra of the groupoid (including the non-Hausdorff situation).
An appendix about "compact supports" on non-Hausdorff manifolds is added.

Dear categoricist,

Let I be the following small category : 

         a            a                   a
     -------->    -------->           -------->

     -------->    -------->           -------->
         b            b                   b

with the relations a o a = a o b and b o a = b o b.

Consider the category C of functors from I to the category of
K-modules.  How could we characterize the projective objects of C ?

The category of topological abelian groups is not abelian.  The reason is
not hard to explain.  In topological spaces, points are primordial and a
monomorphism of points need not be a monomorphism of the attached frames
(that is a surjection of the open set lattices).  When it is, then
ignoring the usual separation axiom, it is a subspace and thereby a
kernel.  In frames, the reverse is true.  Now the open sets are all and
you ignore the points.  In Chu(Ab,circle), the points and open sets are
treated with equal respect.  Now a monomorphism must be injective on the
points and surjective on the opens and is obviously a kernel.  The dual is
also true.  

At another conceptual level, abelianess is defined by certain exactness
condition, which concerns canonical arrows, usually between limits and
colimits.  A category is pointed if the canonical map 0 --> 1 is an
isomorphism and there is then a canonical arrow A + B --> A x B and when
that is an isomorphism, it is additive.  There is a map from the domain of
any monomoprhism to the kernel of its cokernel....  The conditions are
self dual and a limit is computed in a Chu category as the limit of its
first component and colimit of its second and all the required
isomoprhisms remain isomorphisms.  

Of course, this is just as true of Chu(A,_|_) whenever A is abelian (and,
of course, closed monoidal).  The contrast with the case of topological
and that of localic abelian groups is striking.

I realized all this as a result of listening to Peter Freyd's lecture in
Saint John, NB last week.  He was trying to discover the initial abelian
category with one object.  It is self dual, but not this one since this
contains no non-zero bijective (that is objects that are simultaneously
injective and projective) while Freyd's category has enough of them.
Still it might be interesting.  And to anticipate Vaughan's question, no
chu(Ab,circle) is not abelian, roughly for the same reasons as topological
and localic abelian groups.

I seem to recall that there was some difficulty for the coherence of
lax and oplax monoidal functors (properly so called, meaning with
unit maps in addition to the natural transformation).  Epstein's 1966
paper handles what I would call symmetric semigroupal functors (symmetry,
but no units), and his proof goes through without the symmetry.  I have
also once as an exercise prove the coherence theorem for strong monoidal
functors.  

This query arises tangentially in regard to a paper I am writing on
the deformation theory of monoidal categories and functors.  An answer
is not strictly needed, but I'd be greatful for a reference to the
difficulty, or a corrective to a mis-recollection on my part. (It would
be nice to include in the paper.)

Best Thoughts to all,

Actually I was going to ask about Ab.  I thought it was abelian groups
but (maybe I'm just the last to be told) the context suggests Ab =
topological abelian groups.  Is there life in discrete circles?

(To reconcile the subject line with the underlined line you need to know
Mike's usage: the large print giveth and the small print taketh away.
Chu is to chu as preordered sets are to posets, or topological spaces
to T_0 spaces.)

Ab is discrete abelian groups.  Thus the circle has, for these purposes,
the discrete topology.  Since you are mapping discrete groups to it, the
topology is irrelevant.  But the small chu category is much more like
hausdorff topological abelian groups (in fact, is equivalent to two full
subcategories of them) and is not abelian for similar reasons.  One take
on this is that separation conditions are more or less incompatible with
effective equivalence relations (= monics are kernels in the additive
case).  And extensionality is incompatible with the dual.

David Yetter asks about coherence results for monoidal functors. These were
studied in the PhD thesis of my then-student Geoff Lewis round about 1971, and
he has an article about them in that Springer Lecture Notes volume - was it
number 129 ? - on coherence in categories, edited by Saunders Mac Lane in the
early 1970s. It is one of the cases covered by the "club" idea, where the free
structure on 1 tells you all about the free structure on any category. Moreover
the case of two monoidal categories and a monoidal functor (lax, of course) is
interesting in that Lewis finds the club COMPLETELY, even though it is false
that "every diagram commutes". What is true, if f is the monoidal functor, is
that a diagram commutes if its codomain has the form f(x), in contrast to say
f(x)of(y) where o is the tensor product. Lewis also studies there the case of
a monoidal f between monoidal CLOSED categories (everything symmetric), getting
for these a PARTIAL determination of the club, like that of Kelly and Mac Lane
for a single symmetric monoidal category.

For the lax case, see

148-195.

For coherence of strong monoidal (= tensor preserving) functors, see

EXPONENTIABILITY AND SINGLE UNIVERSES
by Marta BUNGE and Susan NIEFIELD

ABSTRACT - The search for suitable single universes for opposite or dual
pairs of notions (such as those of discrete fibration and discrete
opfibration, or of open and closed inclusions, or of functions and
distributions on a Grothendieck topos) leads naturally to
exponentiability.  Using exponentiability techniques, such as
model-generated categories and glueing, we settle a standing conjecture
and an open problem.  The conjecture, due to F. Lamarche, states that for
a small category B, the category of unique factorization liftings (also
known as discrete Conduche fibrations) over B is a topos.  We also
construct the smallest topos containing the local homeomorphisms
(functions) and the complete spreads (distributions) over any given topos
satisfying a certain condition (true of presheaf toposes).  This solves a
problem posed by F. W. Lawvere.  Along the way, we introduce two new sorts
of geometric morphisms, characterize locally closed inclusions in Cat,
and investigate new features of generalized coverings in topos theory,
such as branched coverings, cuts, and complete spreads.

Have any topos-theorists or others come across the following
notion?

Let C be a small category, and c an object of C. If X is an 
arbitrary set of arrows with codomain c, then 
	
	R_X = { f:b-->c | there is no g:a-->b with fg in X}

clearly gives a sieve on c. Of course if X itself were a sieve
then R_X would be its complement, but I'm not assuming X is a
sieve. Say that a sieve R is _cofinite_ if it is of the form
R_X for a finite set X.

Cofinite sieves are closed under finite intersection and universal
quantification along an arbitrary arrow.

Best wishes,

Steve Lack.
