A week or two ago, Neil Ghani asked about natural transformations
between set-valued functors (I think they were set-valued, but anyway
that is what my answer refers to and is probably true for any reasonably
complete codomain category although a different argument would be
required), say a: F ---> G, such that for any arrow f: A ---> B of the
domain category, the square
                      aA
                FA --------> GA
                |            |
                |            |
                |Ff          |Gf
                |            |
                |            |
                v     aB     v
                FB --------> GB
 is a pullback.  At the time, I sent Neil a private reply, but it
bounced for some reason.  (I said that that I thought that this
condition was reasonable only when restricted to monic f and then such
an a is called an elementary embedding.)  Then a couple of people
answered that it was called a cartesian arrow and I didn't try to resend
my answer.  Well, there is a simpler answer.  In that generality, such
an a is called a natural equivalence.  In other words, non-trivial
examples do not exist.

To see this, it is useful to translate it, using Yoneda, into the
following form.  As usual, I will say that of two classes E and M of
arrows in a category, E _|_ M (E is orthogonal to M) if in any diagram
                  e
              A ----> B
              |       |
              |       |
              |       |
              v   m   v
              C ----> D
 with e in E and m in M, there is a unique arrow B ---> C (called a
diagonal fill-in) making both triangles commute.  Let us denote by h^A
the covariant functor represented by A and for f:  A ---> B, denote by
h^f, the induced natural transformation h^B ---> h^A.  Let E be the
class of all h^f.  Then a is cartesian iff E _|_ {a}.

Now suppose a is cartesian.  First I show that a is monic (that is
injective).  If not, there is an object A and two different arrows u, v:
h^A ---> F such that aA(u) = aA(v).  Let E be the equalizer of u and v
and let h^B ---> E be any arrow.  Then the square

                 B        A
                h -----> h
                |        |
                |        |aA(u)=aA(v)
                |        |
                v   a    v
                F -----> G
 has two diagonal fill-ins, u and v.  Here the arrow h^B ---> h^A is the
composite h^B ---> E ---> h^A and the arrow h^B ---> F is the composite
h^B ---> E ---> h^A ---> F, the latter via u or v.  In a similar way, we
can show that a is surjective.  In fact, given u: h^A ---> G, let E be a
pullback of a and u and let h^B ---> E be arbitrary.  Then we have a
commutative square

                B         A
               h  -----> h
               |         |
               |         |u
               |         |
               v    a    v
               F ------> G
 whose diagonal fill-in gives a lifting of u.

It therefore seems appropriate to restrict the question to certain
classes of arrows A ---> B, for example monics.  Here are a couple of
examples.  If g:  C --->> D is a regular (or just strict) epimorphism
between objects of the domain category, then for E the class of h^f for
all monic f, we have E _|_ {h^g}.  Similarly if E is the class of h^f
for all strict monic f and g is any epimorphism, E _|_ {h^g}.

                 Workshop on Internet Programming Languages

               in conjunction with the IEEE Computer Society 
            International Conference on Computer Languages 1998
                       Loyola University Chicago

                            May 13, 1998

The Internet has long provided a global computing infrastructure but, for most 
of its history, there has not been much interest in programming languages 
tailored specifically to that infrastructure. More recently, the Web has 
produced a widespread interest in global resources and, as a consequence, in 
global programmability. It is now commonplace to discuss how programs can be 
made to run effectively and securely over the Internet.

This workshop will provide a forum for the discussions of all aspects of 
computer languages for wide-area systems, including specification languages, 
programming languages, semantics, implementation technologies, and application 
experience.

I can't make Mike's proof type-check, so let me try the following:
For any set-valued functor, T,  from any category, let  a:O -> T
be the unique transformation from the empty functor. Isn't it 
obviously cartesian? Has Mike shown all set-valued functors are 
empty?

Good heavens.

Mike Barr's answer to Neil Ghani's question is very pretty, but
unfortunately wrong. There are many examples of cartesian natural
transformations (e.g. between functors Set --> Set) which are neither
epic nor monic: for example, the natural transformation
(-) x A --> (-) x B induced by an arbitrary map A --> B.

The mistake in Mike's proof occurs when he says

> Let E be the equalizer of u and v
> and let h^B ---> E be any arrow.

The trouble is that E could be the zero functor, so that there may
not be any arrows h^B --> E.

I refer to Michael Barr's comments on Neil Ghani's question on cartesian
natural transformations. These have been much studied, especially in 
computer science conrexts, and Michael admits he had seen the replies of
Peter Johnstone and myself, in which we independently give precise
references to our separate contributions to the study of monads whose
multiplication and unit are cartesian natural transformations; such as
the monad whose algebras are pointed sets, the multiplication for which
is the cartesian natural transformation whose A-component is A+1+1 --> A+1.

Accordingly I thought it odd that Michael, in the face of this, trusted
his proof that they exist only trivially. Of course, as Peter Johnstone
said, Michael's E is usually empty. Ironically, Michael is tha author of
a famous and striking paper on the point of the empty set, which inter
alia points out earlier errors of this kind on the part of others.

Cartesion natural transformations data:F=>L into the list functor have
	been used to represent the data-shape decomposition of many
	data types of the form FX.

	    data_X
	FX --------> LX 
	|  |         |
F! = 	|  |         | L! =
shape	|--          | length
	|            |
	F1 --------> L1 
	   data_1 =
	   arity

Examples include tree types and array types. See, for example

@Article{Jay95b,
	Author= cbj,
	Title={A semantics for shape},
        Journal={Science of Computer Programming},
        Volume=25,

        Pages={251--283}
        }

If T(X) = mu_Y. X + P(X,Y) for some polynomial P then the
	cartesian-ness of the unit for the monad follows from one of
	the main theorems of the paper above, which shows that taking
	initial algebras preserves cartesian-ness. Here it is applied
	to the (cartesian) inclusion X -> X + P(X,Y).

The winter, 97 issue of the Intelligencer contained an article about a now
deceased British applied mathematician named Michael Gerzon.  He worked on
acoustical mathematics (the article is titled, Sound and symmetry) and,
among other things, used finite dimensional representations of the circle
group to design the optimal quadriphonic system.  But the reason for this
posting is the following that I quote directly from the last paragraph of
the article: "Shortly before his death, he told me that he had realized
that category theory was a natural tool for signal processing and that he
was thinking of writing a monograph on the subject."  Presumably it never
got written, more's the pity.  But I think this is interesting
nonetheless.

Dear Colleague:

Please note that 

      May 1 : deadline for early registration and submission of abstracts

for ICM'98 is quickly approaching. We are looking forward to receiving your
registration (by WWW, fax, or surface mail) for
 
            THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF MATHEMATICIANS  
 
                    BERLIN, August 18-27, 1998

                     http://elib.zib.de/ICM98
    
The International Congress of Mathematicians, taking place about every 
four years since 1897, belongs to the most important mathematical events 
in the world. One distinguished feature, among others, is the awarding 
of the Fields Medals (the "mathematical Nobel Prize") and the Nevanlinna 
Prize during the Opening Ceremony.

The Congress is held under the auspices of the International Mathematical 
Union (IMU). Mathematicians from all countries gather to discuss recent 
developments in mathematics that are presented by leading scientists from 
all mathematical fields. Responsibility for the scientific program lies 
with the Program Committee appointed by IMU. There will be 21 one-hour 
Plenary Lectures covering the major areas of mathematics and about 
160 forty-five-minute Invited Lectures in nineteen sections 
(see http://elib.zib.de/ICM98/B for the full invited program). 

In addition to the distinct scientific program we have made strong 
efforts to set up a rich and rewarding by-program for you and your 
company. There will be:
 
- exhibitions, concerts, talks, and discussions: 
      http://elib.zib.de/ICM98/C/1/urania

- the VideoMath Festival:
      http://www-sfb288.math.tu-berlin.de/VideoMath/

- Footloose Tours:

                 Workshop on Internet Programming Languages

               in conjunction with the IEEE Computer Society 
            International Conference on Computer Languages 1998

                            May 13, 1998

The Internet has long provided a global computing infrastructure but, for most 
of its history, there has not been much interest in programming languages 
tailored specifically to that infrastructure. More recently, the Web has 
produced a widespread interest in global resources and, as a consequence, in 
global programmability. It is now commonplace to discuss how programs can be 
made to run effectively and securely over the Internet.

This workshop will provide a forum for the discussions of all aspects of 
computer languages for wide-area systems, including specification languages, 
programming languages, semantics, implementation technologies, and application 
experience.

    the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer Languages,
 in cooperation with the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages.

                   http://www.math.luc.edu/iccl98/

This is the sixth in a series of conferences devoted to all aspects of
computer languages, serving to bring together people broadly
interested in machine processable descriptions.  The hallmarks of ICCL
are diversity, openness to a wide range of linguistic research, and
international representation.  The focus is on new ideas in languages
and language technology which are innovative or experimental in
nature.

On May 13, a pre-conference Workshop on Internet Programming Languages
will be conducted at Loyola University.  Details are given at the end
of this announcement.

                            MPC '98

               Fourth International Conference on

               MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION
               -----------------------------------

             http://www.md.chalmers.se/Conf/MPC98/

                      June 15 - 17, 1998

                       Marstrand, Sweden



                    Post-conference workshops:

        * Workshop on Generic Programming, WGP'98
          http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/conf/wgp/

        * International Workshop on Constructive Methods for
          Parallel Programming, CMPP'98
          http://brahms.fmi.uni-passau.de/cl/cmpp98/index.html

        * Formal Techniques for Hardware and Hardware-like
          Systems, FTH'98
          http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~ms/FTH98/


The general theme of this series of conferences is the use of crisp,
clear mathematics in the discovery and design of algorithms and in the
development of corresponding software or hardware. The conference
theme reflects the growing interest in formal, mathematically based
methods for the construction of software and hardware. The goal of the
MPC conferences is to report on and significantly advance the state of
the art in this area. Previous conferences were held in 1989 at
Twente, The Netherlands, organised by the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, in
1992 at Oxford, United Kingdom, and in 1995 at Kloster Irsee, Germany,
organised by Augsburg University.

Registration information can be found on the homepage of the conference:

Marstrand is a small island on the beautiful westcoast of Sweden, 40
km from Gteborg. The charming old houses, the fortress, the walking
paths, and the absence of cars make this island a very pleasant
resort. There are direct flights to Gteborg Landvetter from most
European main cities, and busses from Gteborg to Marstrand.

Last year I posted the following research notes on categorical geometry: 

Abstract algebraic geometry (10/16/97)
The language of analytic categories (three parts, 11/4/97, 11/20/97, and
12/20/97)

to this list. Recently I started a small page at my home page address:

www.iswest.com/~zack

which, at present, only contains the slightly modified version (html
files) of these notes. The paper "categorical geometry" are still under
preparation, and I hope the first three chapters will be available soon.
Thanks to all those who showed interests in this project.

			Second Call for Papers
======================================================
			Workshop on Domains IV
		     Rolandseck, Germany
			  Oktober 2--4, 1998
======================================================

The Workshop on Domains is aimed at computer scientist and
mathematicians alike who share an active interest in the
mathematical foundation of computer science. It will focuse
on domains, their application and closely related topics,
e.g.~axiomatic and synthetic domain theory. In particular,
contributions establishing connections to type theory, recursion
theory and topology are welcome.

In previous years the workshop was held in Darmstadt (1994 and 1995),
Braunschweig (1996) and Munich (1997). This year it will take place in
Haus Humboldtstein, Remagen-Rolandseck (Germany), a nice last century
villa overlooking the beautiful Rhine valley.

There will be a number of guest speakers including


*** Thomas Ehrhard (IML, Marseille) ***
*** Dag Normann (Oslo Univ. )       ***
*** Giovanni Sambin (Padova Univ.)  ***


If you are interested in signing up for a talk, please send a title
and an abstract of your intended presentation to

mailto:wd4@informatik.uni-siegen.de


by MAY 15, 1998. Each request will be answered by JULY 1, 1998.
