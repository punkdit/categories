     OXFORD UNIVERSITY COMPUTING LABORATORY 
         IN COLLABORATION WITH MICROSOFT

      	       RESEARCH OFFICER

        INTENTIONAL PROGRAMMING PROJECT

Oxford University Computing Laboratory has recently started
a three-year research project in collaboration with
Microsoft Research Laboratories.  The goal is to develop a
new kind of environment for transformational programming
that permits software to be composed from a set of
independent design decisions or "intentions", using
domain-specific notations and optimization strategies. The
specific aim of the Oxford component of the work is to
design a meta-language for the environment, within which
domain-specific abstractions can be described, implemented
and reused.

We now have a vacancy for an additional research officer to
join the project with immediate effect, for an initial
period of one year, but with the expectation of an
extension to cover the three-year life of the project,
depending on continuation of the research contract.

The research officer will work at Oxford University
Computing Laboratory, together with three research students
and three academics, namely Oege de Moor, Michael Spivey and
Bernard Sufrin. The research officer's specific tasks will
include:

(a) identifying suitable features of current meta languages
in compiler construction and automated theorem proving.

(b) designing and building a prototype implementation of a
suitable meta language.

(c) experimenting with the use of that meta language in
case studies.  

The successful candidate will

* have demonstrated research ability in a Computing-related
discipline,

* have experience of programming language design and
implementation, transformational programming, or automated
theorem proving,

* actively enjoy the challenge of collaborating with
engineers working in industry.  

Familiarity with formal methods of program construction 
will be an advantage.

Salary will be on the age and experience related RS1A grade
(currently 15,735 to 23,651 p.a.).  Applications should
clearly state the post title and be in the form of a full
curriculum vitae plus application letter, together with the
names of two referees. Further details and selection
criteria are available from
http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/jobs.html 
or on request to The Administrator of the Computing Laboratory.

The completed application should be sent to arrive before
the closing date of Friday 6th November 1998 and be
addressed to: The Administrator, Oxford University
Computing Laboratory, Wolfson Building, Parks Road, Oxford
OX1 3QD.  (Email: Mike.Field@comlab.ox.ac.uk) .  Oxford
University is an Equal Opportunities Employer

Informal email enquiries about the academic aspects of
this project and this post are welcome, and should be 
directed to one of the academics: 
        oege@comlab.ox.ac.uk   (Oege de Moor) 
        mike@comlab.ox.ac.uk   (Michael Spivey)
        sufrin@comlab.ox.ac.uk (Bernard Sufrin)

Oxford University Computing Laboratory is a full academic
department of the University and at present has
twenty-seven academic staff, thirty-five research officers
and approximately sixty doctoral students, engaged in
teaching and carrying out research in computer science and
numerical analysis.

Johnstone and Wraith "Algebraic Theories in a Topos".

The nno provides internally an infinite object. Once it is there, the
elementary topos structure can be used to construct other free algebras.
However, the constructions use exponentiation and subobject classifier, and
pretopos structure is not enough. Adam Eppendahl and I are working on a
conjecture that the structure of Joyal's Arithmetic Universes is sufficient
to construct general free algebras, that structure comprising (following
ideas of Joyal and Wraith) pretopos structure + free categories over graphs
+ free category actions over graph actions.

Does any body know if comma categories have been defined in

I have an idea of how they can be defined in some particular
contexts, such as Cat-categories or Simplicial-categories, but I
don't know if there is a general definition or even if a
definition in the above two contexts can be found in the
literature.

I'm not sure if it's what you have in mind, but combining comma categories
and enrichment is the theme of

  Bonjour. I am a statistician and I should be interested in a categorical
framework for probability and statistical theory. Does anyone know
references (books, articles, websites...) about applications of categories
and functors to probability or even measure theory ? Thank you.

A crucial point is whether the recipient of the enriching is cartesian or
not. Note that fully internalising always must involve a cartesian aspect
since one must diagonalize on the parametrizers of families of objects 
(at least) in order to explain eg natural transformations, even if the
parametrizers for individual homs are not cartesian (eg linear or metric).

One can envisage replacing individual "comma" categories by families of
categories parametrized by (commutative) coalgebras, which seems just a
way of constructing a cartesian category for the purpose, to which it may
or may not be adequate. 

Symmetric monoidal categories in which the unit object is terminal seem to
have a special role, but that may be illusory.(After all "any" smc is
covered by one with that additional property) . Perhaps the affine modules
( see my paper "Grassmann's dialectics and category theory") constitute a
good test case for proposed constuctions

>Does any body know if comma categories have been defined in

Lawvere's La Jolla paper, where general comma categories were introduced,
showed how to construct them from pullbacks and a "cylinder" (or "arrow
object") construction.  John Gray (SLNM p. 254) showed that cylinder is a
universal notion which a 2-category may or may not have. I pointed out
[Fibrations and Yoneda's lemma in a 2-category, Lecture Notes in Math. 420
(1974) 104-133;     MR53#585] that finite completeness for a 2-category
should mean that it have pullbacks, a terminal object, and cylinders (a
similar idea was in my PhD thesis for differential graded categories which
are finitely complete when they admit pullbacks, a zero object and
"suspension"). Finite completeness for 2-categories is further analysed in
[Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 8
(1976) 149-181; MR53#5695].

More generally, finite completeness for a V-category  A (= a category with
homs enriched in  V) means that its underlying category has finite ordinary
limits, which are preserved by representables  A(a,-)  into  V,  and that
it admits cotensoring by the "finite" objects of  V.  There is some choice
about what you mean by "finite" object in  V  however "finitely
presentable" is often the right thing.  Sometimes, as in the case of  V =
Cat, the finite objects are generated by a few finite objects - that is why
"cylinder" plays the important role in 2-categories (it is the finite
generating object, cotensor with which is cylinder).

So why am I going on about finite limits in 2-categories?  Well, Lawvere's
construction shows that comma objects exist in any finitely complete
2-category.  Comma objects are particular finite limits just like
pullbacks.

In particular, there is a 2-category  V-Cat  of V-categories, V-functors
and V-natural transformations.  It is certainly complete (as a 2-category)
for any decent  V.   So, indeed, it is well known that comma objects (or
comma V-categories) exist.  They have their uses but NOT for the wonderful
use that Lawvere put them to:  Lawvere provided a formula for left (right)
Kan extensions of ordinary functors which involves taking a colimit (limit)
over a comma category. [Indeed, more is true; see my definition of
"pointwise Kan extension" in "Fibrations and Yoneda's lemma in a
2-category".]  However, this formula does not work even for additive
categories (= categories enriched in the monoidal category of abelian
groups).

The twisted arrow category of  A  is the category of elements of the hom
functor  A(-,-) : A^op x A --> Set.  In internal and variable category
theory there is a sense in which the twisted arrow fibration comes first
and then can be used to define hom functors and local smallness.  For
example, see page 292 of my paper

Cosmoi of internal categories, Transactions American Math. Soc. 258 (1980)
271-318; MR82a:18007

We are working on a related problem. It seems that it is necessary to work
with
a relaxed notion of category, namely where the compostion of
f:a->b and g:b->c is not always defined. You should look at relaxed
notions of category such as composition graphs, paracategories,
precategories
and the like.

On our own preliminary results look at the working paper

	No, it seems not since a co-generator for omega cat
would surely give rise to one for cat in particular, but such
does not exist. This contrasts with the situation for the
"larger" universe of simplicial sets.  A category of "small"
sets is a kind of approximation to a co-generator, but each
enlargement of the meaning of "small" creates new categories
which are not co-generated.

The argument sounds reasonable. Before this question, I was 
convinced of the existence of this cogenerator. I have to find
something else for the lemma I would like to prove...

Since it does not exist, I have another questions (I suppose well-
known) and any reference abou the subject would be welcome : 

How does one prove the cocompleteness of omegaCat (small & strict) ?
The only idea of proof I had in mind until this question was : omegaCat
is obviously complete (and the forgetful functor towards the category of Sets 
preserves projective limits), and well-powered and a cogenerator 
=> the cocompleteness (Borceux I, prop 3.3.8 p 112).

Without cogenerator, how can one prove the cocompleteness ? The explicit 
construction of the colimit seems to be very hard : the forgetful
functor towards Set does not preserve colimits because the 
underlying set of the colimit might be bigger than the colimit of the
underlying sets. Every time two n-morphisms are identified in the 
colimit of the underlying sets, p-morphisms (with p>n) might be "created"
by the colimit.

Thanks in advance for any answer. pg.

I imagine that omega-categories, however defined, will be a locally
c-presentable category (c=cardinal of the continuum) in the sense of
Gabriel-Ulmer, equivalently complete and c-accessible in the sense of
Makkai-Pare and hence cocomplete.  In other words, the colimit will grow
but not by much.  Actually, aleph_1 is all you are really going to need.

Dear Carlos

Comma categories are explained, for example, in Mac Lane's book "Categories
for the working mathematician" Grad Texts in Math #5 (Springer). In a sense
they are "lax pullbacks" defined when given two functors with the same
codomain. Hence, just as we can carry over the notion of pullback in Set to
any category, we can carry over, by representability, the notion of comma
category from Cat to any 2-category (I call them comma objects in SLNM
420).

Exaggerating only slightly, the whole reason enriched category theory got
going in the 60s was to deal with the example of differential graded
categories: these are categories enriched in chain complexes
(Eilenberg-Kelly "Closed categories" LaJolla 1965).  As I understand it,
that example prompted Sammy and Max to their joint work: they had each used
DG-categories before.

My thesis [0] was not published in full. For the published papers [2], [5]
on the thesis, I took out the stuff on DG-categories. However, [25] uses
the DG-category approach very strongly and gives new proofs of more general
results (I had some of these at the time of my thesis but hadn't included
them). The papers provide universal coefficients (or homotopy
classification) theorems for diagrams of chain complexes.

In response to Ph. Gaucher's question:
  I (try to, at least...) treat this question for weak $n$-categories in
my preprint ``Limits in $n$-categories'', available on the xxx preprint
server as alg-geom 9708010. If I understand correctly, the set-theoretical
problem you raise is the same as the one encountered in section 5 of my
preprint.

The conclusion is that the (weak) $n+1$-category $nCAT$ is closed under
direct limits.

  It seems that coproducts of strict $n$-categories, if they exist,
cannot actually be the ``right'' ones because in that case, every weak
$n$-category would be equivalent to a strict one. I haven't made this
argument rigorous, though.

---Carlos Simpson

PS what is a ``comma category'' or ``comma object''?

The existence of colimits can be proved by adjoint functor type 
arguments: Lew Hardy and I wrote out details for the not too 
dissimilar situation of topological groupoids in 

``Topological groupoids I: universal constructions'', {\em Math. Nachr.} 
71 (1976) 273-286. 

Identification of vertices of a groupoid (or category) gives what Philip 
Higgins called a universal groupoid or category, and of course more 
compositions are allowed. Philip constructed this explicitly, but it also 
follows from the general construction. There is a mention of the 
cocompleteness of the multiple situation in 
 (with P.J. HIGGINS), ``On the algebra of cubes'', {\em J. Pure Appl. 
Algebra} 21 (1981) 233-260. (see p. 238). 

Analysis and computation of colimits of various forms of multiple 
groupoids is necessary for applying Generalised Van Kampen Theorems - 
for the groupoid case this is most conveniently done in the `small' 
model of crossed complexes. 

For cat^n-groups (= n-fold categories in 
groups) it is probably most convenient to work in Ellis-Steiner's 
crossed n-cubes of groups (generalising Guin-Walery/Loday's crossed 
squares). Analysing pushouts of crossed squares led Loday and me to the 
non-abelian tensor product of groups (which act on each other).  

The identification of p-cells in an n-category (n>p) to give a new
n-category is discussed in relation to homotopy theory in my survey
``Homotopy theory, and change of base for groupoids and multiple
groupoids'', {\em Applied categorical structures}, 4 (1996) 175-193.    
That is, it shows how complicated and interesting are even simple cases of 
this general idea. We show how the n-adic Hurewicz theorem can be seen as 
an example of this in 
 (with J.-L. LODAY), ``Homotopical excision, and Hurewicz theorems, for 
$n$-cubes of spaces'', {\em Proc. London Math. Soc.} (3) 54 (1987) 176-192. 
(This was the first proof of even a triadic Hurewicz theorem. The 
relative case goes back to early homotopy theory.) 

The general idea is of universally constructing an n-fold category 
from lower dimensional information, or lower dimensional 
identifications.                               

The computational aspect (how to compute the answers) seems really 
interesting. One expects to be able to be more explicit in the groupoid 
case. On the other hand, even general double groupoids are a bit 
mysterious.

As to the cocompleteness of Omega-Cat, it is a result of Harvey Wolff that
V-Cat is cocomplete for decent  V.  By induction, it follows that n-Cat is
cocomplete (since (n+1)-Cat = n-Cat).  A limiting process gives that
Omega-Cat is also cocomplete.

However, a better approach is to use a result of Michael Batanin that
Omega-Cat is finitarily monadic over globular sets (a presheaf category).
It follows that  Omega-Cat  is cocomplete.

The required monad on globular sets is beautiful: it involves plane trees. See:

theory of weak n-categories, Advances in Mathematics 136 (1998) 39-103.

In reply to the query of Jean-Pierre Cotton, I would like to mention the
following:
 
	In Springer LNM 915 (1982), an article by Michele Giry develops some
aspects of "A categorical approach to probability theory".The key idea,
which also was discussed in an unpublished 1962 paper of mine, is that
random maps between spaces are just maps in a category of convex spaces
between "simplices". There is a natural (semi) metric on the homs which
permits measuring the failure of diagrams to commute precisely, suggesting
statistical criteria. To make full use of the monoidal closed structure,as
well as to account for convex constraints on random maps,it seems
promising to consider also nonsimplices. (Noncategories is usually not a
good idea). The central observation that the metrizing process is actually
a monoidal functor was exploited in the unpublished doctoral thesis here
at Buffalo by X-Q Meng a few years ago in order to clarify statistical
decision procedures and stochastic processes as diagrams in a basic
convexity category. She can be reached at : meng@lmc.edu   

Best wishes to those interested in pursuing this topic!

Some comments.

You're simply not comparing like-with-like.  The differences in 
performance that you're seeing have nothing to do with the boxing/ 
unboxing issues that you claim are involved.

(1) Your C code compares using two floating point operations 
(subtraction, compare), while the fish program uses just one (no 
subtraction).

(2) The output of the fish-to-C translation uses statically allocated 
memory, and won't multi-thread correctly.  Sun Solaris does support 
multi-threading, so while your compiler uses statically allocated 
memory here, the Solaris C library can't.  [As a matter of interest, 
what happens if you call your fish quicksort with a comparison 
function that itself calls quicksort?].

(3) The C library qsort takes a three-valued comparison function, 
while your fish code uses a two-valued comparison.

["never"?  Show me an unboxed cyclic data structure.]

(4) As you note, your fish code gets optimised by specialising to the
datatype and comparison function used.  This is the main 
performance issue, and has nothing to do with boxing/unboxing issues.
Note that the C library qsort is a polymorphic function, is not 
specialised to particular arguments, and still takes an array of 
unboxed elements.

Specialising functions to their arguments is nothing new to FISh - 
some (but not all) C compilers, for instance, on inlining a function 
will also specialise it.  The reason why the qsort function is not
specialised to its arguments is because it's a precompiled library 
function, not because it's written in C.

> The reason is that the C program achieves polymorphism by requiring

The reality is that the machine code generated by your fish program 
ends up dealing with pointers also: on a typical RISC processor, to 
compare two doubles held in memory, you need to compute the addresses 
of the doubles, load them into registers and do the comparison.

Passing pointers to the comparison function just means that the 
values are loaded into registers in the function, rather than before 
the function call.  Whether its faster to load the values into 
registers before the function call or in the function will depend on 
things like instruction scheduling in the compiler & CPU, & register 
allocation in the caller & in any case the difference will be tiny.

> As well as slowing down the program, these pointers are a source of

It's not very often that you want to sort an array of numbers.  If 
you want to sort some records that contain both a sort-key and some 
extra data, then using pointers is faster.

This is to announce a new paper, by

   Marta Bunge and Marcelo Fiore, "Unique factorization Lifting Functors
and Categories of Processes".

        http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~mf/CONCURRENCY/ufl.dvi

	http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/~mf/CONCURRENCY/ufl.ps


The paper is organised as follows. After an Introduction, Section 1
presents background material motivated from the point of view of computer
science.  In Section 2, the category UFL of unique factorisation lifting
(ufl) functors is recalled and its basic properties are studied. Section 3
explores applications of ufl functors to concurrency.  In particular we
show that they may be used in the study of interleaving models like
transition systems.  In Section 4, we introduce triangulated categories.
Our main use for them is in Section 5 where, for C a triangulated category,
we exhibit the category UFL/C as a sheaf topos. These toposes may be
regarded as models of linearly-controlled processes.  Some
concluding remarks are provided in Section 6.

Mac Lane (Categories for the Working Mathematician) does one direction
in Theorem 2 on page 190. (He assumes enrichment over abelian groups
rather than commutative monoids, but a glance at the proof shows that
the additive inverses are not used.) The converse is stated as Exercise
4 on page 194.

Re: Mike Barr's question concerning two equivalent definitions
    of a class of categories

    Since the term 'additive' had already been established to refer
to the special case where the homs are abelian groups, I called 
these 'linear categories' in my paper

    Categories of Space and of Quantity
    in The Space of Mathematics, Philosophical, Epistemological
    and Historical Explorations, de Gruyter, Berlin (1992) pp 14-30

because 'linear' is a term well known to engineers, statisticians and
others, and because these categories form the natural environment for
applications of Linear Algebra.  Of course, the entries in the matrices
are in general maps, not necessarily scalars, although scalars for which
the addition is idempotent are an important special case. (Here by the 
scalars of such a category I mean the elements of the rig which is its
center.) 
	In that paper I referred to what I believe is the first reference
to this theory, namely Saunders Mac Lane's 1950 paper

     Duality for Groups, Bull AMS vol 56, pp 485-516, (1950)

expounding work he did in the late 40's.

We have a unique chance over the next few weeks to influence various
international standards bodies in presenting a complete set of mathematical
and other scientific characters for inclusion in standard character sets.
Much of the work for this has already been done, but there remain some
problem characters on which we really need the help of the author community
to describe uses and distinctions from other similar characters. Further
details are available from the math society web site at:

       http://www.ams.org/STIX/glyphs/proposal/newsub/challenge.html

The AMS has set a November 20 deadline for receipt of this information,
so there is not much time to act. Thanks for your help!

I have checked Mac Lane's 1950 paper and I cannot find any such result.
The converse, that a category in which finite sums are equivalent to
products then the category takes homs in commutative monoids is sort of
there, but the one I asked is not, or at least I didn't find it.  However,
CWM is a likely source and I will check that out.  I just need some
reference in any case.

Dear Mike and everbody
The converse result , as stated by Mac Lane, was what needed to be said in
1950, especially since it began to bring out that category theory has
content. What it's converse to, namely that when maps can be added then
the cartesian product has the mapping property now called coproduct, had
already been folklore for years... or if it hadn't been, how else to
explain the widespread terminological ambiguity concerning "direct sums"?
Perhaps a much older reference needs to be adduced.
Thanks for bringing this up.
Best regards
Bill
