As someone who had long secretly seen Sammy as a sort of second father figure,
I am somewhat unnerved that the date of his death coincided so perfectly
with what would have been exactly my mother's 102nd birthday.

Well, perhaps you should have been blaming me after all. I clearly never
got around to teaching you Ernst Witt's amazing proof (Beweisstudien zum
Satz von M. Zorn, Math. Nachr. 4 (1951), 434--438) of the existence of
fixed points for an s:X->X which is merely assumed to be inflationary
(i.e. x \leq s(x) for all x \in X), and not necessarily monotone. (Of 
course, you can recover the result for monotone s by restricting to the
subset \{x\in X | x \leq s(x)\}.)

[I may say that I didn't discover this paper for myself; it was brought to
my notice by Bernhard Banaschewski (who had obvious reasons for knowing
about it). It appears that Brian Davey and Hilary Priestley also knew
about it, since they included it as Theorem 4.14 in their "Introduction 
to Lattices and Order" (C.U.P., 1990), though they don't attribute it to
Witt (or to anyone else).]

Witt's proof, like Pataraia's, is entirely order-theoretic and uses only
naive set theory; it is clearly inspired by Zermelo's second proof of the
well-ordering theorem, to which Paul referred. What it does use, however, is
the Law of Excluded Middle, in a way which seems absolutely inextricable from
the proof. Nevertheless, I suspect that an extremely clever person, trying
to constructivize Witt's proof, could have discovered the idea of Pataraia's.
(I didn't, although I spent some ten years thinking about the problem on and
off; Pataraia didn't either -- he told me in November that he wasn't aware
of Witt's proof.)

Indeed you could. The same is true of Witt's proof: I did teach it, last
term, in my third-year logic course here in Cambridge. (The students
found it quite tough going, but they managed to swallow it -- I think.)
A couple of weeks later I learned of Pataraia's proof at the Aarhus PSSL
meeting; so the students got that too, immediately after I returned to
Cambridge. (They must think I'm obsessed with this particular theorem;
perhaps they're right.)

There remains an open problem, however. Pataraia's proof is constructive
(that is, it works in any topos -- though it is impredicative, so the
Martin-L\"of people won't accept it), but it does require the function s
to be monotone as well as inflationary. So: can anyone find a constructive
proof of Witt's original result (without the monotonicity assuption)?

HEADLINE: Samuel Eilenberg, Dies; Mathematician at Columbia

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:

Samuel Eilenberg, an eminent mathematician and collector of Asian art,
died on Friday at the Isabella Geriatric Center in upper Manhattan,
where he had been for three months. He was 84 and had been a longtime
resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

   He had been in poor health for the last three years, said Robert L.
Poster, one of the co-executors of his estate.  Dr. Eilenberg retired
in 1982 as a University Professor, the highest professorial rank, at
Columbia University, where he had taught since 1947. He was born in
Warsaw and moved in 1939 to the United States, where he became
renowned for his work in the fields of algebraic topology and
homological algebra. He served twice as chairman of Columbia's
mathematics department, and taught at the University of Michigan from
1940 to 1946 and at the University of Indiana in 1946 and 1947.

   In 1986, he was a co-winner, with Atle Selberg of the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton, of the $100,000 Wolf Foundation Prize in
Mathematics.

   Beginning in the mid-1950's, Dr. Eilenberg amassed an art
collection comprising many small sculptures and other artifacts, in
bronze, silver, stone and other materials. The works were made between
the 3d century B.C. and the 17th century in Indonesia, Pakistan,
India, Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Central Asia. The
collection came to be valued at more than $5 million.

   Then in 1987, he gave more than 400 artifacts from the collection
to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which put on a show of holdings
from his collection, "The Lotus Transcendent: Indian and Southeast
Asian Art From the Samuel Eilenberg Collection," in 1991 and 1992. In
return for his generosity, the museum raised most of the $1.5 million
necessary to create the Samuel Eilenberg Visiting Professorship of
Mathematics at Columbia.

   Another member of Columbia's mathematics department, Prof. John W.
Morgan, said, "The theme that runs through Sammy's mathematics is
always to find the absolutely essential ingredients in any problem and
work only with those ingredients and nothing else -- in other words,
to get rid of all the superfluous information."

   When someone once asked Professor Eilenberg if he could eat Chinese
food with three chopsticks, he answered, "Of course," according to
Professor Morgan. The questioner asked, "How are you going to do it?"
and Professor Eilenberg replied, "I'll take the three chopsticks, I'll
put one of them aside on the table, and I'll use the other two."

   Dr. Eilenberg always applied that simplifying approach in his
mathematical work, Professor Morgan said, and that helped him in his
pioneering work in algebraic topology.

   In the 1930's, 40's and 50's, he was one of the main researchers in
algebraic topology, the use of algebraic techniques to study problems
involving shapes. Professor Eilenberg also helped develop a related
field, homological algebra.

   He and a co-author, Prof. Norman E. Steenrod of Princeton
University, collaborated in studying algebraic topology. They set out
their findings in a 1952 book, "Foundations of Algebraic Topology"
(Books on Demand), which is one of the primary sources in the field.

   The two mathematicians developed axioms, or rules, for analyzing
objects through algebraic topology.

   "The Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms were crucial," Professor Morgan
said, "in exposing the essential features of the constructions of
algebraic topology."

   Professor Eilenberg's mathematical work in algebraic topology began
in his native Warsaw in the mid-1930's, while he was studying at the
University of Warsaw. He received his doctorate there in 1936.

   His many writings include the book "Homological Algebra"
(Princeton, 1956) which he wrote with Henri Cartan.

   Professor Eilenberg received Guggenheim and Fulbright Fellowships
and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and
other professional groups.

His 1960 marriage to Natasha Chterenzon ended in divorce in 1969.

We noted that the Feb 3 New York Times description of Sammy Eilenberg's
life contained notable ommissions, and in particular seriously
under-represents the glorious achievements of the Columbia University Math
Dept.  Therefore we are sending the following letter to the Times, hoping
that they'll print it.


Editor:
         We were moved by your obituary of Professor Samuel
Eilenberg, the eminent Columbia University mathematician.
Our lives, like those of his many other students and colleagues
around the world, were profoundly influenced by his 'insistence
on getting to the bottom of things'.
        It is widely known in the mathematical community
that Professor Eilenberg's most influential long-term
collaboration was with the senior US mathematician
Saunders Mac Lane, of the University of Chicago.  Their joint
discovery in 1945 of the theory of transformations between
mathematical categories provided the tools without which Sammy's
important collaborations with Steenrod and Cartan, which you mentioned,
would not have been possible.
        That joint work laid also the basis for Sammy's pioneering
work in theoretical computer science and for a great many
continuing developments in geometry, algebra, and the
foundations of mathematics.  In particular, the Eilenberg-Mac Lane
theory of categories was indispensable to the 1960 development,
by the French mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, of
the powerful form of algebraic geometry which was an ingredient
in several recent advances in number theory, including Wiles'
work on the Fermat theorem.

Sincerely,
Professor F. W. Lawvere, SUNY Buffalo
Professor P.J. Freyd, University of Pennsylvania

To appear in Proceedings of the Workshop on Higher Category Theory 
and Mathematical Physics at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois,
March 1997, eds. Ezra Getzler and Mikhail Kapranov.

Categorification is the process of finding category-theoretic analogs of
set-theoretic concepts by replacing sets with categories, functions with
functors, and equations between functions by natural isomorphisms
between functors, which in turn should satisfy certain equations of
their own, called `coherence laws'.   Iterating this process requires a
theory of `n-categories', algebraic structures having objects,
morphisms between objects, 2-morphisms between morphisms and so on up to
n-morphisms.  After a brief introduction to n-categories and their
relation to homotopy theory, we discuss algebraic structures that can be
seen as iterated categorifications of the natural numbers and integers.
These include tangle n-categories, cobordism n-categories, and the homotopy 
n-types of the loop spaces Omega^k S^k.  We conclude by describing a 
definition of weak n-categories based on the theory of operads.

Dear Colleagues,

  Has anyone come across or have any interest in the following
  fibrational formulation of formal language theory?  This is an
  observation of Robin Cockett during his recent visit to
  Braunschweig.

  Let T be the list monad on set and let set_T be the corresponding
  Kleisli category.  Consider the functor from (set_T)^op to ord that
  maps a set_T-morphism A --f-> B (i.e., a set-function A --f-> T(B)=B^*) 
  to the inverse image function from the power set of B^* to the power
  set of A^* (ordered by inclusion) induced by the unique extension
  \bar f of f.  It corresponds to a bi-fibration  lang --U-> set_T.
  The objects of the category  lang  are pairs <L,V> with V a set and
  L\inc V^* a language over V.  A  lang  morphism from <L,V> to <M,W> is
  a set_T-morphism V --h-> W subject to the requirement that L be
  contained in the inverse image of M under \bar h, or equivalently,
  that the direct image of L under \bar h be contained in M.

  Recall that a language L\inc V^* is of type

    0, if it is generated by some grammar,
    1, it it is generated by a context-sensitive grammar,
    2, it it is generated by a context-free grammar,
    3, if it is generated by a regular grammar.

  Now we may consider the subcategories lang_i of lang, 0<=i<=3, where
  the languages have to be of type i.  Standard results of formal
  language theory tell us that for i\in\{0,2,3\} the restriction of U to
  lang_i still is a bi-fibration, while the restriction of U to lang_1
  still is a fibration, but not a cofibration, since homomorphic
  images of type-1 languages need not be of type 1.  For type-2
  languages, a theorem of Greibach states the existence of a universal
  such, i.e., a context-free language L_{gr} such that every other
  context-free language is a homomorphic pre-image of L_{gr}.  ([HK]
  has a construction of L_{gr} over a 7-element alphabet, but then
  one can of course find another such universal context-free language
  over a 2-element alphabet.)

Hello!

I'm trying to learn category theory and understand its links to computer
science. One of my big questions is:

Is category theory a wonderful specification language, or is there any
executable stuff in it ?

All I've seen about application until now is specification or semantics
(which is already a lot!) but I wonder if anything else was ever done.
Thank you for any direct answer or any pointer to good texts about this.

Page 216 of Lambek and Scott describes how to decompose a topos via a
cocover, that is, a monomorphism in Top

    M : T -> prod(i in I) T/P_i

where P_i are the prime filters of T.

(1) Does anyone know where to find a more extended discussion of this
    decomposition?

(2) Is there a dual decomposition via a cover, that is, an
    epimorphism

    E : sum(i in I) T_i -> T ?

This construction could already be in Lambek and Scott, but I haven't
had the chance to study L&S in detail, so I'm still in over my head.

The conjecture (due to Y.V. Srinivas) is that these ideas are useful
for structuring a database of theories by breaking theories into their
smallest reasonable subtheories.  See the paper on Specware by
Srinivas and Jullig on Kestrel's website http://www.kestrel.edu for
more information.  So far, this work has dealt with covers of
theories, rather than cocovers, whence my question.

We can say that an object P in a category with coproducts is *prime*
if whenever f : P -> A+B, f factors through one of the injections into
A+B.

(1) I didn't find any reference to this (obvious) notion of
    primality in the standard texts.  Does it occur anywhere?

(2) Is there any condition on the category under which the set of
    primes is a generating family?  Since objects are decomposable
    into a "quotient of a coproduct of generators" (Borceux, volume 1,

                  Announcement of PhD Studentship in

             Categorical Logic in Denotational Semantics


A PhD student is sought for three years from October 1998 to work
under the supervision of Dr. Alex Simpson on an EPSRC-funded project:
Categorical Logic and Structure in Denotational Semantics. The project
will apply category theory to axiomatize the essential structure of
denotational models of programming languages. The student will work on
the derivation of program logics from category-theoretic
axiomatizations, and on the proof-theoretical analysis of such logics.

The studentship is for three years and pays for all fees and includes
maintenance (living expenses) at the usual EPSRC rate.

The studentship will be held at the Laboratory for Foundations of
Computer Science (LFCS), Department of Computer Science, University of
Edinburgh. 

The LFCS provides an ideal environment for postgraduate research. The
first six months of postgraduate training are supported by a unique
postgraduate course on the theory of computation. In addition, there
are regular short courses on advanced research topics, and a number of
forums provide weekly research seminars. The LFCS is particularly strong
in the area of semantics of programming languages.

The PhD studentship is relevant to computer science or mathematics
graduates who are interested in at least one topic from: theory of
computation, denotational semantics, logic, category theory.

Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca

Hopefully this is my last question for a while.

Has there been work on a categorical model for "while programs" (or,
equivalently, assembly language) and Floyd-Hoare logic?

In the obvious model, objects are predicates on a store, and arrows
are code sequences mapping stores to stores that satisfy the
postcondition assuming the precondition.

I'm interested to know:

  (1) What is the structure of this category?
      Does it have products, sums, etc?
      What program constructs do they correspond to?

  (2) What is the correct equality on arrows?  I would think that
      we want the finest equality that yields nice structure.  Then we
      can collapse afterward to obtain coarser categories.

The first such was developed by Arbib and Manes in the mid-70's.  Manes
went on to develop the theory in great detail, writing a near-book-length
article on it a decade later, not sure where it appeared.

  (1) What is the structure of this category?

As I recall it was an additive (semiadditive?) category, with sequential
composition represent by composition, and choice by sum within homsets.
The objects were predicates, the arrows were programs (aka predicate
transformers).

      Does it have products, sums, etc?  What program constructs do they
      correspond to?

Not sure about products, but it certainly had sums.  which was how
if-then-else was handled.

  (2) What is the correct equality on arrows?
 
My recollection is that it was fully abstract: the correct equality is
equality.

> My motication (in 1987 this was)
This should have been 1984 (and motivation).

I'd also like to add:

I had some difficulty in getting my ideas about stable coequalisers
across (partly, of course, my fault, because I didn't get the rigt
answer, involving stable transitive closures, until 1993).  People
said, "while programs can't possibly be described by finitary first
order theories, because the theory of the natural numbers is an
example".

I knew that, and it wasn't what I meant.  This illustrates a subtlely
in first order categorical logic: that the relevant structure consists
of *less* than all finite (limits and) stable disjoint colimits. The
categorical structure corresponding to first order logic is a (Heyting)
pretopos, which need not have coequalisers of arbitrary parallel pairs.
For example, the category of compact Hausdorff spaces is a pretopos but
does not have all stable coequalisers. (I have a feeling I haven't
got this quite right, and Peter Freyd is going to jump on me. I shouldn't
be so foolish as to answer mathematical questions on the modem from home!)

More recently, Jiri Rosicky and Peter Johnstone have considered the
question of what theories can be expressed with finite sketches.
As Peter Freyd showed in 1972, this includes the natural numbers.
My results and those of Jiri and Peter are more complicated forms of
Peter Freyd's original observation.

Finally, since my more recent work on categorical recursion, I no
longer think that a coequaliser diagram is the best way of presenting
a WHILE program categorically (though the diagram I would use now
expresses the same logical content).

I see Roy Crole has already answered this question on my behalf.
The paper to which he refers is called "An Exact Interpretation of While"
and is "while-1993.dvi.gz" on my page at Hypatia
	http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/author/TaylorP

Manes' appraoach, as I recall, looks a bit like matrix algebra,
with finite addition replaced by infinite union.  From a programming
point of view this seems to me like replacing a WHILE program (which
doesn't know a priori how many times it is going to go round) with
an infinite SWITCH/CASE statement indexed by the number of iterations.

My motication (in 1987 this was) was that it only takes finitely many
characters to write the program, so its semantics should be given
in a finitary form.  The bit of the (categorical) diagram which does
the work is a coequaliser, and Barry Jay observed independently that
this says in categorical language that the WHILE program is the
"universal loop invariant".

The coequaliser is not the whole story.  It does not say when to exit
the loop: some modifications to the diagram using pullbacks are needed.
Nor will coequalisers in any old category do (cd the need for at least
distributive and preferably extensive categories for if-then-else).
I spent a long time trying to formulate the need for "stable" coequalisers
correctly, but this never worked.  It was necessary to fall back on
stability of the formation of transitive or equivalence closures.

There is a completely rewritten account of my work on WHILE programs
in Section 6.4 of my book (not yet, I'm afraid, finished).

The category theory does not match up quite as nicely as one would like
("full abstraction") for WHILE or even IF-THEN-ELSE.  (The interpretation
is sound, but what I know about it falls short of the equivalence
which exists, for example, between lambda calculus and CCCs).

My treatment of Floyd-Hoare logic is done in the greatest detail for
what I call the direct declarative language (with assignments but no
conditionals or loops).  This is integrated with the categorical 
account of algebraic or finite-product theories.  I now think I can
motivate the definition of category and product EASIER on the basis
of programming than from traditional mathematics.

Floyd-Hoare logic & algebraic theories are in Chapter IV, conditionals
in Section 5.5.

Paul

PS Yes, I know I've got to get this book finished. There are just not
enough hours in the day!

Dear David,

One convenient setting for your question is provided by _extensive_
categories (see the paper ``Introduction to extensive and distributive
categories'' by Carboni, Lack, and Walters, appearing in JPAA 1993). A
category E with finite coproducts is said to be extensive if for all 
objects x,y of E, the ``coproduct functor'' E/x x E/y --> E/(x+y) is
an equivalence. For such a category E, an object p is prime in your
sense if and only if it is connected, i.e. if and only if it admits no
proper coproduct decomposition; this in turn is equivalent to the 
representable functor E(p,-):E-->Set preserving coproducts.

An example of an extensive category is given by Fam(C) for C a (small)
category. The objects of Fam(C) are finite families (C_i)_{i\in I}
and an arrow from (C_i)_I to (D_j)_J comprises a function f:I-->J and
a family of arrows C_i-->D_fi in C. Fam(C) is the free category with
finite coproducts on the category C. The connected (=prime) objects
are precisely the singleton families. One can characterize the 
categories of the form Fam(C) as those extensive categories with a 
small set of connected objects such that every object is a finite 
coproduct of connected objects. (It seems possible that you could 
replace ``extensive'' in the last sentence by ``category with finite
coproducts'' provided that you also replace ``connected'' by
``prime and connected'', but I haven't thought about this.)

Best wishes,

Steve.

We apologize for multiple copies of this mail.

The following paper will appear in the Journal of Logic and
Computation (expected in Vol. 8) later this year:


	       A Relevant Analysis of Natural Deduction

			 S Ishtiaq and DJ Pym
		   Queen Mary and Westfield College
			 University of London
			{si,pym}@dcs.qmw.ac.uk

  We study a framework, RLF, for defining natural deduction
  presentations of linear and other relevant logics. RLF consists in a
  language together, in a manner similar to that of LF, with a
  representation mechanism. The language of RLF, the
  $\lambda\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus, is a system of first-order linear
  dependent function types which uses a function $\kappa$ to describe
  the degree of sharing of variables between functions and their
  arguments. The representation mechanism is judgements-as-types,
  developed for linear and other relevant logics.  The
  $\lambdal\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus is a conservative extension of the
  $\lambda\Pi$-calculus and RLF is a conservative extension of LF. 


The paper will be available from our Hypatia entries, at
http://hypatia.dcs.qmw.ac.uk. It is also available at
http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~si.

We are currently engaged in further study of the proof theory of the
$\lambda\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus; this includes setting up a
proposition-as-types correspondence and a Gentzenization of the type
theory. We are also investigating categorical models, specifically
resourced-indexed Kripke models, of the
$\lambda\Lambda_{\kappa}$-calculus.

                    Nice, France, September 8-11, 1998
                     <http://www.inria.fr/concur98/>


Important dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Paper submissions:   March 18, 1998 (EXTENDED deadline)
   Notifications:       May 8, 1998
   Final versions:      June 10, 1998.


Venue and local arrangements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nice is ideally located on the French Riviera. September is still very
pleasant, while less crowded than the high season. Nice's
international airport is well-connected to all major european and
non-european cities.

Most likely the conference will be held at the auditorium of Nice
Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, which is conveniently located
in the heart of Nice, between the city center and the old town, and 20
minutes walk to the beach. The Museum is next to the Hotel Novotel,
where satellite workshops and registration will be held.

 
CONCUR 98: Purpose and Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory
of concurrency, and promote its applications. Interest in this
topic is continuously growing, as a consequence of the importance
 of concurrent systems and their applications, and of the scientific
relevance of their foundations.

The scope of CONCUR'98 covers all areas of semantics, logics, and
verification techniques for concurrent systems.  A list of specific
topics includes (but is not limited to) concurrency related aspects of
models of computation and semantic domains, process algebras, Petri
nets, event structures, real-time systems, hybrid systems,
decidability, model-checking, verification techniques, refinement
techniques, term and graph rewriting, distributed programming, logic
constraint programming, object-oriented programming, typing systems
and algorithms, case studies, tools and environments for programming
and verification.


Submissions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submissions should consist of a 100-200 word ASCII abstract and
summary (up to 15 pages, typeset 12 points; about 7000 words,
excluding bibliography and figures). Simultaneous submissions to other
conferences or journals are not allowed. Electronic submissions in
PostScript(tm) are strongly encouraged; instructions can be found at
the URL <http://www.inria.fr/concur98/submissions.html>, or can be
obtained by sending an email with subject "submission information" to
c98-subm@sophia.inria.fr. If surface mail is used, then five (5)
copies of the paper should be sent to the following address:
Concur'98, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, BP 93, F-06902 Sophia-Antipolis
Cedex, France.

We generalize the notion of nuclear maps from functional analysis by
defining nuclear ideals in tensored *-categories.  The motivation for
this study came from attempts to generalize the structure of the category
of relations to handle what might be called ``probabilistic relations''.
The compact closed structure associated with the category of relations 
does not generalize directly, instead one obtains nuclear ideals.

Most tensored *-categories have a large class of morphisms
which behave as if they were part of a compact closed category, i.e. they
allow one to transfer variables between the domain and the codomain.  We
introduce the notion of nuclear ideals to analyze these classes of
morphisms.  In compact closed categories, we see that all morphisms
are nuclear, and in the category of Hilbert spaces, the nuclear morphisms
are the Hilbert-Schmidt maps.

We also introduce two new examples of tensored *-categories, in which
integration plays the role of composition. In the first, morphisms are a 
special class of distributions, which we call tame distributions. 
We also introduce a category of probabilistic relations which was 
the original motivating example. 

Finally, we extend the recent work of Joyal, Street and Verity 
on traced monoidal categories to this setting by introducing the notion 
of a trace ideal. For a given symmetric monoidal category, it is not 
generally the case that arbitrary endomorphisms can be assigned a trace. 
However, we can find ideals in the category on which a trace can be 
defined satisfying equations analogous to those of Joyal, Street and 
Verity. We establish a close correspondence between nuclear ideals and 
trace ideals in a tensored *-category, suggested by the correspondence 
between Hilbert-Schmidt operators and trace operators on a Hilbert space. 
When we apply our notion of trace ideal to the category of Hilbert spaces, 
we obtain the usual trace of an endomorphism in the trace class.

ABSTRACT

In the present paper, we develop the notion of a trace operator
on a linearly distributive category, which amounts to essentially
working within a subcategory (the "core") which has the same sort of
"type degeneracy" as a compact closed category.  We also explore the
possibility that an object may have several trace structures,
introducing a notion of compatibility in this case.  We show that
if we restrict to compatible classes of trace operators, an object may
have at most one trace structure (for a given tensor structure). We give
a linearly distributive version of the "geometry of interaction"
construction, and verify that we obtain a linearly distributive category
in which traces become canonical. We explore the relationship between
our notions of trace and fixpoint operators, and show that an object
admits a fixpoint combinator precisely when it admits a trace and is
a cocommutative comonoid. This generalises an observation of Hyland and
Hasegawa.

This paper is presented to Bill Lawvere on the occasion of his 60th
birthday.
