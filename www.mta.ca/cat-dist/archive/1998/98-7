           *********   Second Announcement   *********

       The 68th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic
                       August 29-30, 1998 
                      Brno, Czech Republic



   The 68th meeting of the PSSL will be held at the Masaryk
University, Brno, Czech Republic over the weekend of 29-30
August 1998. It is organized in connection with the federated
conferences MFCS (Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science)
and CSL (Computer Science Logic) which are taking place in Brno
during August 23-28, 1998. There are other workshops related to
MFCS\CSL and participants interested to stay in Brno the whole
week may contact Jan Staudek (staudek@fi.muni.cz).
   As usual, the 68th meeting of the PSSL will be informal in
nature and it will be focused on category theory, logic and
theoretical computer science.
   We have arranged an accommodation in a student dormitory
(single rooms, for 2 nights since Friday to Sunday) together with
breakfasts and lunches in a university restaurant. The cost is 80$.
Participants wishing to stay in hotels should contact Jan Staudek.
   Brno is located about 200 km south-east of Prague and 130 km
north of Vienna and it can be reached from the both airports by
trains and buses. More details will be available in the last
announcement. We will maintain a www-page containing all
informations.
   To register, please fill out the form below and return it
(preferably by e-mail) to Jan Paseka till August 12.
   This deadline is important as afterwards we cannot guarantee 
an accommodation.
   Looking forward to meeting you in Brno.
                                  Jiri Rosicky and Jan Paseka

      Fragments: (1) Origin, I don't know, but surely cohomology
  is where it started. The term was used very early, 1937 I think,
  by Norman Steenrod in a paper mainly on universal coefficient
  theorems.
                  (2) The idea of putting forward some such
  guidelines was seriously discussed at La Jolla 1965, and I 
  should say that Sammy Eilenberg killed it single-handed. His
  main point was that anything we Americans might propose would
  be absolutely unacceptable in Paris. Verdier was the only
  Frenchman present; he was well thought of but very young.
                  (1 bis) Of course not covariant-contravariant.
                  (3) I'm not sure what "A mistake IMHO" means.
  Of course, the "co" in cofinal is genetically "con" of
  congress, concatenation. I don't have nice illustrations of
  antecedents of co-homology but it is not 'together' like in
  congress & concatenation. But it is dropped in categorical
  contexts because it is a distracting "co".

I would have thought that `co' in `cofinal' means `together with',
and didn't originally mean `opposite'. There are instances of
this meaning of `co' in, for example,  `coroutine'. And,
of course, `covariant', which is well established in 19th century
invariant theory, where it contrasts with `invariant'
(but I can't remember offhand a 19th cent. use of
`contravariant'). It would be very interesting to see a history
of this terminology.

Well, I am speculating here.  But FWIW, here goes.  Back in prehistory,
there were covariant and contravariant tensors.  Later on, came homology,
a word with impeccable credentials.  The dual was called cohomology, the
co- doubltess a shortening of contra-.  Very bad choice.  But that's the
way it came.  Peter Hilton pointed out that "homology" should be generic
with cohomology as the covariant version and contrahomology as the
contravariant one.  I think he wrote a book using "homology" and
"contrahomology", a kind of intermediate step.  Good idea, but hopeless,
really.  It reminds me of my pet peeve, which is the use of the horseshoe
for included-in-or-equal.  Thus destroying the analogy with <, as well as
requiring the idiotic horseshoe-plus-not-equal, which does not even appear
in the standard fonts.  So I never use the plain horseshoe for anything.
If everybody did that, then after one generation mathematicians could
start using the horseshoe for proper inclusion.  It will never happen.

As for which is which, that is a harder question.  If D is a diagram,
cone(-,D) is contravariant, but a representing object is called a limit of
D. But limit is covariant in D.  The opposite is true of cocones and
colimits.  Which one is right?  Hard to say?  I call a reflective
subcategory one whose inclusion has a left adjoint, but that has been
called coreflective (although probably not in recent years).  The co- in
cofinal has nothing to do (except perhaps very indirectly) with the one in
colimit.  I think it is like the co- in coordinate.  As such, I see
nothing wrong with final.  Or rather, I don't see that cofinal is any
improvement.  A family of objects in a category is weakly final (or weakly
terminal) if every object in the category has at least one arrow to at
least one object of said family.  Replace both "at least"s by "exactly"
and you have a final (or terminal) family and require the family to be
singleton and you have a final (or terminal) object.  So final ought to be
weakly final and similarly for cofinal, but I don't expect anyone's usage
will change.

I would guess that the oldest use of co- in mathematics is to mean
"complement of an angle", as in cosine, cotangent, etc.  Encyclopedia
Britannica dates these to 1635. This would be an early justification
of using co- in the sense of "opposite".

The word "complement" itself comes from Latin "complere": to fill up.

The use of co- in the sense of "together, joint" is much more
widespread in everyday language, in words such as coauthor and
coconspirator (notice how the last example is curiously redundant).
This is also the origin of words such as coordinate (1641),
coefficient (ca. 1715), and collinearity (1863).

Surely that is what Steenrod had in mind (subconsciously)?
Remember that covariant-contravariant for diff forms

   The Shorter OED is doubtless not an infallible
guide to mathematical etymology, but it has
something obvious that we have all been missing
(as far as I have seen yet):

    <2 {\it Math.} Short for {\it complement},
   in the sense 'of the complement' (as 
   {\it cosine}), or 'complement of' (as
   {\it co-latitude}).>

All categorical 'co's are surely that kind. In
prticular, cohomology like cosine. If Steenrod 
had in mind covariant, contravariant, why would 
he say 'cohomology'? Had he said 
'contrahomology' it would be clear. (It is
relevant, I think, that in Lefschetz' first
Colloquium book he called cohomology, such as
$H^1$, homology in negative dimensions, as
$H_{-1}$.)
   Cofinal has to be Latin 'cum'+final.

Of course the "co-" in "cofinal" is the Latin "cum", as it normally
is in English (if I refer to someone as my co-conspirator, I mean
he is conspiring with me, not against me!). But category-theorists
have got so firmly into the habit of using "co-" as an abbreviation
for "contra-" (except in the terms covariant and contravariant --
I assume they survived because they were widely used before categories
came along) that the "co-" in "cofinal" had to go. As for who killed
it off, the evidence points to Saunders Mac Lane as the guilty party
(see p. 213 of Categories for the Working Mathematician).

Category-theorists at least have the defence that the algebraic
topologists had started using "cohomology" for what should have been
"contrahomology" before categories came along. As Mike Barr mentioned,
Hilton and Wylie tried to encourage the use of "contrahomology" in
their book (1960), but it was probably far too late by then.

I'm surprised that no-one has yet mentioned Barry Mitchell's attempt,
in his book, to "eliminate the words left and right" from the language
of category theory. He did have a scheme for deciding which of a dual
pair of concepts should have the "co-"; unfortunately it led him to use
"adjoint" and "coadjoint" in the opposite sense to that in which most
people had been using them, and so much confusion resulted that everyone
went back to "left adjoint" and "right adjoint".

If it were possible to start afresh with the terminology of category
theory (of course it isn't, as Mike pointed out), I'd be in favour of
using "left" and "right" as much as possible, and eliminating the "co-"s.
(But even this is not guaranteed free from ambiguity. Has anyone apart
from me (and, I suppose, the authors) noticed that the usage of the
terms "left coset" and "right coset" in Mac Lane & Birkhoff's Algebra
is the opposite of that in Birkhoff & Mac Lane?)

   Well, the cosine makes a really beautiful story.

   Negative-dimensional chains are not in Lefschetz'
first Colloquium book, but his second. In 1942, so
the co- terminology did not sweep all before it.

   In Lefschetz' first Colloquium book cocycles are

       <pseudocycles>.

   In Steenrod's universal coefficient theorems (1936,
not 1937) cohomology is

       <dual homology>.

   Eilenberg-Steenrod 'Foundations' has a fairly
extensive historical note at the end of Chapter 1.
In particular, they credit 'co' to Whitney, Annals
39 (1938) 397-430 or so (397 is exact). Whitney has
a very brief history on p. 398, tracing the concept
to Alexander 1922, and mentioning a covariant tensor
in Alexander 1935. He says nothing of why he likes
co-.

P.S. -- I don't agree with John that "all categorical 'co-'s" 
are of the same kind as "cosine" or "colatitude" in referring to
something complementary (although I suppose that "cohomology"
might be). I can't see any sense in which the opposite of a
category can be regarded as complementary to it.

                       remark to coefficients, but when I
studied analytics in 1945, x was the abscissa and y the

I am certainly no linguist, but it seems obvious to me that in all
three cases, the prefix was attached before the word entered the
English language, and possibly even before the word acquired its
mathematical meaning. 

Coordinate: from Latin ordinare: to arrange, to put in order.
Coordinates are for "arranging" points in the plane, and they
do this jointly. Compare: coordination.

Coefficient: from Latin efficere: to affect, to produce an effect (?).
Coefficients are parameters that affect some quantity, and usually
there is more than one, so again, they do it jointly.

Does anyone know the actual origin of the word "covariant"? My guess
is that in the original context of tensors on manifolds, it is a
contraction of "coordinate invariant", that is, invariant under
transformations of coordinate systems. If this is true, then it fits
neither the "jointly" nor the "complement" nor the "dual" schemes.
Despite the fact that it came first historically, it would seem that
the word "covariant" is an exception to the otherwise (more or less)
consistent use of the prefix co- in category theory. If one were to
change terminology to eliminate this oddity, it would make little
sense to change the rule to accomodate the exception - rather, one
should rename "covariant" to something more logical like "provariant".

I doubt that it would be worth the effort -- especially since the word
"covariant" only ever seems to appear in parentheses.

Best, -- Peter

Dear collegues,

the following  preprint

"Computads for finitary monads on globular sets"

is available at

http://www-math.mpce.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/papers.html

>From  Introduction.

This work arose as a reflection on the foundation of higher
dimensional category theory. One of the main ingredients of any
proposed definition of weak $n$-category is the shape of diagrams
(pasting scheme) we
accept to be composable. In a globular approach \cite{Bat} each
$k$-cell
has a source and target  $(k-1)$-cell. In the opetopic approach of
Baez and Dolan \cite{BD} and the multitopic approach of Hermida,
Makkai
and Power \cite{HMP} each $k$-cell has a unique $(k-1)$-cell as
target
and a whole $(k-1)$-dimensional pasting diagram  as source.
In the theory of strict $n$-categories both source and target may be a
general pasting diagram \cite{J,StH, StP}.

 The globular approach
being the simplest one
seems too restrictive to describe the combinatorics of higher
dimensional compositions. Yet, we argue  that this is a false
impression. Moreover, we prove that this approach is a basic
one from which the other type of composable diagrams may be derived.
One  theorem proved here asserts that the category of algebras of
a finitary monad on the category of $n$-globular sets is {\bf
equivalent} to the category of algebras of an appropriate monad on
the
special category (of computads) constructed from the data of the
original monad. In the case of the monad derived from the universal
contractible operad \cite{Bat} this result may be interpreted as the
equivalence of the definitions of weak $n$-categories (in the sense
of \cite{Bat}) based on the
`globular' and general pasting diagrams. It may be also considered
 as the first step toward the proof of equivalence of the different
 definitions of weak $n$-category.


We also develop a general theory of computads and investigate some
properties of the category of generalized computads. It turned out,
that in a good situation this category is a topos (and even a presheaf
topos under some not very restrictive conditions, the property firstly
observed by S.Schanuel and reproved by A,Carboni and P.Johnstone for
$2$-computads in the sense of Street).

Not all lefts and rights are the same.  Left adjoint refers to the fact
that arrows FROM a value of the left adjoint into an object correspond to
arrows INTO the value of the right adjoint at that object.  Since English
is written left to right, Hom(A,B) means arrows from A to B, so in the
equation Hom(FA, B) = Hom(A,UB) the F winds up on the left side of the hom
set.  This is a natural name given the way we write our language, and so it
is not hard to reconstruct what the phrases left and right adjoint mean.

On the other hand the left and right in "left inverse" and "right inverse"
depend on the order in which we write composition, and that is independent
of the way we write our language.  I for one can never remember which is
which, a learning disability no doubt accounted for by the fact that I
worked on semigroups before I became a category theorist, leaving me
without a default way to write composition.  In any case, I would like
names such as retraction and split.

I seem to remember  the "ordinate" (=y) and "abscissa" (=x) as making
up the cartesian "co-ordinate<italic>s </italic>" of the point (x,y).
"co-efficient" probably comes from terminology for polynomials, with
the "co-" coming from the fact that it was always atttached to a power
of x. And while we are on this we shouldn't forget "direct" and
"inverse" and "inductive" and "projective" limits! It took category
theory (and Mac Lane) to make sense of all of this.

Well, after reading the various replies, I concede that I was very likely
wrong about cohomolohy (which is generally accepted as the first co-)
being short for contra-homology.  Therefore, complementary homology seems
the best.  Then people started thinking of it as covariant homology
anyway.  Then the idea took hold that co-meant opposite.  Strange, since
now it has essentially reversed meaning.  That's how the language
developes.  It is through such twists and turns that the same
Indo-european root come to mean black in English and white in French (and
other romance languages).  

A few other comments.  The x- and y-coordinates are (or used to be) called
ordinate and abscissa (or vice versa).  For what it's worth.  I know what
efficient means, but I have no idea what it has to do with coefficient.
It stands to reason that Birkhoff & Mac Lane is the opposite of Mac Lane &
Birkhoff.  I hadn't noticed that, but I sure had noticed that I had no
simple way of recalling which were left and which were right cosets.  And
would products be left limits or right limits and why?

I seem to have started an avalanche.

There seem to be two contradictory theories - maybe someone 
could make the codictory.

1. co- versus nothing, from trigonometry
2. co- versus contra-

I knew the words covariant and contravariant both before I knew anything
about categories, and from a book which predated (sorry, pre-dated)
category theory, namely
	A.S. Eddington's "Mathematical Theory of Relativity" (1925),
which was the only serious maths book I could find in the town library
in High Wycombe (half way between London and Oxford) when I was at
school.  What it was doing there, I can't imagine.

As to "cofinal", I worked out its etymology for myself, but Saunders
Mac Lane (if he was in fact the culprit) could have re-invented its
etymology instead of generating the confusion.  Besides, (co)final
functors are those between diagram-shapes which give rise to the same
colimits, so the prefix seems reasonable to me.

Peter's book "Stone spaces" (CUP 1982) studies many categories that
obey the rule that the signature of the opposite of C is the complement
of the signature of C, with respect to both existence and direction
of sup's and inf's of cardinalities 0, finite nonzero, and infinite.
Namely, if sup's of a given arity exist in C then inf's of that arity
do not exist in C^op, and conversely (at least in the examples).

The extremal pair of opposite categories in this regard are CABA,
complete atomic Boolean algebras, which has all inf's and sup's, dual to
Set having none (but for this purpose we could as well take StoneDLat,
dual to Poset).  "In the middle" is CSLat, complete semilattices,
having sup's of all cardinalities and no inf's, dual to itself via a
duality that interchanges sup's and inf's (not to be confused with the
equivalence that performs this interchange).

Top and bottom as zeroary sup and inf can be moved independently from
CABA to Set to give pointed and bipointed sets dual to CABA's lacking
one or both constants 0 and 1.

Likewise binary (and hence ternary etc.) sup and/or inf can be moved from
CABA to Set.  Moving all finitary sup's for example turns Set into SLat
(semilattices, specifically of the meet kind) and CABA into StoneSLat,
aka algebraic lattices.

By viewing Stone topology as the manifestation of infinite sup's and
inf's, the duality of Stone (Stone spaces) and Bool (Boolean algebras)
can be understood as the migration of the infinitary sup's and inf's
of CABA to Set, turning CABA into Bool and Set into Stone.  From this
viewpoint the ability to present limits in Top follows by duality from
the optional removal in CABA of infinitary inf's to yield Top^op, while
Frm (frames) as Loc^op (locales) tightens this up by removing "optional".

Chu(Set,2) provides a uniform setting for this rule.  All the above
categories C have a "common" full concrete embedding in Chu(Set,2)
in which the points remain unchanged (concreteness) while the states
or opens are taken to be the morphisms of C to the realization of the
schizophrenic object 2 as an object of C.  In this setting the above
tendency (but not the converse part) can be made a theorem about Chu
spaces over 2 as follows, at least for the finitary operations.

Theorem 0: If a space A has constant 0 then its dual A\perp does not
have constant 1 (and dually with 0 and 1 interchanged).

Proof.  A row of all 0's precludes a column of all 1's (the impossibility
of having an irresistible force and an immovable object).

Theorem 2: If A has all binary joins then the only binary meets existing
in A\perp are of comparable elements.

Proof.  Suppose x,y are incomparable columns of A (points of A\perp)
whose meet x&y is a column of A.  Then there exist rows a,b of A such that

	     x  y  x&y
	a    0  1   0
	b    1  0   0

is part of A's matrix.  Now form the join of a and b:

       a|b   1  1   0

This contradicts x&y being the meet of x and y.  QED

(Apropos of the comparability issue, note that the category of finite
chains with bottom, with morphisms all monotone bottom-preserving
functions, is self-dual.)

I don't know how to state the corresponding theorem if any for infinitary
sup's and inf's.  And I have no idea how to generalize all this to
Chu(Set,3) and beyond.

I became aware of this complementarity principle for opposite categories
around 1990, and contemplating it led my student Vineet Gupta and myself
to (ordinary) Chu spaces in 1992, at which point we learned that they
were not new (but not well known).

While our insecurities about "co-" are being aired, I thought I should
admit to even more worries in the case of 2-categories (or bicategories)!
In these terminological matters, I have given up on linguistic correctness
and have also almost given up worrying about mathematical consistency.

Here is the difficulty. Motivation for 2-category theory comes from (at
least) two different directions which often lead to the same basic concepts
yet with different suggestions for terminology for the three other dual
concepts. Each concept has a co-, op-, and coop-version but the good choice
of op or co is not clear at all.

First motivation: We can take the view that our 2-category is foremost a
category with the 2-cells as extra structure (like homotopies in Top).
Then, for example, as pointed out by John Gray in the La Jolla 1965 volume,
Grothendieck was wrong in using "cofibration" for the *2-cell*-reversing
dual of fibration. Compare the situation in  Top  where cofibrations are
the *arrow*-reversing dual of fibrations.  So this leads to "opfibration"
for the *2-cell*-reversing dual of "fibration" (this is unnecessary in  Top
since homotopies are invertible).  However, Grothendieck's terminology has
stuck in some literature.  Using this first motivation, we define products
and coproducts of objects in a 2-category as we would in a category plus an
extra 2-cell condition.

Second motivation: We think of our 2-category  K  as a place to develop
category theory so that arrows f : U --> A  into an object  A  of  K  are
thought of as generalised objects of  A,  and 2-cells into  A  are
generalised arrows of  A.  Take a notion such as monad on  A.  From this
motivation, reversing *2-cells* in  K,  we should get the notion of
"comonad".  This terminology is in conflict with the doctrine developed on
the basis of the first motivation. Of course, "monad" is invariant under
*arrow*-reversal, but there are other concepts which are not.

A category is called " left " if it has a strict initial object and any map
with an initial domain is regular (in the general sense). The opposite of a
left category is called a " right " category. The key fact here is that a left
category is never right unless it is trivial (i.e. any map is an isomorphism).
Since may natural categories are either left or right, this enable us to
introduce the "relative version" of a categorical concept with a dual. The
following short note

A category is called " left " if it has a strict initial object and any
map with an initial domain is regular (in the general sense). The opposite
of a left category is called a " right " category. The key fact here is
that a left category is never right unless it is trivial (i.e. any map
is an isomorphism). Since may natural categories are either left or right,
this enable us to introduce the "relative version" of a categorical concept
with a dual. The following short note

<P>On Left and Right Categories

<P>is available at

<P><A HREF="http://www.azd.com/lrcat.html">www.azd.com/lrcat.html</A>

<P>which is inspired by Vaughan Pratt comments:

<BR>>I can't see any sense in which the opposite of a
<BR>>category can be regarded as complementary to it.

<P>Peter's book "Stone spaces" (CUP 1982) studies many categories that
<BR>obey the rule that the signature of the opposite of C is the complement
<BR>of the signature of C, with respect to both existence and direction
<BR>of sup's and inf's of cardinalities 0, finite nonzero, and infinite.
<BR>Namely, if sup's of a given arity exist in C then inf's of that arity
<BR>do not exist in C^op, and conversely (at least in the examples).

<P>The extremal pair of opposite categories in this regard are CABA,
<BR>complete atomic Boolean algebras, which has all inf's and sup's, dual
to
<BR>Set having none (but for this purpose we could as well take StoneDLat,
<BR>dual to Poset).&nbsp; "In the middle" is CSLat, complete semilattices,
<BR>having sup's of all cardinalities and no inf's, dual to itself via
a
<BR>duality that interchanges sup's and inf's (not to be confused with
the
<BR>equivalence that performs this interchange).

<P>Top and bottom as zeroary sup and inf can be moved independently from
<BR>CABA to Set to give pointed and bipointed sets dual to CABA's lacking
<BR>one or both constants 0 and 1.

<P>Likewise binary (and hence ternary etc.) sup and/or inf can be moved
from
<BR>CABA to Set.&nbsp; Moving all finitary sup's for example turns Set
into SLat
<BR>(semilattices, specifically of the meet kind) and CABA into StoneSLat,
<BR>aka algebraic lattices.

<P>By viewing Stone topology as the manifestation of infinite sup's and
<BR>inf's, the duality of Stone (Stone spaces) and Bool (Boolean algebras)
<BR>can be understood as the migration of the infinitary sup's and inf's
<BR>of CABA to Set, turning CABA into Bool and Set into Stone.&nbsp; From
this
<BR>viewpoint the ability to present limits in Top follows by duality from
<BR>the optional removal in CABA of infinitary inf's to yield Top^op, while
<BR>Frm (frames) as Loc^op (locales) tightens this up by removing "optional".

<P>Chu(Set,2) provides a uniform setting for this rule.&nbsp; All the above
<BR>categories C have a "common" full concrete embedding in Chu(Set,2)
<BR>in which the points remain unchanged (concreteness) while the states
<BR>or opens are taken to be the morphisms of C to the realization of the
<BR>schizophrenic object 2 as an object of C.&nbsp; In this setting the
above
<BR>tendency (but not the converse part) can be made a theorem about Chu
<BR>spaces over 2 as follows, at least for the finitary operations.

<P>Theorem 0: If a space A has constant 0 then its dual A\perp does not
<BR>have constant 1 (and dually with 0 and 1 interchanged).

<P>Proof.&nbsp; A row of all 0's precludes a column of all 1's (the impossibility
<BR>of having an irresistible force and an immovable object).

<P>Theorem 2: If A has all binary joins then the only binary meets existing
<BR>in A\perp are of comparable elements.

<P>Proof.&nbsp; Suppose x,y are incomparable columns of A (points of A\perp)
<BR>whose meet x&amp;y is a column of A.&nbsp; Then there exist rows a,b
of A such that

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
x&nbsp; y&nbsp; x&amp;y
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;
1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;
0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0

<P>is part of A's matrix.&nbsp; Now form the join of a and b:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a|b&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;
0

<P>This contradicts x&amp;y being the meet of x and y.&nbsp; QED

<P>(Apropos of the comparability issue, note that the category of finite
<BR>chains with bottom, with morphisms all monotone bottom-preserving
<BR>functions, is self-dual.)

<P>I don't know how to state the corresponding theorem if any for infinitary
<BR>sup's and inf's.&nbsp; And I have no idea how to generalize all this
to
<BR>Chu(Set,3) and beyond.

<P>I became aware of this complementarity principle for opposite categories
<BR>around 1990, and contemplating it led my student Vineet Gupta and myself
<BR>to (ordinary) Chu spaces in 1992, at which point we learned that they
<BR>were not new (but not well known).

Ross Street brought up an important point.  As you start considering
higher-dimensional categories, the number of possible dualizations
rises exponentially.  Also, given a monoidal category V, we can consider
it either as a bicategory with trivial hom-categories, or as a
one-object bicategory (usually called the suspension of V).  Which of
these views should be "notationally invariant"?  Should colimits in Set
be oplimits in the supension of Set? 

Best regards,

-- J"urgen

P.S.  Why are certain categorical notions preferred over their dual
counterparts?  E.g., hardly anyone talks about the Yoneda embedding
of A into [A,Set]^op.

The number of submissions to xxx.lanl.gov seems more driven by culture
than anything else.  The following are the number of submissions for
1998 to date:

	Astrophysics: 		2225
	Condensed Matter	2272
	  + 10 more physics areas
	Mathematics (total)	932
	Computation & Language	48

Evidently very few computer scientists think to submit to xxx.lanl.gov.
I wouldn't infer from those numbers that computer science is not
flourishing or publishing.

As far as algebraic geometry vs category theory goes, the most recent
5 submissions in those respective areas span 1 week vs. 11 weeks,
suggesting that the recent rate of submissions is closer to 11:1 than
221:1.  (I'd have taken a larger sample if one had been as handy as the
most-recent-5 statistic.)

There is 1 with primary category CT and 7 cross-listed into CT in
1998.  A second CT paper dated 1995 is from the migration of the MSRI
preprint series.  Jim's table, which was forwarded from xxx staff,
counts only primary submissions, to avoid double-counting.  You can get a
clear picture at

    http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CT

I should say that the main consequences so far of creating CT has been
a lot of theorizing about the categories in the xxx mathematics archive.
Perhaps that's a natural response from category theorists, but it's not
what the people who created CT had in mind.

One point of my old (alas still unpublished) remarks "Sur les choix de variance

forms  A ---> [A,Set]^op  -- and  A ---> [A^op, Set]  -- but no others (!).

Although this might indeed well be true, isn't is a bit too simplistic to
measure the succes of a subject this way?

I think that for a more balanced view it is useful to consider the
following points:
1. CT is a new subject class, and naturally has lower traffic than the
well established ones,
2. There are cross references to CT from other classes,
3. There are papers containing some category theory classified under
other classes; some of these could well have been classified CT (remember
that the author determines the subject class!),
4. The position of Category Theory in Mathematics is quite different from
Algebraic Geometry's (more marginal??),
5. The categorical community is relatively small, so categorists might
be thinking they don't need a preprint archive,
6. Category Theory is less "time-sensitive" than other subjects, so
categorists don't rush off to get their preprints time-stamped (as I
have heard rumoured is the practice among (mathematical) physicists),
7. And there's the compulsory-tex-source-submission issue ...

Mildly apropos of this, the two maps can be rolled into one, in a sense,
to give the "bi-Yoneda embedding" F:C->Chu(Set,|C|) that I presented at
the Barrfest, where |C| denotes the set of arrows of C.

This embedding represents each object b of C as the Chu space F(b) =
(A,r,X), r:AxX->K, where A is the set of arrows f:a->b over all a,
X is the set of arrows h:b->c over all c, and r(f,h) = hf.

Each morphism g:b->b' is represented as the pair F(g) = (j,k) of functions
j:F_A(b)->F_A(b'), k:F_X(b')->F_X(b) defined by j(f) = gf, k(h) = hg
for each point f:a->b in F_A(b) and state h:b'->c in F_X(b').  (j,k) is
a Chu transform (= continuous, = satisfies the adjointness condition).

F is full, faithful, concrete with respect to U:C->Set defined by U(b)
{f:a->b} ("left" Yoneda), and co-concrete with respect to V:C->Set^op
defined by V(b) = {h:b->c} ("right" Yoneda) (or the other way round
depending on which way you're facing).

Regrettably this didn't go in the proceedings, being already committed
to TCS.

This division of categories into left, right, and other caters for only
a very special case of the general phenomenon "signature of opposite is
complement of signature", namely where *all* the algebra is on the right,
call this C\op.  The more general situation permits the algebra to be
split between C and C\op, e.g. CSLat which puts the sups (say) in C and
sends the infs off to C\op, which turn into sups as they "pass through
the mirror."  Many other partitions of algebra are possible that similarly
do not fit this left-right classification and so fall under "other".

Jim, 
   There is something wrong (probably internal at
xxx.lanl.gov) with your table of '98 abstracts in
various branches of math. I went there (for the
first time, thanks for the address) and clicked
on Category Theory and found 5 abstracts. Those
were all from the 3 months preceding this month,
so I thought there should be more in '98. I did
a search for the words 'category theory',
limited to '98, and got 8 abstracts. However,
more than half of those were classified,
primarily, as Quantum Groups or something. So
God only knows how many CT's there are in lanl
in '98, but not less than 5.

 In mathematics many structures  are named 
after some one's name. For example, Boolean 
algebra, Hermitian matrices, Hausdorff 
space, Euclidean space. The first letters of 
the person's name are usually in upper case. 
The only exception I have seen are the 
abelian group and sober space. Does any one 
know why these two cases are different from 
others?

> In mathematics many structures  are named after some one's name.

A questionable practice in many cases, and not necessarily complimentary
to the person concerned.  For example, G. H. Hardy is famous in genetics
for a rather trivial lemma in Bayesian statistics which was his answer
to a question over High Table lunch in Trinity one day.  How on earth is
anyone meant to know what might be meant by "Gauss's Lemma/Theorem/etc"?

On the other hand, things can be knocked off inappropriate pedestals by
giving them eponymous names.  For example, what others call "simple type
theory" or "higher order intuitionistic logic" I call "Zermelo type theory"
in my book.  This has certainly given me a more balanced view of its
(limited) importance in mathematics, and I hope to have the same effect
on my readers.

Given that you're doing it, whether to use a capital depends on national
and linguistic custom. The German phrase "hilbertische Raum" looks very
peculiar to me, for example.  I was brought up to give people capital
letters, whether they're nouns or adjectives.  I tend *not* to do this
if it seems to me that usage of the word has strayed rather a long way
from what the person in question actually did, for example "cartesian
transformation" for a natural transformation whose naturality squares
are pullbacks.

Peter Freyd, who of course comes from a different culture from me, will
probably tell you his views.

First off, sober (or sobre) is not an eponym (the fancy name for these).
I often write boolean, hausdorff, and euclidean.  You sometimes see
Abelian.  So there are no standards.  Note that boolean, euclidean and
abelian have adjectival endings (as does Hermitian), while hausdorff does
not.  In French and German, the two other languages I know somewhat, it is
standard that all adjectives be in lower case, that is not so in English.
So it comes down to a matter of convention and, basically, familiarity.
In physics, it is considered a mark of great respect to achieve lower case
status.  Nearly all physical constants and units are lower case.  But
mathematicians do not accept standards conventions and journals make no
attempt to enforce uniformity in these matters.

Atomic Categories

Zhaohua Luo

Abstract:

Let C be a category with a strict initial object 0. A map is called
"non-initial" if its domain is not an initial object. A non-initial
object T is called "unisimple" if for any two non-initial maps f: X -->
T and g: Y --> T there are non-initial maps r: R --> X and s: R --> Y
such that fr = gs. We say that C is an "atomic category" if any
non-initial object is the codomain of a map with a unisimple domain.
Many natural (left) categories arising in geometry are atomic (such as
the categories of sets, topological spaces, posets, coherent spaces,
Stone spaces, schemes, local ringed spaces, etc.) In this short note we
show that each atomic category carries a unique functor to the category
of sets, which plays the traditional role of "underlying functor" in
categorical geometry

Actually, many people write Abelian group and some people write cartesian
product.  I have seen boolean algebra, too.

Sober spaces are not named after a person.  A sober space is a topological
space in which every closed subspace that is not the union of proper closed
subspaces is the closure of exactly one point.  If you are sober then what
you see is really there and you don't see double!

I heard someone give this explanation at a meeting but I don't know its
history.

Just a brief comment concerning Paul's recent posting.
I don't know in which German text he found "hilbertischer Raum",
it has at least one mistake in it! Usually one says Hilbertraum,
like Banachraum, Frechetraum, etc. Also possible is Hilbertscher Raum
(without "i" after t), and hilbertscher Raum may also be acceptable.
As far as I remember (I have no relevant reference book at hand at my
current location), the rule for making out of a name an adjective by
adding sch (and the appropriate e, er - depending on declention) is
to keep the capital of the name, unless the term has become absolutely
standard (like abelsche Gruppe); to use the lower case is then regarded
as an honour to the person in question (Abel).
No more linguistics - Cheers,
Walter.

	Njectural answer: anybody who doesn't want the ncept to be nfused
with "cofinal" in the topological sense, which is surely an older usage.

Fred Linton explains the term sober space this way:
if you haven't been drinking you don't see double
(so you don't want any pair of points belonging to
the same set of open sets) and you certainly don't
see any pink elements (irreducible closed sets
with no generic point).

I can't claim the credit either: the wording above is mine, but I 
copied the idea from something written by Bill Lawvere. I can't now
find the reference, but I think it may have been in his 1976 Chicago
lecture notes on "Variable Sets, Etendu and Variable Structures in
Topoi" (of which I no longer have a copy).

I can't claim the credit either: the wording above is mine, but I 
copied the idea from something written by Bill Lawvere. I can't now
find the reference, but I think it may have been in his 1976 Chicago
lecture notes on "Variable Sets, Etendu and Variable Structures in
Topoi" (of which I no longer have a copy).

Uniform Functors

Zhaohua Luo

Abstract:

In a previous note [atomic categories] we introduced the notion of an
atomic category, and showed that each atomic category C carries a
canonical functor  to the category of sets, called the unifunctor of C.
We also introduced the notion of a uniform functor between atomic
categories. In this note we give an intrinsic definition of a uniform
functor between any two categories with strict initials. Roughly
speaking a functor is uniform if it induces isomorphisms between the
complete boolean algebras of normal sieves on the objects. We show that
any uniform functor to the category of sets is unique up to equivalence.
A functor between Grothendieck toposes is uniform iff it induces an
isomorphism between the complete boolean algebras of complemented
subobjects. Since any unifunctor is uniform, this implies that a
Grothendieck topos is atomic iff the complete boolean algebra of
complemented subobjects of each object is atomic (or equivalently, there
is a uniform functor to the category of sets).

To all experts in algebraic topology:

Is the duality I describe below known?  It does not appear to be
Poincare duality since there is no separate treatment of the torsion and
torsion free parts.  Let S be a simplicial complex, that is a set of
faces of an N simplex closed under face operations.  For what I am about
to say, it is necessary that the empty face in dimension -1 be included
so that the (co-)homology will be reduced.  This means, for example,
that there is a distinction between the empty simplicial complex (which
has no homology) and the simplicial complex consisting of only the empty
set (which has one cyclic homology group in degree -1).  In fact, the
former is dual to the N simplex and the latter to the N sphere.

Let S' be defined as the set of complements of the complement of S.
That is, for each simplex sigma not in S, the complementary simplex,
whose vertices are those not in sigma, belongs to S' (and nothing else).
Then for i = -1,...,N, the ith homology of S is the N-i-1st cohomology
of S'.

The algebraic topology books I have looked at do not mention Poincare
duality, except for Lefschetz, written in 1940, and he uses a complex
different from S'; in fact just opposite poset to S, since he is doing
things in the generality of an arbitrary poset equipped with "incidence
numbers" that are used in defining the boundary operator.  In
particular, his dual has the same number of elements as S, rather than
2^{N+1} - that number.

One thing I find curious is that although this gives, essentially, the
cohomology of S, there is no obvious way of making that into a
contravariant functor.

I have a real question now.  Suppose S is a simplicial complex of
dimension n with the property that every n-1 face of every n simplex is
a face of at least two n simplexes.  I want to conclude that H_n(S) is
non-zero.  Assume that the union of the n simplexes is connected (any
connected component would inherit the hypothesis).  Then it seems clear
geometrically that the union of the faces would enclose one or more
holes, but I don't see how to actually prove this.  The space would
appear to have no boundary, but it also is not a manifold since a point
in one of the faces could have a branched neighborhood.

Dear Mike,
   You are asking for every strongly connected (finite)
n-complex to have nonzero $H_n$, which I think you can
find -- if your Russian suffices -- in P. S. Alexandrov
Combinatorial Topology, OGIZ, 1947 (660 pp.) [MR 10,
55b]. It should be around Chapter 14 or 15. I have 
never tried to go that far in the book, nor to read the
Russian at all. I have long owned, and have used as
texts in classes, the English translations which go to
Chapter 12 I think; Graylock, Rochester, vol. 1, 1956
[MR 17, 882a] and vol. 2, 1957 [MR 19, 759a]. With any
luck you will strike an algebraic topologist who can
give you an English reference.
   Yours,  John

Recent mention of sober spaces brought to mind memories of Alfred Philpott
Sober, whose sad death from liver failure five years ago ended a long
career in topology. Though largely unpublished, it was his work that
underlay the notion of what are now known as sober spaces.

In Sober's view, points of topological spaces are essentially blurred and
hazy: however hard you try to focus on them they always seem to jiggle
about a bit - to him "focusing on a point" meant to find it within some
_open_ neighbourhood, and these almost always left some room for manoeuvre.
He understood the points to be exactly their open neighbourhood filters,
and the spaces that would now be called non-sober were trying to impose an
over-clear view of reality, making artificial distinctions between what was
actually the same thing or trying to deny the existence of something he
could see with his own eyes.

On the related subject of continuity, he saw its essence as that of a
function was that was not unduly upset by this jiggling: as long as the
argument didn't jiggle too much, the result wouldn't either, and he liked
to demonstrate the idea by carrying a tray of drinks across a crowded room.

Though not one of the founders of locale theory, he was aware of the idea
and greatly sympathetic to it - though he couldn't see any reason for using
the French spelling and pronunciation. Once when in the midst of explaining
his ideas the lattice structures started to become manifest and he would
excitedly talk about "getting down to the local".

He studied initially at Cambridge under the influence of Charles Wells (the
Bedford Charles Wells, NOT the well-known category theorist) and his
thesis, starting off on Klein bottles, soon took in Gross bottles too. He
made his academic home in the University of Portsmouth and was much loved
by both his colleagues and his students for his parties and for his
never-failing warm welcome "Come in and what'll you have?" He is much
missed by all who knew him.

Steve Vickers.

I've got well over a thousand e-mails waiting to be looked at. I'm
working on the pile from both ends. Two recent postings from Mike 
Barr:


1) The duality he describes sounds like Spanier-Whitehead duality.
It's usually defined geometrically. Embed a finite complex into a
higher-dimensional sphere, take the complement, contract it to a
finite complex. Do this in the stable-homotopy category (obtained by
forcing the suspension functor on the homotopy category to become an
automorphism) and normalize the dimensions so that the dual of a space
has the negative of its dimension. Show that the embeddings can be
chosen in a coherent fashion to obtain a self-duality for stable
homotopy. (The last step is non-trivial and the only person I know who
verified it is Frank Adams, and that wasn't published. Does anyone
have a citation?)


2) If every  n-1  cell of an n-dimensional finite complex is the face 
of _exactly_  2  n-dimensional cells then there's a fairly easy 
argument that the n-dimensional  Z_2 cohomology is non-trivial. But if 
the condition is changed to "_at least_  2  n-dimensional cells" then 
the space can be contractible.

Start with the closed unit disk in the complex plane and glue the 
boundary onto the closed unit interval (which constitutes half of the
intersection of the disk and the real line) by identifying  a point  x
on the interval with  e^(2(pi)xi)  on the boundary. If one 
triangulates this space, each edge will be a face of either 2 or 3
triangles. 

One way of seeing that this is contractible is to consider first the 
space obtained by identifying just the upper half of the boundary with
the unit interval by identifying  a point  x  on the interval with
e^((pi)xi)  on the boundary. Recalling that the homotopy type of a 
space is unchanged when reasonable closed contractible subsets are 
collapsed to points, note that if the lower half of the boundary is 
collapsed to a point we obtain the first space. On the other hand, the
upper half (together with the unit interval) is contractible, and when
it's collapsed to a point we obtain the unit disk.

By taking the suspension of this example we can get an example in 
every larger finite dimension.

This example is a mapping cone. Take the map from the circle to the
circle that wraps the first third of the circle around the circle,
wraps the second third around in the opposite direction, and the 
last third in the original direction. This map is, of course, 
homotopic to the identity map. The mapping-cone construction depends
only on the homotopy type of the map. The mapping cone of the
identity map on the circle is, of course, the disk.

I got the same counter-example from Peter Johnstone and Peter Freyd.  PJ
called it the dunce cap and described it as a triangle with the three
edges identified, one in the reverse direction.  PF described it in a more
complicated way that made it easier to see it actually contractible.  And
the latter was really what I wanted to refute.  When I saw PJ's example, I
mistakenly thought it still had a 1-cycle.  

The smallest triangulation I found had 8 vertices, which is still too
large to compute by hand with.  The dual complex still has over 200
simplexes and that is just too many.  If anyone knows a smaller
triangulation, I would like to know it.  

Thanks to all who responded.

Michael

EXPONENTIABILITY AND SINGLE UNIVERSES
by Marta BUNGE and Susan NIEFIELD

ABSTRACT - In this paper, we first consider known universes for pairs of
opposite notions such as those of discrete fibrations/discrete
opfibrations and of open/closed locale inclusions, and then extrapolate
these in order to introduce new single universes for open/closed
inclusions of subcategories and for functions/distributions on a topos.  A
key factor that these notions have in common is exponentiability in the
ambient category.  Along the way, we (1) prove that, for a factorization
linearly ordered small category B, the category of discrete
Giraud-Conduche fibrations over B is a (model generated) topos, (2)
characterize locally closed inclusions in the category Cat of small
categories, (3) investigate ``generalized coverings'' in topos theory,
including branched coverings, cuts, and complete spreads, and (4) examine
the preservations of exponetiability under the passage from Cat/B to the
category of Grothendieck toposes over the presheaves PB.

About two months ago I announced a workshop on formal
underpinnings of Java. Since then I've had email from Java
Software at Sun (what used to be called Javasoft) expressing
interest.

They said:
Our main interest is in formal specification of Java byte code
verification because that is an area where a formal spec is both realistic
and sorely needed. We hope to be able to adapt some approach developed in
the research community. 

If you are doing work in this or related work there is still
time to submit an extended abstract to our workshop.

Formal Underpinnings of Java - an OOPSLA'98 Workshop

Important Dates   
Submissions:      31 July 1998   
Notifications:    20 August 1998   
Final Versions:   20 September 1998   
Workshop:         Sunday, 18 October 1998,  Vancouver,
Canada
    
Java offers a novel paradigm for program deployment. It supports
intermediate code that is dynamically loaded from remote sites - sometimes
without the user's knowledge. For Web pages, Java applets can greatly
improve interactivity; for Java developers, the Java paradigm promises
benefits in portability and manageability. However, the Java paradigm also
opens new possibilities for abuse and has caused concern about security.
    
The application of formal methods to the Java paradigm aims to provide a
better understanding of the approach by rigorously formulating and trying
to prove the soundness of binary compatibility, type safety, security and
other guarantees made by Java. It also aims to provide some guidance for
further development of the paradigm by uncovering possible design flaws
and by supplying a platform for the description of future extensions.
    
This workshop aims to bring together researchers to share new ideas and
results.  Since the main focus in selecting workshop contributions will be
the intrinsic interest and timeliness of the work, authors are encouraged
to submit (polished) descriptions of work in progress as well as papers
describing completed projects. The proceedings will be published as a
Princeton University technical report and be available from the web.  We
solicit submissions on original research on the following, or related
subjects:
      semantics of Java 
      semantics of byte code, correctness of the byte code
verifier 
      formal verification of Java programs 
      separate compilation, binary compatibility 
      dynamic linking and loading 
      security policy 
      practicality of formal methods for Java 
      comparison of  approaches, tools 

Electronic versions of extended abstracts between 2500 and5000 words
(approximately 5-10 pages) should be e-mailed to 
S.Eisenbach@doc.ic.ac.uk 
by Friday, 31 July 1998, using US-letter or A4 size,Postscript or PDF. 
The submission may be included inline in the message or as a MIME
attachment only. (If electronic submission is impossible, postal
submissions must be received by Friday 31 July 1998; enclose 4
double-sided copies, a return postal address, a phone number, and a return
e-mail address.)  Receipt of the submissions will be acknowledged by
e-mail. The authors should inquire in case a prompt acknowledgment is not
received.
