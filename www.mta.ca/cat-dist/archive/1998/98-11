Dear Ralph,

thank you for taking an interest in the FISh performance results for
quicksort. You raise two basic questions. Is the FISh program faster?
If so, why?


Is quicksort in FISh faster than qsort (on arrays of doubles)? 
==============================================================


> (1) Your C code compares using two floating point operations 
>(subtraction, compare), while the fish program uses just one (no 
>subtraction).


This makes a small difference to the overall performance of the
algorithm.  I re-ran the test for qsort with the following comparison
function

int comp(const void *i, const void *j) {
return (*(double*)i > *(double*)j ) ;
}

that has only one operation. The C results are better by about 10% but
FISh is still twice as fast.

	C benchmark1 	C benchmark2 	FISh benchmark

	3.59		3.35		1.65

>(3) The C library qsort takes a three-valued comparison function, 
>while your fish code uses a two-valued comparison.

I'm not sure what point you're making. The designers of qsort had a
free choice. I suspect that the three-valued comparison is used to
exploit equality of values, to obtain greater efficiency. In any
event, it is unlikely to make much difference in the light of (1)
above. 

Conclusion: The FISh program *is* faster. 


Why is quicksort in FISh faster?
=================================

>(4) As you note, your fish code gets optimised by specialising to the
>datatype and comparison function used.  


Yes. This is a given. The question is to pinpoint the source of the
speedup.


> ... This is the main 
>performance issue, and has nothing to do with boxing/unboxing issues.


Point taken. The data supplied to quicksort is not boxed, but this is
because (the length of the array and) the size of the array entries
are given as explicit parameters. In this sense qsort is *not*
polymorphic in its choice of data type. If it were not provided by
the C programmer then boxing would add another layer of indirection to
the program. Such information about the size of entries etc. is
inferred by the FISh compiler.

>... Whether [FISh is faster] will depend on 
>things like instruction scheduling in the compiler & CPU, & register 
>allocation in the caller & in any case the difference will be tiny.


Your conclusion does not match the performance figures above.

The FISh program avoids making a function call at all.  That is,
instead of passing the addresses to a function, a primitive comparison
is made. The key point is that this can only be done because
information like the length of the array and the size of the entries
(in bytes) can be inferred by the FISh compiler, instead of being
supplied by the user.


Yours,
Barry Jay

The result that finite products coincide with finite coproducts in

Warning: there's no category theory in this letter - it's purely a
reponse to the discussion of execution speed of FISh quicksort.

Barry Jay wrote:
> Why is quicksort in FISh faster?
> =================================

I would like to propose another reason the FISh quicksort appears to be
faster than the library qsort - they aren't the same algorithm.  In
particular, the standard library qsort and the FISh sort are using
different methods to pick the pivot.

Choice of pivot in quicksort is important to ensure the worst case
doesn't degenerate to O(n^2).  The choice of pivot in the FISh code
is always the first element, which does give very poor performance
in the case the array is already sorted.  I'm not sure what the qsort
in the libc i have here does.  However, typical tricks include selecting
the median of three elements at the bottom, middle and top of the array,
choosing a random element, choosing the median of three random elements,
and so on.  Importantly, each of these choices requires some work,
and thus negatively impacts on the average speed of the sort in order to
alleviate the worst case speed.

Caveat: I'm not a professional benchmarker/tester, and the tests below
are probably very flawed.  I have tried to give details on everything
that seems relevant, but your mileage may vary.  This data is more given
to suggest an alternative, plausible explanation for the observed speed
difference in the FISh and C benchmarks, than to claim i have identified
all the issues in the timing results found for FISh and C quicksort.

To test this hypothesis, i coded up quicksort in C++ using the same
pivot picking strategy as the FISh code.  I then modified my C++ code,
and the C benchmark code and C translated FISh code (CTFC) from the
FISh website (by CTFC i mean the contents of test01.c), by altering
the random number generator to allow specification of two command line
arguments giving the multiplier and step for the seeding algorithm.
i.e rather than
seed = seed * 25173 + 17431
i used
seed = seed * mult + 17431
for varying mult.

This allowed me to test the extent to which the algorithm was sensitive
to the data being sorted.  What follows are timing values on a DGUX
AlphaStation 255 (233 MHz) with mult = 1,2,3, ... ,10 (on an array of
10000 values).  For each program, i give the total (user + system)
time reported by the builtin time function of bash version
2.02.0(1)-release (alpha-dec-osf4.0) (averaged over 10 trials in
each case). The time columns are libqsort (= the standard library
qsort), cppqsort (= my C++ qsort), fishqsort (= CTFC). They were
compiled with gcc, g++, gcc in each case, and -O optimization.

NOTE: With these mult values, the data supplied to the qsort is
deliberately nonrandom to try and detect the effect proposed in
the second paragraph.

mult         libqsort        cppqsort     fishqsort
1              .0350          3.462          3.410
2              .0348          4.039          4.039
3              .1003          .0334          .0391
4              .0350          4.085          4.052
5              .1130          .0332          .0393
6              .0356          4.042          4.039
7              .1025          .0341          .0382
8              .0357          4.061          4.054
9              .1088          .0336          .0382
10             .0355          4.053          4.041

Observe that the libqsort has much better average performance (and
that its profile is different to the other two - one could
probably determine something about the choice of pivots with enough
tests ;-).  Also, the CTFC at best beats the library by
a factor a bit under 3, whereas the library beats the CTFC
by a factor of over 110.

More importantly, the C++ and fish code run in very similar time,
neither consistently beating the other.  Also, their profiles are
almost identical.

I also ran one bigger test - in the case of a 90000 element array
consisting of 1 to 90,000 in order, the library took around .3
seconds, whereas the CTFC overflowed the stack and crashed
just under 200 seconds into the test (the C++ code took
315 seconds to overflow the stack and crash - i'm not sure what's
causing the difference here, but i suspect it has to do with
the fact my C++ code used paramaters rather than a static struct).

Based on this, I'm proposing that the standard library quicksort is
trading off speed for the average cases to bring the worst cases down
to something acceptable. This is presumably a serious issue for a
library quicksort - its better to run on average somewhat slower in
order to get consistency, as this makes applications easier to test
for market acceptance of speed, rather than the application apparently
hanging when the user manages to sort the worst case database with about
1 million entries in it (when your testers happily sorted their million
entry db's with no trouble).

one other point - the compile time polymorphism is not specific
to FISh (as Ralph Loader mentioned). You write:
> The FISh program avoids making a function call at all.  That is,
> instead of passing the addresses to a function, a primitive comparison

C++ templates also give the ability to supply a compile time comparision
function to sort routines, the code will likewise be specialised on
the given comparison and on the size of the entries.  One could write
sort templates that take the length as well, however since the size
of stuff to be sorted typically varies depending on the current
application state (i.e. in a manner unknown at compile time) this tends
not to be enough of a win to be worth doing.

Bonjour, 

Here is a question about composable pasting schemes (CPS).

In the omega-category In generated by the n-cube, is it possible to
find a kind of "general" formula for the (n-1)-source (target) of 
the n-morphism corresponding to the interior of In ? I can do 
mechanical computation in low dimension but I am not able for the
moment to imagine a formula for any dimension. In high dimension ,
computations become very long.

For example, using notations of Crans/Johnson/Street etc..., in I2, we
have (R(x) means the CPS generated by x, sometimes also denoted by (x)) : 

s_1(00)=R(-0,0+) (almost the definition in a CPS)
and t_0(-0)=s_0(0+)=-+ => s_1(00)=R(-0) o_0 R(0+) (1) because the
union is the composition in the framework of CPS. And 
t_1(00)=R(+0,0-)=R(0-) o_o R(+0) (2). Obvious with a picture.

In I3, we have : 

s_2(000)=R(-00,0+0,00-)=R(-00,0++,-0-,0+0,00-,++0)
t_0(-00)=s_0(0++) => R(-00,0++) = R(-00) o_0 R(0++)
t_0(-0-)=s_0(0+0) => R(-0-,0+0) = R(-0-) o_0 R(0+0)
t_0(00-)=s_0(++0) => R(00-,++0) = R(00-) o_0 R(++0)

and 

t_1(R(-00) o_0 R(0++)) = t_1(-00) o_0 R(0++) (axiom of omegaCat)
                       = (-0-) o_0 (-+0) o_0 (0++) with (2)
                       
s_1(R(-0-) o_0 R(0+0)) = R(-0-) o_0 s_1(0+0) (axiom of omegaCat)
                       = (-0-) o_0 (-+0) o_0 (0++) with (1)
                       
=> R(-00,0++,-0-,0+0) = R(-00,0++) o_1 R(-0-,0+0)

and in the same way, we preove that 
t_1(R(-0-,0+0))=s_1(R(00-,++0))  

=> s_2(000) =((-00) o_0 (0++)) o_1 ((-0-) o_0 (0+0)) o_1 ((00-) o_0 (++0))

For t_2(000), read the above formula from the right to the left and 
replace - by +. Almost obvious with a picture.

For I4 now : 

I have found a formula for s_3(0000)... A little bit long and not
interesting. 

For I5 : Too long. 


More generally, the question is : for a CPS, is there a way to compute 
the source and target of a R({x}) using only compositions of elements 
like R({y}) ?


Thanks in advance for your help.

Yes and no.

Yes in the sense that because the source and the target are pasting
schemes themselves, Johnson's pasting theorem gives that 1. they
are compositions of R({y})'s and 2. *any* way you do this gives the
same result.
No in two senses: although Johnson's proof actually gives an algorithm,
I don't think this algorithm has ever been implemented (in AXIOM for
example); and secondly, there is (as far as I know) no *general*
expression which works for cubes of all dimensions.

I am interested in the foundations of mathematics -more concretely,
in the claim that category theory can serve as a superior substitute
for set theory in the foundational landscape. In this context, I would
like to point out a footnote which appears in 'What is Cantor's
Continuum Problem?', written by Kurt G?del in 1947, revised and expanded
in 1964, and finally published in Benacerraf P. and Putnam H. (eds.) 1983:
Philosophy of Mathematics. Selected Readings, Cambridge University Press,
pp. 470-485. It reads as follows:

   It must be admitted that the spirit of the modern abstract disciplines
   of mathematics, in particular of the theory of categories, transcends
   this concept of set*, as becomes apparent, e.g., by the self-applicability
   of categories (see MacLane, 1961**). It does not seem however, that
   anything is lost from the mathematical content of the theory if categories
   of different levels are distinguished. If there exist mathematically
   interesting proofs that would not go through under this interpretation,
   then the paradoxes of set theory would become a serious problem for
   mathematics. 
                *(the concept of set G?del was referring to is the iterative
                  one).
               **(MacLane, S. 1961. "Locally Small Categories and the
                  Foundations of Set Theory". In Infinitistic Methods,
                  Proceedings of the Symposium on Foundations of Mathematics
                  (Warsaw, 1959). London and N.Y., Pergamon Press).

I need some help to grasp the following questions:

- In what sense the self-applicability of categories transcends the concept
  of set?. (It is obvious that categories transcend the concept of well-
  founded set but, what's the matter with non-well-founded sets?.

- In what sense do you think G?del proposed distinguishing different levels
  of categories?. Would it be possible that G?del was thinking of something
  like type theory?.

- Do you agree with G?del's intuition that nothing would be lost with such
  a distinction?.

- Finally, in the last lines of the note G?del seems to suggest a research
  programme for category theory as an alternative foundation of mathematics.
  To what extent has it been carried out?.


  Thanks for your help.

                     Axioms of Algebraic Geometry I

                               (11/7/98)

                                (a draft)

The axioms of algebraic geometry given below consist of three (well
known) algebraic axioms (A1) - (A3) and three geometric axioms (G1) -
(G3), based on Diers's axioms of Zariski categories. The complete html
version of this note (with links) is available at
http://www.azd.com/axioms.html. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Consider a functor U: A --> Set from a category A to the category Set of
sets.

Algebraic Axioms:
(Axiom A1) U has a left adjoint.
(Axiom A2) Any bijective morphism in A is an isomorphism.
(Axiom A3) Any pair of parallel morphisms in A has a surjective
coequalizer.

Recall that a functor satisfying the axioms (A1) - (A3) is an algebraic
functor, and the pair (A, U) is an algebraic category (or algebraic
construct, or quasivariety). An algebraic functor U is finitary if it
preserves direct colimits. Any algebraic functor is faithful. In the
following we shall regard A as a concrete category over Set via an
algebraic functor U, and identify an object X with its underlying set
U(X).

A difference of an object is an ordered pair (a, b) of elements of A,
denoted formally by a - b.
(a) A difference a - b is a zero if a = b.
(b) A difference a - b is a unit if for any morphism f: A --> B, f(a) =
f(b) implies that B is terminal.
(c) A difference a - b is nilpotent if for any morphism f: A --> B, f(a)
- f(b) is a unit implies that B is terminal.
(d) An object is reduced if it has no non-zero nilpotent difference; (A,
U) is reduced if any object is reduced.
(e) A morphism f: A --> B is flat if the pushout functor C/A --> C/B
along it preserves monomorphisms.
(f) A difference a - b is invertible (or disjunctable) if there is a
flat epimorphism  i: A --> A(a, b) such that i(a) - i(b) is a unit, and
any morphism j: A --> B factors through i if j(a) - j(b) is a unit.

Suppose U x V is the product of two objects U and V with the projections
u: U x V --> U and v: U x V --> V. The product U x V is co-universal if
for any morphism f: U x V --> Z, let Z --> ZU and Z --> ZV  be the
pushouts of u and v along f, then the induced morphism Z --> ZU  x ZV
is an isomorphism.

Geometric Axioms:
(Axiom G1) Any object has a unit difference.
(Axiom G2) The product of any two objects isco-universal.
(Axiom G3) Any difference of an object is invertible.

We call any functor U: A --> Set satisfying the above six axioms an
algebraic-geometric functor. An algebraic-geometric category is a pair
(A, U) consisting of a category A and an algebraic-geometric functor U
on A.

Remark. (cf. [Luo, Categorical Geometry]) (a) An algebraic-geometric
category is the opposite of an analytic geometry.
(b) A finitary algebraic-geometric category is the opposite of a
coherent analytic geometry.
(c) Any finitary algebraic-geometric category satisfies the first five
of the six axioms of Zariski categories defined in Diers's book
Categories of Commutative Algebras, Oxford University Press, 1992. The
sixth axiom simply means that the category is strict, i.e. the
Grothendieck topology defined by open subsets is subcanonical.

Example. The following categories are algebraic-geometric categories:
(a) The category of frames (non-finitary, reduced, non-strict).
(b) The category of distributive lattices (finitary, reduced,
non-strict).
(c) The category of Boolean algebras (finitary, reduced, strict).
(d) The category of commutative rings with identity (finitary,
non-reduced, strict).
(e) The category of reduced commutative rings (finitary, reduced,
strict).
(f) The category of commutative regular rings (finitary, reduced,
strict).

I will pass on this one.  As far as I know, using category theory as
foundations gives an equally powerful, but not more powerful, foundation.
But I would say the same about non-well-founded set theory.  Basically, it
is a matter of convenience and, perhaps, coherence.

In a word: no.

Quite a bit; it is called elementary topos theory.  I want to add
something here.  I have taught a course in set theory (twice, actually). 
I didn't much enjoy it, so perhaps I am prejudiced.  But I have a specific
complaint.  In all the fields of mathematics that I have worked with (all
the axiomatic fields, I should say), structures are defined and then
functions that preserve those structures.  The structure of a set is that
of an epsilon tree, but this structure is ignored when it comes to
defining functions.  A good thing too, since the only functions that
preserve that structure are inclusions of subsets.  And the only
endomorphism of a set is the identity.  Believing that theory should
follow practice, I am unhappy with the standard foundations that build
this elaborate structure only to ignore it.  When categories are used as
foundations, then the undefined terms are object, arrow, domain, codomain,
identity, and the relation (partial function) of composition.  They are
all used regularly in category theory; they are not just there to give a
formal foundation.  And functors are exactly what preserve these things.

NORDDEUTSCHES KATEGORIENSEMINAR (NDKS)

        am 20./21.\ Februar 1999 in Braunschweig


Vor der Jahrtausendwende und in Anlehnung an das wohlbekannte
"Nordwestdeutsche Kategorienseminar" der 70'er Jahre m\"ochten wir an
Kategorien interessierten Mathematikern und Informatikern im
norddeutschen Raum (und dar"uber hinaus) ein Forum bieten, ihre
Ergebnisse zu pr\"asentieren und sich mit anderen auszutauschen.

Insbesondere soll dem kategoriellen Nachwuchs die M\"oglichkeit
geboten werden, im informellen Rahmen Gleichgesinnte kennenzulernen
und evtl.\ erste Tagungserfahrungen zu sammeln.  Insofern wird die
Tagungssprache \"uberwiegend Deutsch sein.  Aber nat\"urlich sind auch
ausl\"andische KollegInnen herzlich eingeladen, falls sie sich gerade
im norddeutschen Raum aufhalten.

Wir verstehen diese Veranstaltung nicht als Konkurrenz zur
erfolgreichen europ"aischen PSSL-Reihe, sondern eher als regionale
Vorbereitung.  

Beim Zeitplan wollen wir uns an das bew\"ahrte Schema halten mit
Vortr\"agen am Samstag und am Sonntag Vormittag, sowie An- und Abreise
am Freitag bzw.\ Sonntag.  Sie k\"onnen nat\"urlich auch l\"anger
bleiben!  Um die Unterbringung der Teilnehmer in Braunschweig k"ummern
wir uns.

Bitte bringen Sie diese Ank\"undigung auch eventuell interessierten
KollegInnen zur Kenntnis.  Wir freuen uns schon auf Ihren Besuch in
Braunschweig!

NORDDEUTSCHES KATEGORIENSEMINAR (NDKS)

        February 20/21, 1999, in Braunschweig


Before the third millennium and in the tradition of the well-known
"Nordwestdeutsches Kategorienseminar" of the 1970's we would like
invite categorically interested mathematicians and computer scientists
from Northern Germany (and beyond) to present their results and to
exchange ideas.

In particular, we hope that students interested in category theory
will have a chance to meet like-minded people in an informal
atmosphere and gain experience at meetings.  Hence we expect most
talks to be in German.  But, of course, foreign colleagues who happen
to be in the area are cordially invited to attend as well.

This meeting is not intended as competition for the highly successful
European PSSL series.  We would like it to serve as regional
preparation instead.

We want to keep the familiar timetable of talks on Saturday and Sunday
morning, which leaves Friday and Saturday for arrival and departure,
respectively.  Of course, you can stay longer, if you wish!  We will
try to find accommodations for the participants.

Please notify your colleagues who might be interested.  We are looking
forward to your visit in Braunschweig!

Dear Categories:

I sent this yesterday but I notice I had mixed up the address. I'll try again.

There are two algorithms: my excision of extremals and the Aitchison-Pascal
triangle.  The former starts with the top dimension cell and works down
while the former builds up the cocycle identities recursively from
dimension 0.

Excision of extremals was done for simplexes on page 325 of [1] resulting
in the formulas on page 330 and 331. The cubes case was done around the
same time but not published. At the end of the 1980s, Ross Moore
implemented this algorithm on a Mac; but things do get big quickly after
the cases given in [1]. For general parity complexes, see page 330 of [2]
where, even after [3], two expository mistakes remain: in the first line of
the Algorithm, "largest" should be "smallest"; on the fourth line the plus
signs should be unions; and on the fifth line the element  w  should be
chosen to be not in  "mu"(u)_(n+1).

Aitchison presented his algorithm for simplexes and cubes at the 1987
category conference in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.  I explain it somewhat on
page 68 of [5]; also see page 559 of [4].  The simplex case can be obtained
from the cube case which has more symmetry.

2. Parity complexes, Cahiers topologie et géométrie différentielle

5. Higher categories, strings, cubes and  simplex equations, Applied
Categorical Structures  3 (1995) 29-77 & 303

Don't be surprised that the formula was hard to imagine. John Roberts said
that no amount of staring revealed the pattern. Yet, the Aitchison-Pascal
triangle is the solution! I seem to remember Iain Aitchison got it first
for the cubes and then, by geometry, transferred to simplexes (which is
where Roberts was looking).

        Well-founding is an irrelevant detail. Take any non-wellfounded set
theory which includes the axiom of choice, such as Aczel's AFA. Then every
set is isomorphic to an ordinal, that is to a well-founded set. Since
categorical methods are all isomorphism invariant, any categorical structure
available in this set theory is also available in well-founded sets. I have
discussed this in an article "Anti-foundation and self-reference" Journal of
Philosophical Logic 22 (1993) 19-28. There is no real chance that abandoning
the axiom of choice will help either--say by adopting AFA without Axiom of
Choice. 

        Rather, the apparent issue is existence of a universal set--a set of
all sets, so that you make a category of all categories. If you want to use
membership based set theory this will require non-wellfounding, but again
the details of membership and wellfounding are irrelevant. 

        Anyway, the problem here is that functions are hard to work with in
set theory with a universal set. I have shown that in any such set theory
meeting a few weak conditions there is a category of all categories, and it
is not cartesian closed. The result is clear from the more particular case
"Failure of cartesian closedness in NF" Journal of Symbolic Logic57 (1992)
555-56. Working with such a poor 'category of all categories' is much more
difficult than just doing without. 

        I think a more promising approach is to use Benabou's theory of
fibrations and definability as in Benabou J. (1985). "Fibered categories and
the foundations of naive category theory". Journal of Symbolic Logic 50,
10-37. I have discussed this briefly in "Category theory: Applications to
the foundations of mathematics" Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998);
and in "Axiomatizing a category of categories" Journal of Symbolic Logic56
(1991) 1243-60. 

        I see no good arguments that there SHOULD be a genuine "category of
all categories" in any strong sense. But it seems an interesting question.

        More likely he was thinking of Eilenberg and Mac Lane's use of
Goedel-Bernay's set theory as a foundation in "The general theory of natural
equivalences", so there are set categories and class categories.

        To study Goedel's claim here, you should look at any of Mac Lane's
papers on foundations that Goedel might have seen by this time. Maybe the
foundational parts of "The general theory of natural equivalences" are all
he could have seen, I don't know. Then it would be good to know what people
around Princeton were saying about category theory at this time--and that
might be very hard to find out.

The following preprint:

M. Grandis,
"An intrinsic homotopy theory for simplicial complexes
with applications to image processing"

is available at:

ftp://pitagora.dima.unige.it/WWW/FTP/GRANDIS/

as:   Lnk.Nov98.ps

***

Abstract. A simplicial complex is a set equipped with a down-closed family
of distinguished finite subsets; this structure is mostly viewed as
codifying a triangulated space. Here, this structure is used directly to
describe "spaces" of interest in various applications, where the associated
triangulated space would be misleading. An intrinsic homotopy theory, not
based on topological realisation, is introduced.
        The applications considered here are aimed at metric spaces and
digital topology; concretely, at image processing and computer graphics. A
metric space  X  has a structure  t_e(X)  of simplicial complex at each
"resolution"  e > 0;  the resulting n-homotopy group  \pi_n(t_e(X))  detects
those singularities which can be captured by an n-dimensional grid, with
edges bound by  e;  this works equally well for continuous or discrete
regions of euclidean spaces.

***

Comments would be appreciated.

In particular, I am uneasy about a question of terminology.

In my opinion, the term "simplicial complex", quite appropriate when the
structure is viewed as codifying a triangulated space, is unfit when such
objects are treated as "spaces" in themselves (somewhat close to
bornological spaces, which have similar axioms on objects and maps).

In other words, "simplicial complex" should not refer to the category
itself, say  C,  but to its usual embedding in  Top,  the simplicial
realisation. The two aspects may clash, e.g. with respect to initial or
final structures: the coarse C-object on three points (final structure, all
parts are distinguished) is realised as a euclidean triangle; a C-subobject
is sufficient to produce a topological subspace (a regular subobject in
Top), but a C-subspace (a regular subobject in  C)  is a stronger notion.
Moreover, from a more concrete point of view, the simplicial realisation is
quite inappropriate in most of the applications considered in this work.

The opposition  "C-object / simplicial complex" is in part similar to
"sequence / series": the second term refers to a more specific view & use
of the same data; the clashing of the opposition is particularly evident in
the notions of convergence, for a sequence or a series.

That's why I am calling a C-object a "combinatorial space". (The term
"combinatorial complex" has also been used for simplicial complex; and I
wanted a term of the form "attribute + space", to use freely of topological
terms like discrete, coarse, subspace...)
But of course it is embarassing to propose a new term for a classical notion.

Hello all,

I got a proof that if Hom-functor h of category C factors through
complete category M up to natural isomorphism (that is $h \cong RP : C*
\times C --> Set$, where P is faithful forgetful functor P : M --> Set
and R : C* \times C --> M) and P preserves limits, then
1. for every category C' Hom-functor Nat of Funct(C',C) factors through
M up to isomorphism: Nat = Nat' P, and
2. if Hom-functor of M itself factors through M and is right adjointed
to multiplication functor (i.e., M is cartesian closed), P preserves
exponential adjoints and for every object x in C there is 
e_x : 1 --> R(x,x), such that e_xP selects 1_x in Hom(x,x), then for
every functor F : C --> M, compatible with R in obvious sense, these
exists natural (on x) isomorphism Nat'(R^x,F) \cong xF as objects in M,
that is Yoneda lemma holds.

Is this known/trivial/known-to-be-false?

Nikita.

 Conceptualizing and axiomatizing
     Mike Barr's experience with teaching membership-based set theory is
shared by many mathematicians, and quite a few share his conclusions.  One
conclusion is that clarification is needed on even more basic questions
than just the large/small issue (which concerned Goedel, Mac Lane, and
Perez), in order to arrive at conceptions and axiomatizations compatible
with the practice of mathematics.  For example, I was aiming at such a
clarification in pp. 118-128 of my 1976 paper in honor of Professor
Eilenberg's 60th birthday, where I advocated some rational connection
between conceptualizing and axiomatizing.
	The complete lack of such a connection in a recent article in the
journal "Mathematical Structures in Computer Science" could have been
avoided by the editors, if not by the authors.  In a section labeled 
"Basic Set Theory" (p.510) they quote from my above paper a description of
the notion of abstract set:
	1. ...each element of X has no structure whatsoever.
	2.  X itself has no internal structure except for equality
	    and inequality of pairs of elements....
immediately followed by their absurd conclusion:
"axiomatically this corresponds to taking the membership relation epsilon
as the only primitive notion of set theory and to postulating  .." some
axioms typical to Zermelo-style membership-based theory!  
	Of course those axioms are NOT compatible with the conception
quoted:  they violate (1) because according to the Zermelo primitives and
axioms, an element usually has elements, which would be structure;  and
they violate (2) since according to those primitives and axioms, a pair of
elements of X may stand itself in the membership relation, which would be
an internal structure other than equality.  The authors neglected to quote
the third clause which (as in the example that Mike mentions) their axioms
also violate.
	The notion of abstract set (Kardinalen in Cantor's sense) is basic
among the many other notions of cohesive and/or variable sets (Mengen) to
the extent that we can model the Mengen via diagrams of maps between
abstract sets.  Abstract sets may be "abstracted from" less abstract sets,
as Cantor did, or used, as most modern mathematics in practice does, as
all-purpose memory cells or parameterizers or nodes in such diagrams.  In
addition to the papers by Colin McLarty mentioned in his message of
November 11, 1998, the following papers should help to clarify this notion
and its role in mathematics.

Unfortunately the truly appropriate reference has not yet been
written, because the equivalence between weak infinity-groupoids
and homotopy types has not yet worked out in full detail, at least
not in the cellular version.   The *dream* of translating all of 
homotopy theory into higher category theory is outlined in:

John Baez and James Dolan, Categorification, to appear in Proceedings
Workshop on Higher Category Theory and Mathematical Physics at 
Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, March 1997, eds. Ezra
Getzler and Mikhail Kapranov, preprint available as math.QA/9802029.

This also has lots of references to different places where various
bits of the dream have been realized.  

Basically the dream consists of working out the following correspondence:

HIGHER CATEGORY THEORY             HOMOTOPY THEORY

omega-groupoids                    homotopy types
n-groupoids                        homotopy n-types
k-tuply groupal omega-groupoids    homotopy types of k-fold loop spaces
k-tuply groupal n-groupoids        homotopy n-types of k-fold loop spaces
k-tuply monoidal omega-groupoids   homotopy types of E_k spaces
k-tuply monoidal n-groupoids       homotopy n-types of E_k spaces
stable omega-groupoids             homotopy types of infinite loop spaces
stable n-groupoids                 homotopy n-types of infinite loop spaces
Z-groupoids                        homotopy types of spectra
 
How do A_infinity categories fit in?  As far as I can tell they should
correspond to omega-categories where all j-morphisms are invertible for
j > 1.

Abstract: This paper grew out of a question/suggestion of Lawvere: to use
the "amazing right adjoints" (= fractional exponents) of Synthetic
Differential Geometry, to get information on the category of second order
differential equations. As a byproduct of our investigations, we derive
some information about the strength (enrichment) of fractional exponent
functors in general.

             On the compact-regular coreflection 
         of a compact stably locally compact locale.

ABSTRACT: The Scott continuous nuclei form a subframe of the frame of
all nuclei. We refer to this subframe as the patch frame. We show that
the patch construction exhibits (i) the category of Stone locales and
continuous maps as a coreflective subcategory of the category of
coherent locales and coherent maps, (ii) the category of compact
regular locales and continuous maps as a coreflective subcategory of
the category of compact stably locally compact locales and perfect
maps, and (iii) the category of regular locally compact locales and
continuous maps as a coreflective subcategory of the category of
stably locally compact locales. We relate our patch construction to
Banaschewski and Brümmer's construction of the dual equivalence of the
category of compact stably locally compact locales and perfect maps
with the category of compact regular biframes and biframe
homomorphisms.

Fortunately, since the A_\infty categories (described sketchily in the
preprint I have of Fukaya) use chain complexes rather than topological
spaces (so that I believe a 1-object A_\infty category is an algebra for
the A_\infty non-permutative operad on chain complexes - an A_\infty
DG-algebra), we do not need to realise the whole homotopy types dream (as
described by John Baez) to give a categorical description of A_\infty
categories. Several years ago I remember discussing this by email with Jim
Stasheff.  Dominic Verity was here at the time.  I cannot remember all the
details but the two basic ingredients were some free strict n-categories
made from the set (whose elements are to be the objects of the A_\infty
category) in much the way the orientals are constructed, and the
construction (below) mentioned in my Oberwolfach Descent Theory notes of
September 1995.

        There is a connection between the Gray tensor product and ordinary
chain complexes.  Each chain complex R gives rise to a (strict)
omega-category J(R) whose 0-cells are 0-cycles  a  in  R, whose 1-cells  b
: a --> a'  are elements  b  in  R_1  with  d(b) = a'- a,  whose 2-cells  c
: b --> b'  are elements  c  in  R_2  with  d(c) = b'- b,  and so on.  All
compositions are addition.  This gives a functor  J :  DG --> omega-Cat
from the category  DG  of chain complexes and chain maps.  In fact,  J :
DG --> omega-Cat  is a monoidal functor where  DG  has the usual tensor
product of chain complexes and  omega-Cat  has the Gray tensor product.  By
applying  J  on homs, we obtain a (2-) functor  J_* :  DG-Cat --> V_2-Cat,
where  V_2  is  omega-Cat  with the Gray-like tensor product (extending the
natural tensor product of oriented cubes as described in Sjoerd Crans
thesis).  In particular, since  DG  is closed, it is a DG-category and we
can apply  J_*  to it.  The V_2-category  J*(DG)  has chain complexes as
0-cells and chain maps as 1-cells; the 2-cells are chain homotopies and the
higher cells are higher analogues of chain homotopies.

Ross

Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca

X-Status: 

After seeing Eric Goubault's work on directed homotopy, where he defines a
notion of "locally partially ordered space", I found myself considering the
following topos. Does anyone know if it has been used, for instance in
algebraic geometry or algebraic topology?

What I am trying to capture by the definition is the process of taking the
lower semicontinuous reals in [0,1] (classically, [0,1] with its Scott
topology, so that the numerical order becomes the specification order) and
identifying 0 and 1. Then the specialization from 0 to 1 becomes a
non-trivial endomorphism e of 0, so we are forced to consider the modified
space as a topos, not a locale. In addition, an extra point will spring
into existence, namely the (filtered) colimit of

  0 --> 0 --> 0 --> ...
     e     e     e

The topos is given by a site as follows. Let Q+ be the additive monoid of
non-negative rationals and Q/Z the rationals modulo the integers. Q+ acts
on Q/Z by addition. Let C be the corresponding category of elements (object
= element [q] of Q/Z, morphisms ([q],f): [q] -> [q+f] for f in Q+) and
generate a Grothendieck topology on C^op by letting any object [q] of C be
cocovered by all the morphisms ([q],f) for f > 0.

Let E be the topos corresponding to this site on C^op. Its points are flat
presheaves F on C with the condition that if x is in F([q]) then x =
([q],f)y for some f > 0, y in [q+f]. The points arising from the
wrapped-round [0,1] are like half-infinite helices (F([q]) = N for all q),
and the new point is like an infinite helix (F([q]) = Z for all q).

I have not seen Fukaya's paper.

If the problem is to formalise higher homotopies for, say, topological
spaces or chain complexes,  together with their operations, there is a
simple solution based on the path endofunctor (or, dually, the cylinder
endofunctor; or their adjunction) and its powers.

The path endofunctor  P  is constructed so that a homotopy  a: f -> g: X ->
Y  amounts to a map  a: X -> PY;  the maps  f, g  are recovered by means of
the two faces  d-, d+: PY -> Y.
(For  Top,  PY  is obviously the space  Y^[0, 1]  of paths in  Y,  with the
compact-open topology; for chain complexes  (PY)_n  =  Y_n + Y_(n+1) + Y_n,
with suitable differential.)

P  comes equipped with various natural transformations (faces, degeneracy,
connections, symmetries, concatenation...), satisfying "algebraic"
coherence axioms (a sort of "cubical comonad" with additional structure).
These transformations represent the basic structure of lower order
homotopies.

But now you have, practically for free:

- n-tuple homotopies, represented by the power endofunctor  P^n,
- n-homotopies, represented by a subfunctor  P_n  of  P^n,
- their operations, via the usual algebra of natural transformations,
- the deduced coherence relations of the latter.

Eg, a double homotopy, represented by a map  X -> P^2(Y),  has four faces
given by the four natural transformations  d-P, d+P, Pd-, Pd+: P^2 -> P;
if  k  is the concatenation of homotopies,  kP  and  Pk  are the vertical
and horizontal concatenation of double homotopies, and so on; if  k  is
associative, as is the case for chain complexes but not for spaces, so are
all higher concatenations. A double homotopy is said to be a 2-homotopy
when its "vertical" faces (say) are trivial, i.e. factor through the
degeneracy  1 -> P.
(For  Top,  P^2(Y)  is the space of maps from the standard square  [0, 1]^2
to Y;  P_2(Y)  is the subspace of those maps which are constant on the
vertical faces of the square.)

This way of deducing higher homotopies and their operations from the lower
ones can be found in:

M. Grandis, Categorically algebraic foundations for homotopical algebra,
Appl. Categ. Structures 5 (1997), 363-413.

This is in reply to a message of James Stasheff
and of other participants.

I agree that the language of category is more than analogous to
homotopy theory, and think that the connection is deep.
The work on A-infinity spaces is a striking early illustration of the 
connection between homotopy coherence and categorical coherence.
Homotopy theory is the main guideline for the emergence 
of higher category theory.
For example, the first correct concept of 3-category was discovered
as a direct outcome of modelling homotopy 3-types with Gray groupoids.
Before this example, all existing 3-categories were equivalent to strict ones.

In my opinion, after a first stage of developpement, higher category theory
should induce new progress in homotopy theory. This is the real test.  
In particular, the new theory should help understanding
homotopy groups of spheres.

I am including an abstract of my talk on a related subject.

This is not really an adequate reply to Jim's query. The reason is that as
I understand it, he is asking for a source that will explore the homotopy
theory of the `globular' models of weak infty categories. My approach to
the area is in some sense the dual. Starting with the various models for
homotopy types or bits of them, try to see what is mirrored in the weak
infty category theory by the homotopy structure.  This is in some sense the
converse to his query but may none-the-less be relevant.

My intuition was, and still is, that the Kan condition on simplicial sets
gives a composition/pasting up to coherent homotopy. Moreover the `filler'
gives the justification for the composite. (Compare the filler structure of
the nerve of a category with that in an arbitrary Kan complex.) Accepting
that as a starting point, and the idea that the `category' of weak infinity
categories should be a weak infinity category, Jean-Marc Cordier and I
looked at `locally Kan' simplicially enriched categories (e.g. Trans AMS
349(1997)1-54). With that viewpoint, it becomes clear that the structure of
an A_\infty category is needed to make things really `coherent', but that
many of the constructions of `ordinary' category theory have A_\infty or
homotopy coherent analogues in this setting, which thus serves as a
test-bed' for the development of the more general theory.  In part this
relates to Michael Batanin's paper in the Cahiers where explicit
consideration of A_\infty structure is given.

That theory looks at the `global' structure to some extent, but
simplicially enriched groupoids model all homotopy types, so a corollary of
the simplicial to globular type of transition should be that one should be
able to construct weak \infty categroies DIRECTLY from the algebra of a
simplicially enriched groupoid.  The obvious place to look for this is in
the Moore complex which carries a hypercrossed complex structure in the
sense of Pilar Carrasco and Antonio Cegarra.  (This is related to the
n-hypergroupoid structures of Jack Duskin.) Exploring the \infty category
structure, potentially in their definition, is the  aim of another line of
research and in low dimensions, this has been attacked by Ali Mutlu and
myself,  (see very recent articles in TAC or Bangor's preprint list on the
web). 

Getting nearer to Jim's query, any bridge between homotopy theory and
higher dimensional category theory should I feel aim to be approachable by
algebraic topologists and therefore should start with a recognisable model
for homotopy types.

Another approach that must be mentioned is that of Tamsamani and Simpson
using multisimplicial objects. Presumably this also links in with the
cat^n-groupoid approach pioneered some 14 years ago by Loday.  This only
handles n-types but can be extended to a model that has higher information
but in those dimensions above n, the Whitehead products are trivial. (Has
anyone looked at the Whitehead and Samelson products from a globular or
weak \infty category viewpoint?)

The question of simplicial rather than cubical theory is a difficult one.
Marco Grandis made a good case for the cubical formulation the other day,
and the use of Kan filler conditions in a cubical setting has been for a
long time a speciality of Heiner Kamps (see the recent book by him and
me!). That theory does not directly address the question of A_\infty
category structures, but it does raise a question that deserves some
attention. Suppose you want an analogue of a given theorem from homotopy
theory but in another non-topological context and you can get a weak
composition structure in your setting (typically given by fillers for boxes
in a cubical `enrichment'). What fillers/composites do you need for your
particular theorem (e.g.Dold's theorem on homotopy equivalence between
cofibrations, or long Dold-Puppe type sequences)?  

This last question also raises that of the motivation for the
generalisations.  I am convinced these are useful, even important, but
perhaps some debate on directions to explore and goals to seek out might
help in providing a fuller answer to Jim's question.

     Volterra's functionals and the covariant cohesion of space

Abstract:
	Volterra's principle of passage from finiteness to infinity is far
less limited than a linearized construal of it might suggest;  I outline
in Section III a nonlinear version of the principle with the help of
category theory.  As necessary background I review in Section II some of
the mathematical developments of the period 1887-1913 in order to clarify
some more recent advances and controversies which I discuss in Section I.
Some relevant historical and current literature is discussed in relation
to the categorical analysis:  Volterra and Hadamard on the notion of
element, Fichera's critique of the relation between functional analysis
and continuum physics, and the recent Michor & Kriegl book published by
the AMS.



	Outline of Synthetic Differential Geometry

Abstract:
These rough notes were distributed to the geometry seminar at Buffalo
in February 1998, sketching the background of categorical dynamics in
anticipation of the April 1999 AMS Meeting in which there will be a
special session on related matters.  In particular, some of the results
stated in my September 1997 AMS talk in Montreal "Toposes of laws of
motion" are outlined, especially the relation of second order differential
equations to a.t.o.m's (amazingly tiny object models).  An additional
appendix has been added (November 1998) to these rough notes concerning
recent advances on these questions by Kock and Reyes.

There is a more down to earth and historically rooted approach. 

A concern of the early topologists (Dehn, Hopf, Alexandroff,...) 
was to find a higher dimensional version of the fundamental group, since 
the were irritated by the facts that 
(i) \pi_1 gave good geometric information (e.g. for complex variable 
theory) which often involved the non commutativity, 
(ii) H_1 was \pi_1 made abelian, for connected spaces, 
(iii) H_n existed for all n \ge 0 (and was abelian). 

There was also the intuition of big things made out of composing little 
bits (simplices in the Poincare formulation). The `solution' was to use 
formal sums (homology), and this gave abelian results. 

Cech's 1932 submission on Higher homotopy groups to the Zurich ICM 
was withdrawn at the request of Alexandroff and Hopf once they had proved 
these groups abelian for n \ge 2. 

The whole aim was to get immediate geometric results and computations. 

My suggestion in 1967 was to use `higher homotopy groupoids' since these 
did not have to be abelian. It was only in 1974 that Philip Higgins and I 
found a definition of a homotopy double groupoid of a pair; 
 with this and the work with Chris Spencer we could prove a 2-D Van 
Kampen theorem. This is still giving actual computations of homotopy 
2-types and invariants not previously known. For an exposition see my 
notes
Groupoids and crossed objects in algebraic topology
from the 1997 School in Algebraic Topology at Grenoble 
http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/brownpr.html
which also go on briefly to the higher dimensional case (for strict higher 
groupoids) parts of which were announced in 1977 (with Philip Higgins, 
Compte 
Rendue Acad. Sci. Paris S\'er. A. 285 (1977) 997-999, 286 (1978) 91-93. 

Also, with the use of n-fold groupoids one can recover all n-types 
(Loday) a result Grothendieck described to me in 1986 (in Montpellier) as  
`absolutely 
beautiful'. Again, the intricate structure of these can give new 
computations of homotopy invariants and homotopy types, while studying 
pushouts of these (strict again!) one can find new algebraic 
constructions, such as a non abelian tensor product of groups (which act 
on each other).  

We have to develop new methods to compute even with 
these strict objects, so there is still a lot to be done in getting 
explicit information on specific examples using the non strict ones. 

One overall setting is to have functors

                             \Pi
                          ---------->
       (topological data) <--------- (Algebraic data)
                              IB
               |                       |
             U |                       | B 
               |                       |
               V                       V
               ======== (spaces)======                            

where IB (\mathhbb{B}) and B are classifying data or space functors, U  
is forget, and \Pi is a functor which should satisfy Van Kampen Theorem 
(preserve certain colimits), and also \Pi  IB is equivalent to 1. 

At the level of 3-types we have such a set up with topological data = 
squares of (pointed) spaces, algebraic data = crossed squares (a kind of 
triple groupoid). We do not (so far) have such a setup when (algebraic 
data) is say the candidate proposed by Andre (which are equivalent to 
2-crossed modules). Graham Ellis has shown how to compute 3-types and 
homotopy classes of maps using the above set up (Math. Z., 461 (1993) 
93-110. ). The existence of the functor \Pi (satisfying VKT, so one 
can apply free algebraic objects) helps a lot. 

So I find it interesting that even strict 3-fold groupoids have an 
intricate structure (they model 3-types!). The relations and uses of all 
these models needs lots of work. 

The tensor product of crossed complexes (corresponding to a Gray tensor 
product of strict \infinity groupoids) yields interesting models for 
loop spaces, by considering monoids for this tensor:
(see for example Baues and Tonks
On the twisted cobar construction. Mathematical Proceedings of the 
Cambridge Philosophical Society 121 (1997) pp.229-245 ). 

But the nice thing about crossed complexes is one can write down explicitly 
the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem (Tonks' thesis), which I have not seen for 
infinity groupoids!

I think it is safe to say that the ``n-category crowd'' (myself included)
would love to make some progress on this.
The main thing I am wondering about is: what exactly does one want to know
about the homotopy groups of spheres? for example, is there a concrete
question
which needs answering?

Up until not too long ago, I was under the impression that the question was
how to calculate them; but it turns out that E. Brown in 1956 gave a
perfectly good algorithm for calculating homotopy groups;
another was subsequently given by Kan and refined by Curtis: one just has
to calculate the ``nonabelian  homology groups'' of a simplicial complex of
free groups, and by Curtis one can divide out by a higher commutator
subgroup so this actually only concerns a simplicial complex of  nilpotent
groups.


(I give another algorithm in q-alg/9710011 using n-categorical type ideas,
but this doesn't necessarily seem particularly useful and in any case I
have more recently learned that it is basically the same thing as the
``Milgram model'' see the Handbook, see also an article by Baues for the
double loop space etc.etc....)

One might complain that these are ``algorithms'' rather than ``formulae''
but I have never quite understood the distinction. One generally needs a
computer algorithm to evaluate one of Zagier's formulas! Maybe there is a
subtle type of distinction about the type of machine the algorithm is
supposed to run on?
Or a quantitative question about the asymptotics of the computing time?


Another possible version of the question (related to the computing time
question in the previous sentence) might be: does one know how to bound the
size of the $\pi _i (S^k)$? I can imagine applying n-categorical ideas to
give a bound here, but it seems to be that there must be known bounds using
spectral sequences or other. If there are known bounds, does someone know
what the best one is?

Other than that, does Prof. Joyal or anyone else have an idea of the type
of question about the $\pi _i(S^k)$ which could/should be attacked by
n-categories?

--------------------

On an introduction to $n$-categories: it would be great if J. Baez could
bundle together his ``This week's finds in math. phys.'' which concern
$n$-categories. This would make a really nice introduction specially for
friends and family.

For the more mathematically minded, a recommended ``bapteme de feu'' would
be Grothendieck's ``Pursuing stacks''.

Another good place to look is Benabou's LNM 47.

----

On A_{\infty}-categories and \infty-categories: the response of R. Street
looks quite adequate to the question (and in fact is a nice illustration of
what the ``Gray tensor product'' really  means, a point I  had never
clearly understood up to now...). Here are a few more remarks, specially
related to J. Baez's comment.

The notion of Segal category
(which, again I recently found out, first appeared in the paper of
Dwyer-Kan-Smith...) corresponds to the notion (that J. Baez mentionned) of
\infty-category in which the $i$-morphisms are invertible for $i>1$ (I call
this condition ``$1$-groupic'').

A first remark is that Segal categories are equivalent to strict
simplicially enriched categories, as was already shown by Dwyer-Kan-Smith.
(in particular, you can read ``simplicially enriched category'' wherever I
write ``1-groupic $\infty$-category'' below...). This suggests that
A_{\infty}-categories are also probably equivalent to strict i.e. DG
categories, but it isn't a proof (see below for why not) and it would be
interesting to know if someone has an answer to that question.

Segal categories or $1$-groupic $\infty$-categories, are not actually
totally equivalent to A_{\infty} categories, because they don't encode the
``spectrum'' structure on Hom sets. In fact the notion of
$A_{\infty}$-category in the DG
world probably has a topological analogue where the Hom's are indeed spectra
(cf Vogt et al on E_{\infty} ring spaces and the like???).

Here is a proposition for an $\infty$-categorical notion which should
correspond to this placing of a spectra structure on the Hom spaces.
Suppose $C$ is a 1-groupic $\infty$-category.  We say that $C$ is {\em
spectric}
if it satisfies the following conditions:
---C has an initial and final  object and these coincide (call them *);
---if $X\in C$ then the fiber product $\Omega X := * \times _{X} *$
exists (as a homotopy-limit) in $C$; (also that $\Omega$ becomes a functor...?)
---the functor  $\Omega$ is an equivalence of categories.

These conditions are inspired by M. Hovey's definition of ``stable model
category''
in ``Model categories''. (In particular, if M is a stable model category then
the simplicial category, Dwyer-Kan localization of M inverting wk equivs
L(M), will be a spectric $\infty$-category.)

It follows from this definition that the $Hom$ spaces in C (i.e. the
$\infty$-groupoids which are the Hom's of the $\infty$-category C) have
structures of spectra:
Hom(x,y)=\Omega Hom(x, \Omega ^{-1}y) = \Omega Hom(\Omega x, y) etc.
Thus, C will correspond to the version of A_{\infty} category mentionned
above where the Homs are spectra.

On the other hand, given an A_{\infty}-category B, formally adjoin the
shifts of objects, by setting for example Hom(X, Y[n]):= \Omega^nHom(X,Y)
(for integers n) etc. It looks likely that this will give a spectric
$\infty$-category C, and that these two constructions will be (as much as
possible) a correspondence between A_{\infty}-categories and spectric
$\infty$-categories.

....

Sorry to clog up the e-waves so...

Michael Batanin:

One can generalize "ordinary" category theory in the different ways. One
can consider internal category theory, enriched category theory. We can
also consider a category as a special sort of simplicial set. All this 
points of view have their own A_{\infty}-analogues.

I realize, that the approach of Smirnov, Fukaya and others is a
generalization of "internal" category theory. In my paper "Monoidal
globular categories as a natural environment ..."(Adv.Math. 136, 39-103
(1998)) I also consider a Cat-internal version of
A_{\infty}-\omega-category (so it involves a weak form of interchange
law)that I call monoidal globular category. A surprising coherence
theorem sais that a general monoidal globular category is equivalent to
a strict one (the internal category structure on objects aloows to
strictify interchange low). 

In another my paper "Homotopy coherent category theory and
A_{\infty}-structures in monoidal categories" (JPAA 123(1998),67-103) I
defined an enriched version of A_{\infty}-category. So 
we have a honnest set of objects but morphisms are objects of a monoidal
simplicial categories with a Quillen model structure. I also can define
what A_{\infty} functor is and prove an appropriate coherence and
homotopy invariance theorems. 
Another nice theorem sais that A_{\infty}-categories and their
A_{-infty}-functors form an A_{infty}-category in a natural way. 
  
The simpliocial point of view on A_{\infty}-categories goes back to 
Boardman and Vogt book. The corresponding notion is a simplicial set
satisfying some weak Kan conditions. This approach was extensively used
by T.Porter and J.-M.Cordier (see T.Porter's answer on Jim's query).

Mivhael Batanin:
 In my work "Globular monoidal
categories ..." I introduced the n-dimensional operads over trees. A
1-dimensional operad in this sense is not exatly the same as usual
non-symmetric operad as every operation may have source and target and
we can multiply just composable chains of operations. A one object
version of this may be identify with a usual nonsymmetric operad. (In my
paper I use \omega-operads). I wonder if a partial operad is the same as
my 1-operad?

Call for Admission and Grant Applications

This is a call for admission and  grant applications from students to BRICS
International PhD   School in Computer  Science   at University  of Aarhus,
Denmark.  The  call  is  aimed   at students  starting  August  1999,  with
application deadline January 15th, 1999.

BRICS  International PhD School is an  integrated part  of the BRICS (Basic
Research in Computer Science) Research  Centre, and both  are funded by the
Danish National Research  Foundation. The   school admits 10-15    students
(Danish and   foreign) annually, and  it provides   a substantial number of
student grants.

The core areas of  the PhD School  are: Semantics of Computation; Logic  in
Computer   Science;  Computational   Complexity;  Design  and  Analysis  of
Algorithms; Programming Languages; Distributed Computing; Verification; and
Data Security and Cryptology.

The PhD school will  provide its students with  a  solid background in  the
theoretical  foundation  of  computer science,  and  centred  around  BRICS
activities. From  this foundation, the  students may either continue in one
of  the core areas or venture into  areas of a more applied or experimental
nature as possible areas of thesis specialisation.

The PhD School wishes to recruit PhD students  of the highest international
standards.  It provides an   excellent research environment  and scientific
training facilities, and aims at making its  PhD graduates attractive for a
wide spectrum of employers - in private and public research and development
institutions, both in Denmark and abroad.

So, if you are a student with at least four years of full-time study by the
summer of 1999,   highly motivated and well   prepared for a   PhD study in
computer  science within a  truly international environment, please send us
an application  following the instructions below.  For more details, please
visit
                           http://www.brics.dk,

or contact us by e-mail at phdschool@brics.dk.

students and colleagues at your university or research institute.


BRICS

The Research Centre BRICS (Basic  Research In Computer Science) was founded
in 1994  by the Danish National Research  Foundation at the Universities of
Aarhus and Aalborg.  BRICS is a centre of  basic research  in Algorithmics,
Logic and Semantics, and has a  scientific staff of  30 (permanent and long
term visitors), and around 100 short term visitors annually.


Admission Prerequisites and Study Structure

Admission is based  on knowledge corresponding  to four years of  full-time
studies, including basic courses in  programming and programming languages,
computer   systems, algorithms    and data  structures,  computability  and
mathematics (this list will be interpreted in a flexible way).

The time allocated for the  PhD studies is a  further four years, where the
first  two  years  include some   mandatory course  work   and introductory
research, concluded by a qualifying examination, whereas the last two years
are dedicated to  the writing of the  thesis, finishing with a defence. All
students admitted to the  school will enter  this study structure. We  may,
however, take into account merits from previous study.

Students  are  normally  admitted   for the  semester  start September 1st.
--- but admission may  take place throughout  the year.


PhD Student Grants

The school offers student grants of different types:

1. tuition waiver and full studentship
2. tuition waiver and partial studentship
3. tuition waiver

Only a limited amount of type 1. grants are available.

Bonjour, 

I think that I have found a small pathological behaviour with 
dimension of morphisms in omega-categories. This is the following
one.

Let us first  recall that 
       min{m/s_m(x)=x} = min{n/t_n(x)=x} =: dim(x). 
Because x = s_m(x) = t_m s_m(x) (because m=<m) = t_m(x).

Lemma 1 : Let u and v be two composable morphisms of dimension
1 (i.e. t_0(u)=s_0(v)). Suppose that t_0(v)<>s_0(u) (<> means
different). Then u o_0 v is of dimension 1.

Proof : Suppose that u o_0 v of dimension 0. Then 
s_0(u) = s_0(u o_0 v) = u o_0 v and
t_0(v) = t_0(u o_0 v) = u o_0 v
So s_0(u) = t_0(v) : false.

Here is now the pathological behaviour : 

If s_0(u) = t_0(v), here is an example of category with u and
v of dimension 1 and u o_0 v of dimension 0 : 

We take A={alpha,beta,u,v} (four elements)

-------------------------------------
	alpha	beta	u	v
-------------------------------------
s_0	alpha	beta	alpha	beta
-------------------------------------
t_0	alpha	beta	beta	alpha
-------------------------------------

and for o_0 : 

-------------------------------------
	alpha	beta	u	v
-------------------------------------	
alpha	alpha	xxxx	u	xxxx
-------------------------------------
beta	xxxx	beta	xxxx	v
-------------------------------------
u	xxxx	u	xxxx	alpha
-------------------------------------
v	v	xxxx	beta	xxxx
-------------------------------------

(at the intersection of row x and column y, read x o_0 y)

All axioms of categories seem to be verified (?). The only composition
is a "word" of finite length "... u (beta) v (alpha) u (beta) v..."

In (A,s_0,t_0,o_0), u and v are of dimension 1 and u o_0 v
of dimension 0 because u o_0 v = alpha. 

Where am I wrong ? (observe that this behaviour cannot appear with 
for example a category coming from a composable pasting scheme).

Higher-Dimensional Algebra IV: 2-Tangles
John C. Baez, Laurel Langford

Just as knots and links can be algebraically described as certain
morphisms in the category of tangles in 3 dimensions, compact surfaces
smoothly embedded in R^4 can be described as certain 2-morphisms in
the 2-category of `2-tangles in 4 dimensions'.   Using the work of
Carter, Rieger and Saito, we prove that this 2-category is the `free
semistrict braided monoidal 2-category with duals on one unframed
self-dual object'.  By this universal property, any unframed self-dual
object in a braided monoidal 2-category with duals determines an
invariant of 2-tangles in 4 dimensions.

Dear categoricians,

I'm wondering about the possibility of speaking of trajectories in a
category. That is, given a category C, in what sense - if any - can we
consider a continuous function R->C (where R are the real numbers).
What extra structure is needed on C to consider it as a topological
space? what relation with the category structure?
I guess there's a link with topos theory, but I can't make it really
clear...
Subsidiary question: in what case is there a notion of differentiability
for the function f?
Thank you for direct answers or pointers to (quite easyly
understandable) literature.

The key is indeed via toposes, specifically Grothendieck toposes. As has
always been recognized, these are generalized topological spaces and the
geometric morphisms are generalized continuous maps.

Instead of a category C whose objects are XXX's, you replace it by a topos
whose points are XXX's (i.e. the classifying topos for the theory of
XXX's). For instance, the category of set would be replaced by the
classifying topos for the theory of sets (i.e. what's described in
Johnstone's book and elsewhere as the "object classifier"). I'll write
S[set] for this classifying topos.

This works provided the objects and morphisms of C are the models and
homomorphisms of a geometric theory.

Turning to topological spaces X, if X is sober then its points are also the
models of a geometric theory (to do proper justice to this you need to take
the localic approach to topology) and so there is a corresponding
classifying topos SX which is actually the category of sheaves over X.

The "continuous maps" between toposes are just the geometric morphisms.
They transform points of the source topos to points of the target.

Specific examples:

1. For two toposes SX and SY obtained from topological spaces, the
geometric morphisms from SX to SY really do correspond to the continuous
maps from X to Y.

2. Geometric morphisms from SX to S[set] are the sheaves on X, and these
can indeed be thought of as continuous maps from X to the category of sets
(each sheaf maps points of X to their stalks).

By no means can every category C be considered the category of models of a
geometric theory. One necessary condition (not sufficient) is for C to have
all filtered colimits. For a small category C, one can make a corresponding
topos S^C (the functor category from C to sets) that is an analogue of the
ind completion (which freely adjoins filtered colimits). Its points are the
flat presheaves over C and include (by the Yoneda embedding) a full and
faithful image of C.

A particular link with category structure lies in specialization. Any sober
topological space has the specialization order on its points, and a topos
has analogous specialization morphisms between points - they are just
homomorphisms between models of the geometric theory. For a topos SX
obtained from a space, this "specialization category" structure on the
points is a poset, the original specialization order. Any geometric
morphism is, when considered as a points transformer, functorial with
respect to the specialization morphisms - this generalizes the topological
fact that a continuous map is monotone with respect to the specialization
order.

Though the "generalized space" ideas are not at all new, they are often
hidden expositionally by the idea of topos as generalized universe of sets.
If you look at my paper "Topical Categories of Domains" (to appear in Maths
Structures in Computer Science but at present available through my Web home
page) you will find a careful attempt to discuss toposes directly as
generalized spaces.

The home page is

   http://theory.doc.ic.ac.uk:80/people/Vickers/

There is also a short paper "Strongly Algebraic = SFP (Topically)" that
includes a summary in these purely spatial terms of established results
about points of presheaf toposes.

Regarding differentiability, I too would be interested to hear of answers
or pointers. I guess it would most conveniently be discussed using
Caratheodory's approach. If X is a topological ring, or a ring object in
the category of toposes, then f: X -> X is C^1 iff there is some continuous
phi: XxX -> X such that

   for all x, y. f(y) - f(x) = (y-x).phi(x,y)

(The use of quantified "elements" of X can easily be translated into the
equality of two geometric morphisms from XxX to X.)

The derivative of f is f'(x) = phi(x,x).

Steve Vickers.

There are a lot of complicated and interesting patterns in the stable 
homotopy groups of spheres.   A lot of these patterns are currently 
studied using a generalized cohomology theory called complex cobordism 
theory, together with an intricate mess of spectral sequences:

Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres / Douglas C.
Ravenel.  Orlando: Academic Press, 1986.

Nilpotence and periodicity in stable homotopy theory / by Douglas C.
Ravenel.  Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press, 1992.

It's all far too technical for me to understand, so I don't have much
hope of suddenly answering some question that homotopy theorists are 
stuck on!  However, I think that the n-category crowd can give more
conceptual explanations of some facts that appear as miracles in the 
current approach.  For example, there's an important relation between 
complex cobordism theory and formal group laws: the complex cobordism 
of a point is "the universal formal group law".  There should be an 
elegant conceptual proof of this, but as far as I know, there are just 
elegant *heuristics* for why it should be true, followed by a grungy 
computation.

Especially during the holiday season!  I should try to bundle them together
more nicely at some point, but right now you can start at:

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week73.html ,

skip the bit about left-right asymmetry in amino acids, read the stuff
on n-categories, and then keep clicking on the thing that says:

"To continue reading the `Tale of n-Categories', click here."

It fizzles out around week100, though I plan to resume it with an
issue discussing Carlos Simpson's paper on the stabilization hypothesis 
and Mark Hovey's book on model categories.   

3) Some people have noted that

http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.QA/9811139

doesn't give them the paper "HDA4 - 2-Tangles".  Sorry! - the delay before 
the preprint server makes papers publicly available is longer than it
used to be.  It should be working by tomorrow.   If you still have trouble 
after that (it's a big file and may bust your printer), feel free to 
email me and ask me to send you a copy.

A commutative monoid is a strict monoidal category with one object, so in
this sense one can talk about a category enriched in a commutative
monoid. Has anyone looked very hard at such things?

Thanks,
