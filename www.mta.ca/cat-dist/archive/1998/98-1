From: Uday S Reddy <reddy@cs.uiuc.edu>

Happy New Year, everyone.

I have been wondering about a little question.  Category theory texts
talk about "algebras" for an endofunctor, which are arrows of type FA ->
A, and dually coalgebras A -> GA.  I am interested in the symmetric
case, arrows of type FA -> GA for endofunctors F and G.  
Have such structures been studied?

This is only scratching the surface.  One can ask for a family of such
arrows for an algebra.  One can consider functors F,G: C -> D between
different categories leading to algebras of the form <A, f:FA->GA> where
A is an object of C, and f an arrow in D, and so on.  I am also
interested in the "diagonal" case, arrows of type FAA -> GAA where F and
G are functors C^op x C -> C.  (Note that all these structures have a
"natural" notion of homomorphisms.)

I would appreciate any pointers to the literature.

Uday Reddy

Algebras of form FA -> GA were considered in some detail by the 
Prague school in the 1970s.  Email Jiri Adamek for precise references.

Dear Uday,

There has been an Edinburgh PhD thesis by Tatsuya Hagino on the subject of the
se dialgebras. He defines a strongly normalising lambda calculus based on 
initial terminal dialgebras and also does some general theory. 

Hope this helps, Martin

Aim:
 Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science,
 and the construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated
 in many different frameworks. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum
 for researchers to present their results to those members of the computer
 science community who study or apply the fixed point operation in the
 different fields and formalisms.


Topics:
 Construction and reasoning about properties of fixed points, categorical,
 metric and ordered fixed point models, continuous algebras, relation
 algebras, fixed points in process algebras and process calculi, regular
 algebra of finitary and infinitary languages, formal power series, tree
 automata and tree languages, infinite trees, the mu-calculus and other
 programming logics, fixed points in relation to dataflow and circuits,
 fixed points and the lambda calculus.

MFCS'98 is organised by the Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University in
cooperation with universities in Aachen, Hagen, Linz, Pisa, Szeged, Wien, and
other institutions.

MFCS'98 will be held 25 years after the first MFCS meeting in Czechoslovakia at
Strbske pleso. MFCS'73 is remembered for taking a very broad, advanced, and
stimulating view of the theoretical foundations of computing, and for the high
scientific and organisational standard. MFCS'98 is intended to be another step
along these lines.

Programme Committee: S. Abramsky (Edinburgh), B. Buchberger (Linz), J. Diaz
(Barcelona), V. Diekert (Stuttgart), J. Gruska, co-chair (Brno), I. Guessarian
(Paris), T. Henzinger (Berkeley), R. J. Lipton (Princeton), G. Mirkowska (Pau),
F. Moller (Uppsala), U. Montanari (Pisa), J. Nesetril (Prague), M. Paterson
(Warwick), G. Paun (Bucharest), J. Sgall (Prague), W. Thomas (Kiel), J. Tiuryn
(Warsaw), U. Vaccaro (Salerno), P. Vitanyi (Amsterdam), P. Voda (Bratislava), 
M. Wirsing (Munich), J.  Zlatuska, co-chair (Brno).}

Principal topics of interest include (but are not limited to): design and
analysis of algorithms (sequential, parallel, distributed, approximation,
computational biology, computational geometry, graph, network, number theory,
on-line, optimisation) and data structures, automata, grammars and formal
languages, complexity (communication, computational, descriptional) and
computability, concurrency theory, cryptography and security, databases and
knowledge-based systems, foundations of programming, formal specifications and
program development, models of computation, parallel and distributed computing,
quantum computing, molecular computing, semantics and logics of programs,
theoretical issues in artifical intelligence.

Invited talks of broad and stimulating orientation are offered, consistent with
the more than quarter-century tradition of MFCS.  Speakers: G. Ausiello (Rome),
E. Borger (Pisa), Y. Gurevich (Ann Arbor), D. Harel (Rehovot), R.M. Karp
(Seattle), F.T. Leighton (MIT-Cambridge), W. Maass (Graz), Yu. Matiyasevich
(Petersburg), K. Mehlhorn (Saarbrucken), S. Micali (MIT-Cambridge), M. Nielsen
(Aarhus), A. Pnueli (Rehovot), P. Pudlak (Prague), C. Stirling (Edinburgh), 
J. Wiedermann (Prague), M. Yannakakis (Murray Hill).

MFCS'98 will have several tutorials and workshops.  Proposals can be sent to 
PC co-chairs. The current list of workshops and tutorials is included below.

The CSL'98 conference (Computer Science Logic) will be held in parallel with
MFCS'98 at the same place. The federated CSL/MFCS conference will have common
plenary sessions and social events. Participants registering for one conference
can attend talks of both conferences and parallel workshops.

Costs: The conference fee will be very reasonable as well as daily expenses 
(see the www page for details). The accommodation prices range from 
business-like level to very modest. Students will be able to participate at 
a very low cost. The best student papers will be specially recognised. The 
social programme will include a reception, an excursion to nearby attractions,
a conference dinner, and activities for accompanying persons.

First deadline: The first deadline is the usual one. Accepted papers go to the
hard copy proceedings. Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract not
exceeding 10 LNCS pages. Papers are thoroughly reviewed, double submissions
other than those explicitly mentioned by MFCS/CSL PC are not allowed (see the
www page for details).

       Submission:      March 20, 1998
       Notification:    May 20, 1998

Second deadline: The second deadline is for `wild tiger' session (last minute
hot topics). Accepted papers will appear in electronic proceedings. Authors are
invited to send an abstract not exceeding 5 pages. The emphasis is on
attractiveness of potential talks. There is no restriction on double
submissions.

       Submission:      July 1, 1998
       Notification:    August 1, 1998

All submission should be done electronically using special www forms.

Dear Colleagues:
   Peter asked how things are going, so I thought I would
mention what I know.  As you all know, eastern Ontario and
Quebec were hit by a massive ice storm:  Montreal island was
particularly badly hit. Downtown Montreal is apparently in
very bad shape, with large areas still without power. The
island was cut-off physically (all the bridges were down)
for several days, and many downtown hotels are now without
power. Many streets still have downed power-lines, and it is
unsafe in some cases to walk near trees, buildings, or powerlines because of
falling ice. Triples (and McGill) is down, so there is no 
e-mail contact for now.  In terms of individuals, I have spoken to many
of the categorists and everyone is ok although several people 
(Barr, Prakash,...) are without heat and power
in their homes. They are either staying with friends or rigged-up
some kind of power line from neighbours with electricity at least to run a 
heater. But basically Montreal and nearby communities are a disaster area.
the entire South Shore off Montreal has lost its power grid (i.e. transmission
towers twisted like pretzels because of ice); the same happened in parts of 
Eastern Ontario as far as Kingston, with disastrous effects on dairy farmers, 
etc.
   Here in Ottawa, the situation was bad, although not quite as disastrous
as Montreal.  Forty percent of the trees in Ottawa are damaged, and parts of
Ottawa are still without power (for example, my house since Thursday!). But
downtown is getting back in shape, and Carleton and University of Ottawa
have managed to keep heat. I am still camping-out here in my office for the
near future...    
   
			Keep warm--

			Phil Scott

Probably not... `triples.math.mcgill.ca' has been inoperative since before 
the ice-storm began, which means that many category-theorists in Montreal 
have not been receiving e-mail from this mailing list even before the 

[ note from moderator: actually, the list has been reaching the McGill 
people - until last week of course... ]

blackouts, etc. began.  I think power has been restored to most of the island 
of Montreal (the downtown area lost power at 3pm on Friday, and was still 
without it when I left on Saturday evening), but the electrical infrastructure 
of the South Shore has been destroyed to the point that it must be replaced 
from scratch.  Now that temperatures have dropped to the more usual range for 
this time of year, mass evacuation of the hardest-hit areas by the army is a 
distinct possibility.

The category with objects  <A, f:FA->GA> and evident maps is sometimes 
called an inserter.  It is a weighted limit - a sort of "lax equalizer" 
of the two functors F and G: it may be written as F//G to distinguish 
it from the comma category (which is written F/G).  

It is used in the construction of datatypes (Hagino's thesis - as 
mentioned earlier - see also Dwight Spencer and my paper "Strong 
categorical datatypes II" TCS 139 (1995) 69-113 and its predecessor).
Furthermore, one can express the parametricity properties of combinators 
and modules using these categories (see Peter Vesely's MSc thesis on the 
Charity site (http:/www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/projects/charity/home.html) 
and Maarten Fokkinga's thesis - and paper in a recent MSCS issue - where 
I believe he uses the term "transformer" rather than combinator).

I recently gave a working presentation to IFIP 2.1 entitled a "A reminder 
on inserters" ... this because I felt the connection to datatypes and the 
software structuring and parametricity ramifications of this seemingly 
innocuous limit had still not been sufficiently recognized or exploited.

                       UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX
            
            RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING

One Research Fellow is required  to join the EPSRC funded project
entitled ``Foundations for the Integration of Concurrent Distributed
and Functional Computation'', under the direction of
Matthew Hennessy.

The aim of the project is to 

- provide a uniform coherent semantic foundation for concurrent,
distributed and functional behaviour;

- develop proof methodologies for establishing properties of process
descriptions expressed in specification languages using these
paradigms;

- develop prototypes of supporting verification systems.

The project has already been running for approximately 18 months
and work has concentrated on two streams of research:

     - development of languages, type systems and behavioural 
       theories for mobile computing, where independent processes roam
       widely distributed networks in search of resources and information.
    
     - denotational models for languages combining higher-order
       functional notation with the pi-calculus (examples include
       Cml and core Facile)

The successful candidate will be expected to carry out research 
related to one of these topics. The appointment will be for a period
of two years, starting on 1/04/98,  and salary will be related to the
academic 1A scale. A Ph.D. in Computer Science or Mathematics or
equivalent experience is required. In addition to normal research
duties the successful candidate will be expected to provide some 
assistance to undergraduate teaching.

More details of the project and the conditions of service are available
at ftp://ftp.cogs.sussex.ac.uk/pub/users/matthewh/details.ps.gz

Is the pullback of a monadic functor along a monadic functor
necessarily monadic?
Is the diagonal of the pullback square monadic?
Does this work if your restrict yourself to, say, finitary monadic
functors?

(E.g. it works for finitary monads on Set: the theory of sets with
both ring and lattice structure (not interacting in any particular
way) comes from a monad.)

Thanks,
Tom Leinster

As most of you know, we at McGill are offline since about a week.  McGill's
main computer seems to be online and I was able to telnet to an old account
I had at Penn.  Anyway, I think we are all well.  I was without power for
a week (less 4 four hours).  We spent part of that time in my office
(sleeping bag and couch) and then the power was shut off at McGill (where
it still is) and we went to the Foxes until we got our power back on 
Tuesday morning.  We are now back home and everything is back to normal.
I know there have been some inquiries, whence this note.

No. And I seem to remember this was one of the main points of the thesis
(under Lawvere) of Michel Thie'baud. The thesis title was "Self-dual
structure-semantics & algebraic categories" (Dalhousie University, Halifax,
Nova Scotia, August 1971). Comonads (= cotriples) in Mod (= Bimod = Prof =
Dist) are the subject. Using these to define "algebraic", Michel obtained
stability under pullback.

I just realised my hasty response to Tom Leinster was to the question of
pullback of a monadic alond an *arbitrary* functor; not Tom's question!

Let K be a complete and cocomplete category, and Mnd(K) the category
of monads on K and strict morphisms of monads. If T and S are monads
on K which preserve (alpha-)filtered colimits (for a regular cardinal
alpha), then 
	(i)the coproduct T+S exists in Mnd(K) 
	(ii)this coproduct is ``algebraic'', meaning that the diagonal
	    of the pullback square 
			       K^S
			        |
				|
				v
			  K^T-->K 
	    is the forgetful functor K^(T+S)-->K
	(iii)the projections K^(T+S)-->K^T and K^(T+S)-->K^S are
            monadic.
Much can be done without completeness, but the proofs become a bit harder.

See the paper
	G.M.Kelly, A unified treatment of transfinite constructions for
	free algebras, free monoids, colimits, associated sheaves, and so on,
	Bull. Austral. Math. Soc. 22(1980):1--83
for a survey of many such results.

In fact if K is locally finitely presentable then the category
Mnd_f(K) of finitary monads on K and strict morphisms of monads
is itself locally finitely presentable; for this see my paper
``On the monadicity of finitary monads'', to appear in JPAA, but
in the meantime available at

We are pleased to announce a conference on

		Wholes and their Parts (W/P)

to be held in

		Bolzano, Maretsch Castle, 17-19 June 1998


1. PRESENTATION
Science is connected to the complementarity of analysis and synthesis. It
may be said that classical physics is characterized by an in-built analysis
of the world into constituent parts (such as atoms or elementary particles).
These are then recomposed together to provide, by means of synthesis, any
system; interactions are linearly and locally described; the resulting
hierarchy of structures is grounded on such constituent parts.
In contemporary science, the age of "pure" analysis seems to have ended.
There are deep mathematical reasons for this. Non-linear systems have
properties that, in general, cannot be expressed in terms of decomposition
into ultimate, unstructured, pointlike parts plus a suitable sets of
relations among them. Moreover, the "dialectic" of quantity and quality is
subtler than was previously thought and this dialectic is needed in the
explanation of all sorts of phenomena. It arises not only in physics, but
also in the study of cognitive systems and natural and programming languages.
Within psychology, it is said that "Gestalten" are cohesive wholes and that
"the whole is more than the sum of its parts". But what does this mean
exactly? Similar questions emerge in other contexts as well.
What is relevant for the foundations of science, the need for a clear
understanding of the part/whole relationships, emerges even in logic and
mathematics, since these provide the tools for organizing our rational image
of the world, in its multi-stratified complexity.
Thus, we are faced with the problem of relating in a possibly coherent way
the various forms of part/whole relationships arising in different branches
of science.
We have not only to classify the different kinds of wholes and their
inherent "grammars", but also to take into account the process of formation
for wholes, in order to describe precisely in which sense the whole emerges
out of its parts and is irreducible to an aggregate of autonomous, more or
less pointlike, entities.
What makes (in part, at least) the difference between mere aggregates and
cohesive wholes? The members of the whole do not simply hang together: they
hang together in the whole, and the structure of the whole influences the
description of the parts and their local interactions. In view of the
growing interest in this sort of pattern, of so deep relevance for
theoretical and applied sciences, it is therefore suitable to clarify the
whole/part issues in crucial fields of research, to compare different
approaches and to develop a foundational discussion.

I'd like to announce a technical report relating Power and Robinson's
premonoidal categories to a category of mixed data-flow and
control-flow graphs.

   Premonoidal Categories and a Graphical View of Programs

   Alan Jeffrey
   University of Sussex

The report is available electronically from:

   http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/alanje/premon/

Abstract
--------

This paper describes the relationship between two different
presentations of the semantics of programs:

 * Mixed data and control flow graphs are commonly used
   in software engineering as a semi-formal notation for describing
   and analysing algorithms.

 * Category theory is used as an abstract presentation of
   the mathematical structures used to give a formal semantics to
   programs.

In this paper, we formalize an appropriate notion of flow graph,
and show that acyclic flow graphs form the initial 
symmetric premonoidal category.  Thus, giving a semantics
for a programming language in flow graphs uniquely determines 
a semantics in any symmetric premonoidal category.

For languages with recursive definitions, we show that cyclic flow
graphs form the initial partially traced cartesian category.

Finally, we conclude with some more speculative work, showing how
closed structure (to represent higher-order functions) or
two-categorical structure (to represent operational semantics)
might be included in this graphical framework.

The semantics has been implemented as a Java applet, which takes a
program text and draws the corresponding flow graph (all the diagrams
in this paper are drawn using this applet).

The categorical presentation is based on Power and Robinson's
premonoidal categories and Joyal, Street and Verity's monoidal traced
categories, and uses similar techniques to Hasegawa's semantics for
recursive declarations.  The closed and two-categorical structure is
related to Gardner's name-free presentation of Milner's action
calculi.

Hi Tom,

if I'm not mistaken, this reduces for full isomorphism-closed embeddings to the 
(finite) Intersection Problem (of full iso-closed subcategories) answered 
negatively by Trnkova, Adamek, Rosicky ("Topological reflections revisited", 
ProcAMS 108,3 (1990) p605; see also Tholen "Reflective Subcategories" TopAppl 27 
(1987) p201, Adamek, Rosicky "Intersections of reflective subcategories" ProcAMS 
103 (1988) p710).

Full iso-closed subcategories of locally lambda-presentable categories are 
reflective and closed under lambda-directed colimits iff they are 
lambda-orthogonal, so intersections of such subcategories are reflective 
(Adamek, Rosicky "Locally presentable and Accessible Categories" CUP 94).

Bye, Jan

[ + thanks again for the supervisions ... :-) ]

Title:Algebras and modules in monoidal model categories
Authors: Stefan Schwede, Brooke E. Shipley
Email: schwede@math.mit.edu
Email2: bshipley@math.uchicago.edu

We construct model category structures for monoids and modules in
symmetric monoidal model categories which satisfy an extra axiom, the monoidal
axiom.  This paper was inspired in particular to deal with two of the new
symmetric monoidal categories of spectra, symmetric spectra and $\Gamma$-spaces.

This paper is available at the homotopy theory archive at

        http://hopf.math.purdue.edu

or via anonymous ftp at hopf.math.purdue.edu.   It will also be available 
through math.AT at xxx.lanl.gov.

Dear Colleagues,

Please bring the following to the attention
of possibly interested students:

In the academic year 1998-1999 the Universities
of Utrecht and Nijmegen organize, as part of
the MRI Master Class, a year-long education program
in Mathematical Logic. The program is aimed at 
students who intend to enter a Ph.D.-program in the 
subsequent year.

The courses are in English and foreign students are
specifically invited to apply. A limited number
of stipends are available.

The contents of the program are detailed
in a brochure which exists both as
hard copy and electronically. The text 
can be seen on the homepage of the
Mathematical Research Institute. URL:

http://www.math.ruu.nl/mri

If you're interested in receiving a hard copy 
of the brochure, please send a message to
Marian Brands, at

            THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF MATHEMATICIANS  
 
                     BERLIN, August 18-27, 1998


It can be retrieved from the homepage of the Congress with URL:

    http://elib.zib.de/ICM98
    
ICM'98 is one of the quadrennial congresses held under the auspices of the 
International Mathematical Union (IMU). Mathematicians from all countries 
gather to discuss recent developments in mathematics that are presented by 
leading scientists from all mathematical fields. Responsibility for the 
scientific program lies with the Program Committee appointed by IMU. There 
will be 21 one-hour Plenary Lectures covering the major areas of mathematics 
and about 160 forty-five-minute Invited Lectures in nineteen sections. 

The Fields Medals and the Nevanlinna Prize will be awarded during the Opening 
Ceremony on the first day of the Congress. This will take place in the 
International Congress Center Berlin (ICC). All other scientific events will 
be held at Technische Universitaet Berlin. No scientific activities are 
scheduled for Sunday, August 23.

The Second Announcement of ICM'98 describes the scientific program and the 
social events of the Congress and gives instructions on how to complete the 
registration process and obtain accommodation. It contains a call for 
contributed short presentations, and provides guidelines regarding the 
submission of abstracts. 

The Second Announcement also includes advice on how to proceed upon arrival 
at airports and railway stations, and it will be accompanied by a brochure 
describing the day trips and tours organized by a professional tour and 
congress organizer.

DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS & COMPUTER SCIENCE

3 PH.D. STUDENTSHIPS IN MATHEMATICS OR COMPUTER SCIENCE 

Applications are invited for three fully funded research studentships
leading to the degree of PhD in any aspect of Mathematics or Computer
Science.  The studentships are available for studies beginning in
October 1998.  Applicants should have, or expect to have, a first or
upper second class degree in the relevant subject area.

The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is divided into
three groups: Computer Science, Pure Mathematics and Applicable
Mathematics.  The Pure Mathematics Group carries out research in
several major branches of algebra.  The key areas of expertise are in:
the theory of groups and their representations; algebraic topology and
its applications; the theory of rings and their modules; and the
representation theory and cohomology of finite dimensional algebras.
The Applicable Mathematics Group focuses mainly on numerical analysis,
and in particular on: approximation theory; the numerical solution of
ordinary and partial differential equations; and integral equations.
There is also research undertaken on statistics.  Research in the
Computer Science Group has three main themes: logic, algebra and
complexity; the theory of distributed systems; and semantics. There is
an active Graduate Programme.

The studentships will be awarded to the best three applicants
regardless of subject area.  Candidates should identify their
preferred area of research and supervisor.  Details of the possible
areas of research and supervisors are available via the Departmental
web pages [http://www.mcs.le.ac.uk] or the Department's Postgraduate
Brochure.  The Postgraduate Brochure, application forms and further
details are available from Dr. S.J. Ambler, Department of Mathematics
and Computer Science, Leicester University, University Road, Leicester
LE1 7RH (telephone: 0116 252 3406, email: s.ambler@mcs.le.ac.uk).

The closing date for applications is 1st May 1998.

From: Michael Barr <barr@triples.math.mcgill.ca>

 Triples is back, at least for the time being, after having been down,
 either from its problems or the lack of power at McGill for most of the
 last month.
 
 I have just seen the question about pullback of tripleable functors and
 I have not seen a really satisfactory reply.  A lot--maybe all--of what
 I say below is probably in Ernie Manes' thesis (A Triple Miscellany,
 Wesleyan U., 1967).  The answer is definitely no, but the problem is the
 lack of adjoint.  Consider, for the example, the complete semilattice
 triple on Set.  It is also the covariant powerset triple, with singleton
 for eta and union (or intersection) for mu (one will give you sup
 semilattices, the other the inf semilattices).  That is one triple and
 the other is N x -, whose algebras are sets with a single unary
 operation.  The pullback is the category whose objects are complete
 semilattices with a single unary function that is not assumed to cohere
 in any way with the semilattice structure.  A complete boolean algebra
 is model of such a theory, taking complement as the unary operation.  If
 there were free algebras of this type, then a quotient of them would be
 a free complete boolean algebra, but we know these don't exist.
 
 Of course, one can raise the question under the assumption that the
 adjoint exists.  For example, if the category is locally presentable
 (complete and accessible) and the functors are accessible.  Then if the
 functors are T_1 and T_2, simply apply them alternately, taking colimits
 at limit ordinals, until they stabilize and that will give you free
 algebras.  Of course, it is obvious that the pullback is the category
 whose objects consist of T_1A ---> A <--- T_2A which are algebras for
 each triple, but no assumption of coherence between the two structures
 is made.  It seems pretty obvious, although I have no really checked the
 details carefully, that this will satisfy Beck's condition.  Or rather
 the forgetful functor to each of the individual category of algebras as
 well as the composite.  For example, if we had the situation
            T_1A -----------> A <------------- T_2A
             ||               ||                ||
             ||               ||                ||
             ||               ||                ||
             ||               ||                ||
             ||               ||                ||
             ||               ||                ||
             vv               vv                vv
            T_1B -----------> B <------------- T_2B
 of such a nature that A ======> B -----> C is a split coequalizer, then
 the outer columns of
            T_1A -----------> A <------------- T_2A
             ||               ||                ||

             |                |                 |
             |                |                 |

             v                v                 v
            T_1C - - - - - -> C <- - - - - - - T_2C
 are split coequalizers too, whence the dotted arrows exist.  That the
 whole diagram is a coequalizer in the pullback category is also easy.
 Thus the answer is yes, provided the adjoint exists, but that is not
 guaranteed even over Set.

Mike is right. The problem lies in the existence of a left adjoint. However
if one pulls back over a Grothendieck co-(=op-)fibration, then if U has a
left adjoint, then so does its pullback. In fact, a functor is a
cofibration iff it is universal for this property, i.e., it has this
property and this property is stable under arbitrary pullbacks."A
cofibration is a universal change of base for right adjoints". I don't know
if this is of much help, but it is amusing.

I am not participating in any journal published by a commercial publisher,
either as author, refereee or editor.  I make an exception for JPAA, but
only for historical reasons and even there I will neither be an author nor
referee.  This is a protest against the price gouging that the commercial
publishers, and Kluwer is one of the worst, have engaged in in recent
years.  Moreover, my univerity will not subscribe to any new commercial
journal.

      The 66th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic 
                    March 28-29, 1998
                    
                 University of Birmingham
                         England 

The 66th meeting of the PSSL will be held at the University of
Birmingham, England, over the weekend of 28-29 March 1998. Since its
inception, the focus of the PSSL has broadened and now includes talks
related to category theory, logic and theoretical computer
science. The meetings are informal in nature and talks on work in
progress is welcome.

We have arranged bed and breakfast in the University House which will
cost 23 pounds per night. In addition, a buffet lunch and tea/coffee
will be provided on Saturday and Sunday at a cost of 8 pounds per
day. Student participation is particularly encouraged at this
meeting and hence we have been granted a small fund to help with the
costs of attendence for students. Those interested in this offer
should contact the organisers as soon as possible.

A more detailed announcement will be made closer to the meeting.

ABSTRACTS:


Higher Dimensional Peiffer Elements in Simplicial Commutative
Algebras 

Z. Arvasi and T. Porter 

Let E be a simplicial commutative algebra such that E_n is generated by
degenerate elements. It is shown that in this case the n^th term of the
Moore complex of E is generated by images of certain pairings from lower
dimensions. This is then used to give a description of the boundaries in
dimension n-1 for n = 2, 3, and 4. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doctrines whose structure forms a fully faithful adjoint string 

F. Marmolejo 

We pursue the definition of a KZ-doctrine in terms of a fully faithful
adjoint string Dd -| m -| dD. We give the definition in any Gray-category.
The concept of algebra is given as an adjunction with invertible counit.
We show that these doctrines are instances of more general pseudomonads.
The algebras for a pseudomonad are defined in more familiar terms and
shown to be the same as the ones defined as adjunctions when we start with
a KZ-doctrine. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note on a theorem of Putnam's 

Michael Barr 

In a 1981 book, H. Putnam claimed that in a pure relational language
without equality, for any model of a relation that was neither empty nor
full, there was another model that satisfies the same first order
sentences. Ed Keenan observed that this was false for finite models since
equality is a definable predicate in such cases. This note shows that
Putnam's claim is true for infinite models, although it requires a more
sophisticated proof than the one outlined by Putnam. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lax Operad Actions and Coherence for Monoidal n-Categories,
A_{\infty} Rings and Modules 

Gerald Dunn 

We establish a general coherence theorem for lax operad actions on an
n-category which implies that an n-category with such an action is lax
equivalent to one with a strict action. This includes familiar coherence
results (e.g. for symmetric monoidal categories) and many new ones. In
particular, any braided monoidal n-category is lax equivalent to a strict
braided monoidal n-category. We also obtain coherence theorems for
A_{\infty} and E_{\infty} rings and for lax modules over such rings. 
Using these results we give an extension of Morita equivalence to
A_{\infty} rings and some applications to infinite loop spaces and
algebraic K-theory. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proof theory for full intuitionistic linear logic, bilinear logic, and
MIX categories 

J.R.B. Cockett and R.A.G. Seely 

This note applies techniques we have developed to study coherence in
monoidal categories with two tensors, corresponding to the tensor-par
fragment of linear logic, to several new situations, including Hyland and
de Paiva's Full Intuitionistic Linear Logic (FILL), and Lambek's Bilinear
Logic (BILL). Note that the latter is a noncommutative logic; we also
consider the noncommutative version of FILL. The essential difference
between FILL and BILL lies in requiring that a certain tensorial strength
be an isomorphism. In any FILL category, it is possible to isolate a full
subcategory of objects (the ``nucleus'') for which this transformation is
an isomorphism. In addition, we define and study the appropriate
categorical structure underlying the MIX rule. For all these structures,
we do not restrict consideration to the ``pure'' logic as we allow
non-logical axioms. We define the appropriate notion of proof nets for
these logics, and use them to describe coherence results for the
corresponding categorical structures. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reflectiveness of covering morphisms in algebra and
geometry 

G. Janelidze and G. M. Kelly 

Each full reflective subcategory X of a finitely-complete category C gives
rise to a factorization system (E, M) on C, where E consists of the
morphisms of C inverted by the reflexion I : C --> X. Under a simplifying
assumption which is satisfied in many practical examples, a morphism f : A
--> B lies in M precisely when it is the pullback along the unit \etaB : B
--> IB of its reflexion If : IA --> IB;  whereupon f is said to be a
trivial covering of B. Finally, the morphism f : A --> B is said to be a
covering of B if, for some effective descent morphism p : E --> B, the
pullback p^*f of f along p is a trivial covering of E. This is the
absolute notion of covering; there is also a more general relative one,
where some class \Theta of morphisms of C is given, and the class Cov(B)
of coverings of B is a subclass -- or rather a subcategory -- of the
category C \downarrow B \subset C/B whose objects are those f : A --> B
with f in \Theta. Many questions in mathematics can be reduced to asking
whether Cov(B) is reflective in C \downarrow B; and we give a number of
disparate conditions, each sufficient for this to be so. In this way we
recapture old results and establish new ones on the reflexion of local
homeomorphisms into coverings, on the Galois theory of commutative rings,
and on generalized central extensions of universal algebras. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crossed squares and 2-crossed modules of commutative
algebras 

Zekeriya Arvasi 

In this paper, we construct a neat description of the passage from crossed
squares of commutative algebras to 2-crossed modules analogous to that
given by Conduche in the group case.  We also give an analogue, for
commutative algebra, of T. Porter's simplicial groups to n-cubes of groups
which implies an inverse functor to Conduche's one. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monads and interpolads in bicategories 

Jurgen Koslowski 

Given a bicategory, 2, with stable local coequalizers, we construct a
bicategory of monads Y-mnd by using lax functors from the generic 0-cell,
1-cell and 2-cell, respectively, into Y. Any lax functor into Y factors
through Y-mnd and the 1-cells turn out to be the familiar bimodules. The
locally ordered bicategory rel and its bicategory of monads both fail to
be Cauchy-complete, but have a well-known Cauchy-completion in common.
This prompts us to formulate a concept of Cauchy-completeness for
bicategories that are not locally ordered and suggests a weakening of the
notion of monad. For this purpose, we develop a calculus of general
modules between unstructured endo-1-cells. These behave well with respect
to composition, but in general fail to have identities. To overcome this
problem, we do not need to impose the full structure of a monad on
endo-1-cells. We show that associative coequalizing multiplications
suffice and call the resulting structures interpolads. Together with
structure-preserving i-modules these form a bicategory Y-int that is
indeed Cauchy-complete, in our sense, and contains the bicategory of
monads as a not necessarily full sub-bicategory. Interpolads over rel are
idempotent relations, over the suspension of set they correspond to
interpolative semi-groups, and over spn they lead to a notion of
``category without identities'' also known as ``taxonomy''. If Y locally
has equalizers, then modules in general, and the bicategories Y-mnd and
Y-int in particular, inherit the property of being closed with respect to
1-cell composition. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On property-like structures 

G. M. Kelly and Stephen Lack 

A category may bear many monoidal structures, but (to within a unique
isomorphism) only one structure of `category with finite products'. To
capture such distinctions, we consider on a 2-category those 2-monads for
which algebra structure is essentially unique if it exists, giving a
precise mathematical definition of `essentially unique' and investigating
its consequences. We call such 2-monads property-like. We further consider
the more restricted class of fully property-like 2-monads, consisting of
those property-like 2-monads for which all 2-cells between (even lax)
algebra morphisms are algebra 2-cells. The consideration of lax morphisms
leads us to a new characterization of those monads, studied by Kock and
Zoberlein, for which `structure is adjoint to unit', and which we now call
lax-idempotent 2-monads: both these and their colax-idempotent duals are
fully property-like. We end by showing that (at least for finitary
2-monads) the classes of property-likes, fully property-likes, and
lax-idempotents are each coreflective among all 2-monads. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Closed model categories for [n,m] types 

J. Ignacio Extremiana Aldana, Luis J. Hernandez Paricio, Maria T. Rivas
Rodriguez 

For m >= n > 0, a map f between pointed spaces is said to be a weak
[n,m]-equivalence if f induces isomorphisms of the homotopy groups \pi_k
for n <= k <= m~. Associated with this notion we give two different closed
model category structures to the category of pointed spaces. Both
structures have the same class of weak equivalences but different classes
of fibrations and therefore of cofibrations. Using one of these
structures, one obtains that the localized category is equivalent to the
category of n-reduced CW-complexes with dimension less than or equal to
m+1 and m-homotopy classes of cellular pointed maps. Using the other
structure we see that the localized category is also equivalent to the
homotopy category of (n-1)-connected (m+1)-coconnected CW-complexes. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multilinearity of Sketches 

David B. Benson 

We give a precise characterization for when the models of the tensor
product of sketches are structurally isomorphic to the models of either
sketch in the models of the other. For each base category K call the just
mentioned property (sketch) K-multilinearity. Say that two sketches are
K-compatible with respect to base category K just in case in each K-model,
the limits for each limit specification in each sketch commute with the
colimits for each colimit specification in the other sketch and all limits
and colimits are pointwise. Two sketches are K-multilinear if and only if
the two sketches are K-compatible. This property then extends to strong
Colimits of sketches. 

We shall use the technically useful property of limited completeness and
completeness of every category of models of sketches. That is, categories
of sketch models have all limits commuting with the sketched colimits and
and all colimits commuting with the sketched limits. Often used
implicitly, the precise statement of this property and its proof appears
here.

Dear Categories,

Two papers about coinduction and guarded induction, one of them
joint work with Martin Escardo, are available from

	http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/duskop/	or
	ftp://ftp.cogs.susx.ac.uk/pub/users/duskop/

*Calculus in coinductive form* is not one of those funny calculi where
you can prove anything, just your old Newton-Leibniz-Taylor-Laplace
calculus, with a special emphasis on Taylor and Laplace, and a bit of
categories.

*Guarded induction*, on the other hand, is this logical principle
whereby, to prove a proposition p, you are allowed to use, among other
things, that very same proposition p --- erm, provided, of course,
that you make sure that it is #guarded#. This gives rise to various
funny calculi, and a bit of categories.

(Proper abstracts follow.)

With best wishes,

	CALCULUS IN COINDUCTIVE FORM
	by D. Pavlovic and M.H. Escardo

	Abstract.

Coinduction is often seen as a way of implementing infinite objects.
Since real numbers are typical infinite objects, it may not come as a
surprise that calculus, when presented in a suitable way, is permeated
by coinductive reasoning.  What *is* surprising is that mathematical
techniques, recently developed in the context of computer science,
seem to be shedding a new light on some basic methods of calculus.

We introduce a coinductive formalization of elementary calculus that
can be used as a tool for symbolic computation, and geared towards
computer algebra and theorem proving.  So far, we have covered parts
of ordinary differential and difference equations, Taylor series,
Laplace transform and the basics of the operator calculus.



===================================================================

	GUARDED INDUCTION ON FINAL COALGEBRAS
	by D. Pavlovic

	Abstract.

We make an initial step towards categorical semantics of guarded
induction. While ordinary induction is usually modelled in terms of
least fixpoints and initial algebras, guarded induction is based on
*unique* fixpoints of certain operations, called guarded, on *final*
coalgebras. So far, such operations were treated syntactically. We
analyse them categorically. Guarded induction appears as couched in
coinduction.

The applications of the presented categorical analysis span across the
gamut of the applications of coinduction, from modelling of
computation to solving differential equations. A subsequent paper will
provide an account of some domain theoretical aspects, which are
presently left implicit.

ESSLLI-98 Workshop on 
                        LOGICAL ABSTRACT MACHINES 
                           August 17 - 21, 1998

                       A workshop held as part of the 
        10th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information 
                               (ESSLLI-98) 
                August 17 - 28, 1998, Saarbrueken, Germany

                        ** SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS **

ORGANISERS: Valeria de Paiva and Eike Ritter (University of Birmingham)

Web site: http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/logmach.html

BACKGROUND:
This workshop brings together recent work on the design of abstract 
machines for functional programming languages based on logical foundations.  
Abstract machines describe implementations of functional languages on a 
level of abstraction which is high enough to make it possible to reason 
about the implementation but low enough as to allow an easy coding of the 
abstract machine.  The workshop is aimed at students and researchers with a 
basic understanding of functional programming and intuitionistic logic who 
want to work on the exciting field of programming with a solid logical 
basis.

We focus the workshop along two main themes: explicit substitutions and 
abstract machines based on Linear Logic.  Most of the more recent work on 
abstract machines is directed towards implementing and proving correct 
functional languages based on Linear Logic ideas.  Linear Logic, being a 
resource logic, was deemed ideal to model resource control in functional 
languages.

FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP:
The workshop consists of five sessions of 90 minutes and time will be 
allocated according to the quality of the submissions.  We seek original 
papers on the full spectrum of abstract machines from theory to 
application.  Among the topics of interest are:

  Theory                                Design and Implementation
  ------                                -------------------------
  formal semantics                      description of working systems
  explicit substitution  calculi        combinators
  type theory                           graph reduction techniques
  linear decorations                    run-time/memory management
  game theory for linear logic          applications
                
SUBMISSIONS:
All researchers in the area, but especially Ph.D.  students and young 
researchers, are encouraged to submit an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) 
and preferably in postscript A4 format by

          **February 15, 1998**

From: Martin Escardo <mhe@dcs.ed.ac.uk>

Dear toposophers,

Every sober space has a smallest dense perfect subspace.  In many
cases this is precisely the subspace of maximal points in the
specialization order. In general it is larger than that.

This is approached via locales. Every locale A has a smallest dense
perfect sublocale, which is spatial if A is. It is obtained by the
perfect coreflection of the double negation nucleus. 

The construction seems to generalize from locales to toposes. But what
does it produce (instead of subspaces of maximal points)? And what is
its logical content? Could toposes of sheaves help one to understand
this?

Thanks in advance for any clue. Details follow.

Martin Escardo
---------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Every finite T_0 space has a smallest dense subspace, namely its
subspace of maximal points in the specialization order. And every
locale has a smallest dense sublocale, induced by the double negation
nucleus, as it is well known. But it is also well known that this is
hardly ever spatial, even if the given locale is. I have considered a
modification of this construction.

Let's say that a nucleus on a locale is perfect if it preserves
directed joins. If we say that a perfect map is a continuous map
f:A->B such that the right adjoint f_*:O(A)->O(B) of the frame map
f^*:O(B)->O(A) preserves directed joins, then a nucleus is perfect iff
it is induced by a perfect map. Let's also say that a sublocale is
perfect if the inclusion is perfect.

It turns out that every locale has a smallest dense perfect sublocale.
Classically, one can show that spatial locales are closed under
perfect sublocales.  Hence every sober space has a smallest dense
perfect sober subspace. This goes as follows.

One knows that the set NA of nuclei on a locale A, with the pointwise
ordering, is a frame. Denote by FA the set of perfect nuclei. Then one
can show that FA is a subframe of NA. (The join of a set of perfect
nuclei is computed by taking the pointwise (directed) join of the
finite compositions of the given nuclei.)  [[Digression: F is
functorial on the category of compact and stably locally compact
locales with perfect maps. For such a locale A, the locale FA is
compact regular, and if A is compact regular then FA=A. For example,
if A is the topology of lower semicontinuity (=Scott topology) on the
unit interval, then FA is the Euclidean topology on the unit
interval. But this is another story.]]

Thus, there is a coreflective adjunction between FA and NA, which in
one way includes FA into NA and in the other assigns to each nucleus
in NA the join of the perfect nuclei below it. (If A is compact and
stably locally compact then there is a simple formula for the perfect
coreflection of nuclei on A.)

Thus the smallest dense perfect sublocale is induced by the perfect
coreflection of the double negation nucleus. But what is it?  Let's
call it the support of A and denote it by Supp A. The support always
contains the subspace of maximal points (oh, I should say Max Pt A is
included in Pt Supp A---but I'll refer to a locale as space for
terminological simplicity).

In many cases it consists exactly of the maximal points. For instance,
if A is compact and stably locally compact then this is the case iff
the subspace of maximal points is compact, and in this case Supp A is
a compact regular locale. (I observe at this point that compact stably
locally compact locales are closed under perfect sublocales). Some
examples and counterexamples can be useful: (i) Let A be the Scott
topology induced by the prefix order on finite and infinite sequences
over {0,1}. Then Supp A is the topology of Cantor space. (ii) Same but
sequences over natural numbers. Then Supp A = A, and not Baire space
as one could expect from the previous example, because Baire space
fails badly to be locally compact. (iii) Let A be the Scott topology
on compact real intervals ordered by reverse inclusion. Then Supp A is
the topology of the Euclidean real line. (iv) The previous example
doesn't fit in the above characterization as it is not compact. If we
add an artificial bottom interval, then we get a compact stably
locally compact locale. But Supp A is then the topology of the
Euclidean real line with a bottom element in the specialization
order---bottom doesn't get removed in this case. (v) Let UA be the
upper power locale of a compact regular locale A. Then Supp UA = A.
This again fits in the above characterization. 

(The above claims [[except the ones in double brackets]] are proved in
the paper "Properly injective spaces and functions spaces", which
should have been called "Perfectly injective spaces and function
spaces". It is going to appear soon. Meanwhile it is available at
http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mhe/pub/papers/injective.ps.gz)

--------------------------
Some questions to finish:
--------------------------

Perfect double negation on the topology of a space removes the partial
points of the space in many cases. What does it do to toposes?  Any
clue is very much appreciated.

In another direction, double negation takes us from intuitionistic
logic to classical logic. Is that behind any correlation
intuitionistic logic<->partiality, classical logic<->totality? Can we
make this precise by taking toposes of sheaves?

The inclusion s:A->Supp A, being a continuous map, induces a geometric
morphism S=Shv(s):Shv(A)->Shv(Supp A). Since s_* preserves directed
joins, one could guess that S_* preserves directed colimits. Would
that be the case? Have these "perfect" geometric morphisms been
studied?

Dear colleagues,

A research position in mathematics has been opened in Louvain-la-Neuve.

It is a two-year position with a salary (free of taxes) of FB 40,000 per
month. After these two years, there are good possibilities to obtain a
six-year assistantship position, with then a salary of FB 50,000 per month.

Candidates must have a degree in mathematics and good academic results.
For the two-year position now open, there are no teaching duties; thus no
knowledge of French is required.

The successful candidate will enter the local research group in
category theory with the aim of preparing a Ph.D. in this area.
He must be ready to start working as soon as possible, and not beyond the
beginning of next academic year.

Please, contact me if you know anybody interested.

Subject: FOM: Set Theory Axioms

The point of this posting is to give some entirely conventional axioms for
set theory that are a bit simpler than many that are normally given. They
are fully formal. By comparison, look at the axioms of elementary topoi
that are given in MacLane/Moerdijk, Sheaves in Geometry and Logic, A first
Introduction to Topos Theory, Springer-Verlag, 1994, on p. 163. The
difference in complexity is strikingly grotesque.

I challenge anyone to write down their favorite fully formal axioms for
topoi that are sufficient to do real analysis, so we can compare them side
by side with the fully formal axioms I write down here.

Topos theory with natural number object is insufficient to develop
undergraduate real analysis - although many fom postings conceal this fact.
One has to add to topoi: natural number object, well pointedness, and
choice. The latter two are nothing more than slavish translations of set
theory into the topos framework. The "idea" is to take a fatally flawed
foundational idea and force it to "work" by transporting important ideas
from set theoretic foundations.

But the axioms of elementary topoi are already incomparably more
complicated than the axioms for set theory presented here.

Let me start with the dramatically simple axioms of finite set theory.
These amazingly simple axioms are tremendously powerful. We work in the
usual classical predicate calculus with equality and one binary relation
symbol epsilon - which we abbreviate here by "in." It is also useful to use
the constant symbol 0 (for the empty set), the unary function symbol { }
(for singletons), and the binary function symbol U (for pairwise union).
Note that axioms 2-4 amount to the most trivial of definitions.

1. (forall x)(x in a iff x in b) implies a = b.
2. (forall x)(not(x in 0)).
3. x in {a} iff x = a.
4. x in a U b if and only if (x in a or x in b).
5. [phi(0) & (forall x,y)((phi(x) & phi(y)) implies phi(x U {y}))] implies
phi(x).

Here phi(x) is any formula in the language in which y is not free.

That's all! One ***derives*** pairing, union, power set, foundation,
replacement, and choice, from these axioms alone!!! Also, when
appropriately formalized, "every set is finite" and things like "every set
has a transitive closure." These axioms are "practically" complete - an
informal concept that I have alluded to before on the fom.

Now for ZFC. We take a different tack and only use epsilon.

1. (forall x)(x in a iff x in b) implies a = b.
2. (therexists x)(a in x & b in x).
3. (therexists x)(forall y in a)(forall z in y)(z in x).
4. (therexists x)(forall y)((forall z in a)(z in y) implies y in x).
5. (forall x,y)(x in y implies (therexists z in y)(forall w in z)(w notin y)).
6. (therexists x,y)(x in y & (forall z in y)(therexists w in y)(z in w)).
7. (therexists x)(forall y)(y in x iff (y in a & phi)), where phi is any
formula in the language in which x is not free.
8. (forall x in a)(therexists y)(phi) & (forall x,y,z)((phi(x,z) &
phi(y,z)) implies x = y) implies (therexists w)(forall x in a)(therexists
unique y in w)(phi),

A novelty is the axiom of infinity, 6, is simpler than usual; and also
choice and replacement are combined nicely by 8. This allows such a simple
axiomatization in purely primitive notation. Try to right down the axioms
of a topos with natural number object, well pointed, and choice, in simple
primitive notation!! Good luck.

As is well known, ZFC is "practically" complete.

The version in the book on p.163 - which does not even include natural
number object, well pointedness, or choice - requires a very substantial
amount of preliminary abbreviations in order to formalize.

Dear Fellow Categorists:

	I am personally not likely to take up Harvey Friedman's challenge, 
having long been doing "category theory as algebra" rather than "category
theory as foundations".

	I would like to point out, though that Friedman has deliberately chosen
as a test case real analysis, a subject which exists only to simulate the
existence of fluxions on the basis of foundations tied to two-valued logic.
How about asking Friedman to give an elegant, elementary foundation for
rings satisfying the Kock-Lawvere axioms?

	The use of an axiom schema in which arbitrarily complex formulae 
may be subsituted also seems a bit of a dodge.  At first glance, elementary
topoi plus  NNO, well-pointed and choice still doesn't need such things
(but I could be wrong, not having thought much about it for years).

Best Thoughts,
David Yetter

I guess simplicity is in the eye of the beholder.  For example, I do not
consider the categorical version of either choice (epis split) or
well-pointed (1 is a generator) to be translations of set theory, but
perfectly natural categorical axioms.  The point is that Harvey is a
set-theorist, so he thinks comprehension and all that stuff (which at
least 95% of all mathematicians could not state properly if their lives
depended on it) is perfectly natural and I don't.  

But my actual criticism of ZF(C) is much simpler.  I have taught these
courses in set theory and we spend a lot of time developing these epsilon
trees and then totally ignore the structure.  In other words, the epsilon
tree structure of sets is totally irrelevant to what you do with them.
There are a number of definitions of pairs, but they are irrelevant.  The
only thing we need to know about pairs (and the only thing a categoriest
does know) is when two pairs are equal.  All the defintions of pairs have
that property of course, but they also have irrelevant properties.

What on earth does Friedman mean by complicated? As Peter Freyd
pointed out a long time ago, the axioms for an elementary topos are
essentially algebraic -- that is, they live at a very low level
of logical complexity. The very first axiom in anyone's (including
Friedman's) axiomatization of set theory is the axiom of
extensionality, which is not expressible even in coherent logic
(at least, not unless you take not-membership as a primitive
predicate, on the same level as membership).

Unless Friedman can put forward an objective measure of complexity
(as opposed to "unfamiliarity to H. Friedman") which justifies the
above quote, then his challenge is not worth considering.

The slavish translation of well pointedness and choice actually arises from
a more subtle slavish translation of point-set topology.

Point-set topology postulates that the points of a topological space can be
comprehended as a set, but this apparently innocuous idea is questionable
(perhaps we should be more sceptical about what sets can comprehend
following our experience with proper classes).

When we formulate our foundations based on the ideas of topos theory, and
interpret "set" as object in an elementary topos, then - given a natural
numbers object - we can ideed construct "sets of reals" but we find that
they misbehave. Normal theorems of analysis, such as Heine-Borel, fail
unless we also impose the additional ideas from set-theoretic foundations.

However, there is a different way of formulating topology, using locales or
"formal spaces", that works in any elementary topos (still need an NNO to
get the reals, of course) and preserves the validity of theorems such as
Heine-Borel. It works by addressing the topology directly, without regard
to what the opens in it might be sets of. It still has a concept of point,
but generalized point with respect to a varying set-theory (stage of
definition) instead in a fixed one. We can't take a single comprehension in
our favourite set-theory as encompassing all the points.

The moral is that a topological space is more than just a set of points
together with a topology of open subsets. If, for any reasons at all, we
are interested in doing mathematics constructively, then we should discard
point-set topology and use locales.

My picture of what is going on is this: when we try to make a set out of a
space by stripping off the topology, we damage the points, and we put the
well-pointedness and choice in as crutches and plasters to try to rectify
the damage we should never have done in the first place.

How does Harvey Friedman know that the formulation of real analysis as 
carried out in set theory will do all that real analysis *should* do? 

My favourite example is that of partial functions. Most teachers of real 
analysis (calculus) rightly impress on students the importance of the domain 
of a function, 
and the domain of f+g, etc. So a student might think that the algebra and 
analysis of partial functions would occupy a good part of the literature. 
Solutions of ODEs (such as dy/dx=exp(-y) ) are often given by partial 
functions 
with domain involving a parameter, and the solution (including its 
domain) seems to vary smoothly with this parameter. In fact there is very 
little in the literature on such matters. I had a small go with 
29. (with A.M. ABD-ALLAH), ``A compact-open topology on partial maps with 
open domain'', {\em J. London Math Soc.} (2) 21 (1980) 480-486. 

It is not clear that the most general case of 
the functional analysis of partial functions with domain neither open nor 
closed can be successfully handled within classical set theory. There is 
a chance it can be handled within topos theory. (Try functions defined on 
the leaves of foliations. Any answers?) 

Another point of topos theory is to handle categories such as that of 
directed graphs in a similar manner to the category of sets, and to make 
comparisons between such categories. (Bill Lawvere has of course written 
a lot on this.)

According to Harvey Friedman:

> by side with the fully formal axioms I write down here.

The papers I announced here the other day do not offer any such
"dramatically simple" or "tremendously powerful" axioms, comparable
with Friedman's, nor indeed anything as politically engaged --- but I
think they may have to do with the issue.

Given a field in any category with enough limits, we implement
analytic functions, solve differential equations --- do quite a bit of
real analysis. It turns out that most of it can be captured as guarded
induction on final coalgebras.

We did not try to use this to embed real analysis in any fully formal
foundational theory, but to provide a uniform way of implementing it
on a computer, together with infinitary constructions and all. The
result may not be as "amazingly simple" as Friedman's axioms, but it
is fairly simple, and conceptually clear. Check it out (the last two
papers at http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/duskop/).

Sorry for the plug, but I actually want to make a point. I don't think
category theory should spend time trying to beat set theory on its own
territory of fully formal systems. Sets were invented in the time of
doubt about the consistency of mathematics, when foundations were
really sought for. Nowadays people go and prove Fermat Theorem.

Set theory wants to be something like a formal grammar of
mathematics. That is fine, can be very interesting in itself, but
great stories are usually told without thinking of grammar.

Category theory might perhaps do better to try to be some kind of a
programming language or mathematics, a set of object-(or better:
method-)oriented tools, conceptualizing large "software" projects of
the day.

How about that?

as manifolds. Next time they need foundations, they'll invent them
again, like they invented sets and sheaves.

Friedman, H.(1-OHS); Flagg, R. C.(1-SME)
A framework for measuring the complexity of mathematical concepts.
(English)
Adv. in Appl. Math. 11 (1990), no. 1, 1--34.
  _________________________________________________________________

This paper presents a system $\scr F\sb 0(\scr B)$ that is intended to
allow practical computation of the complexity of mathematical
concepts. $\scr F\sb 0(\scr B)$ is an untyped theory of sets and
partial functions in a first-order free logic with equality and a
description operator. Its language $\scr L\sb 0(\scr B)$ contains many
primitive operations, such as $n$-tuples, lambda abstraction,
comprehension terms, finite set and Cartesian product formation, and
definition by cases. $\scr B$ denotes a set of "descriptive forms"
that are patterns according to which new constants, functions, and
predicates can be defined. After a rigorous presentation of the syntax
of $\scr L\sb 0(\scr B)$, standard programming language procedures
yield parsing and recognition algorithms. A precise semantics for
$\scr L\sb 0(\scr B)$ is given, followed by a deductive system $\scr
F\sb 0(\scr B)$ that is shown to be complete by means of a
Henkin-style proof. Finally, the authors introduce the notions of
definition sequence, definition dag (directed acyclic graph), and
definition tree. On the basis of these notions, they promise that, in
a future paper, they will develop measures of complexity of
definitions that will make possible practical calculation of the
complexity of concepts in a large part of current mathematical
practice.

From: Mary Sheeran <ms@cs.chalmers.se>

The Department of Computing Science at the Chalmers University of
Technology and Göteborgs University announces free PhD positions.

The major research topics at the department are programming logic and type
theory, functional programming, concurrency, fault tolerant distributed
systems, formal methods, cognition technology, and algorithms and discrete
optimisation, but research is also carried out in a number of other
topics. More information about the research at the department can be found
on the WWW on page:
 
  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/ComputingScience/Research

Most PhD positions are five year scholarships. The PhD student will
spend about 80 percent of his or her time on graduate studies, and
about 20 percent on teaching. Applicants must have an undergraduate
degree in Computer Science with excellent results. The department
tries to increase the number of female employees, and especially
welcomes female applicants. At the moment the scholarships consists of
15400 (18000) SEK per month in the first (last) year. Usually a
foreign PhD student does not teach in his or her first year in Sweden,
and as a consequence the scholarship is of a slightly smaller size.

More information about the graduate programmes can be found on the WWW
on page:

  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Grad/gradinfo/gradinfo.html

To apply, send us a letter in English, covering 

  1 data about yourself;
  2 a copy of an official paper giving grades from your undergraduate
    degree(s); 
  3 a statement about your main interests and your plans for research;
  4 some letters of recommendation from people that know you as a student
    or as an employee;
  5 any scientific papers you have written.

Send your application to 

  Director of Graduate Studies
  Department of Computing Science
  Chalmers University of Technology
  412 96 Göteborg
  Sweden

Furthermore, send an email containing the data about yourself to 

  ms@cs.chalmers.se

The last date for your application to arrive is March 2, 1998. A
decision about to whom we will offer the PhD positions will be taken
before June 1, 1998.

There seems some confusion as to whether Left Kan extensions are right 
Kan extensions and conversely, and it seems different authors use 
different conventions. 

What do people think of using a terminology analogous to limits and 
colimits, i.e. Kan extensions and Kan coextensions? In particular, what 
Carmody and Walters call left Kan extensions would here be Kan 
coextensions, which can be constructed as coends (as in Mac Lane, CFTWM). 

This point has come from Anne Heyworth, where left Kan extensions use 
right rewriting, if you write composition in a category in the algebraic 
rather than functional way. 

Any other ideas?

Being a newcomer to the category list, I have a really naive and stupid question
(concerning H. Friedman's challenge). Namely, I was always under the impression
that you had to know what a set was before you could talk about what a
category was (in particular a topos). Is it possible to talk about toposes
without knowing what a set is?

This seems somewhat related to a question that has been bugging me for some
time, namely how to talk about a ``category''
which is enhanced over itself, but not necessarily having any functor to or
from Sets. The very first part of the structure would be a class of objects
O
together with a function (x,y)\mapsto H(x,y) from O\times O to O, but I
can't get beyond that.

Hello and goodwill

Now that I have my PhD dissertation submitted, I've had a while to
stand back from the material, and consider the categorial territory
that I stumbled into in the last year or so. Although I'm acquainted
with a mere fraction of the crucial concepts here, what I have found
seems to contain really elegant insights into computer languages, and
I want to clarify these to myself, as a philosophical basis for
future study.

It may well be that it will all be old news here, but the introductory
texts don't spell things out in quite the way I perceive them. (My
reading started out wide, but narrowed down mainly to MacLane, Barr
and Wells, and articles by Ridenour in some S-V workshop proceedings
some years back. Asperti and Longo has been good too.)

To cut to the chase, consider Cartesian closure. If we leave out matters
of storage, scoping and other time-related resources, a Lisp-family
language is lambda-calculus with a reduction policy - that is, a set
of decisions that one expression form is to be replaced by another.
(For Lisp, the policy is to do beta- and eta-reduction in some order
until no more redexes can be found.) And lambda is a CCC with name
binding - as opposed to expressing everything with projectors.

But more: a CCC is defined by adjunctions: unique-terminal, diagonal-
product, product-exponential. These adjunctions define isomorphisms
between expression forms:

	f = n (F g)
	g = (G f) u

where u and n are unit and counit. In other words, the isomorphisms are
determined by natural transformations, of a very simple and intuitive
kind: if you can have one of a thing, you can have two of them; if you
can have one thing and another, you can have both together in a product;
if you have a product expression, then you can have a product expression
constructor (exponential) with one term curried out.

These natural transformations are universal structural operators;
inherently polymorphic or domain-free, in programming terms. And using
only a handful of them, you can define these isomorphisms, which then
constitute an equational theory for a language - in the sense that
lambda is the equational theory behind Lisp.

Whatever can be defined by adjunctions is what they call "referentially
transparent": equals are substituted only for equals. It's stronger than
that, in fact, because with an adjunctive system like this, an expression
can be substituted for another only when there is also a rule for the
reverse substitution. E.g.

	x * x = square x

The referentially-transparent equational theory stands by itself. But on
top of it, we may now impose reduction policies, ("games") of various kinds:

1. We can substitute equals for equals by hand: "just doing algebra".

2. We can specify an algorithm for substitutions: intepreters.

3. We can extend this to interpreters where we introduce new reduction
   rules as we go along: symbolic algebra systems.

4. We can specify a data-directed backtracking algorithm, which is allowed
   to apply a reduction rule in either order: equational logic systems.

5. We can specify a data-directed heuristic backtracking algorithm:
   dunno quite what we call these, maybe constraint systems.

6. We can specify systems which not only use backtracking and heuristics,
   but assert and retract additional rules as we go along: traditional AI.

"Extending the rules" is a dangerous game, of course; you have the
responsibility for maintaining referential transparency. Nobody I've
read has hinted at the possibility of automating the definition of
equational rules by adjunction. Even if such a thing could only be
done in a very restrained sense, though, it would still be very
powerful. Vaguely, I think the rubric has to be: OK, here's the kind
of data we want to work on - regular expressions, perms and coms,
machine code, whatever - now, what are the equivalences we see in
these domains, and are they isomorphisms? And if so, _why_ are they
isomorphisms, and what natural transformations might possibly define
them by adjunction?

The key insight for me, the thing that categories has revealed, is that
reduction polices for equational theories are _the_ bridge between the
declarative and the procedural; and equational theories can be built
by adjunction from universal constructors. It's so beautiful I just
want to sit and gaze at it. It's one of those obvious things that you
see side-on for years, and then suddenly you see it directly.

More later.

     Mathematicians and computer scientists who have developed
a clear vision of the relation between lambda calculus
and cartesian-closed categories, as Jonathan Burns evidently
has, may wish to consider the following PROBLEM:

     1.  There is a great deal of technical development of
the presentational machinery of lambda calculus.

     2.  Lately, there have been interesting advances in the
study of the algebraic theory of exponential rigs, which
Tarski called "the high school" theory. (See papers of
Stanley Burris et al. on counter examples by Wilkie et al.
to naive completeness conjectures.)
    
     3.  There are many objectively (or semantically)
arising examples of cartesian-closed categories in the form
of presheaf toposes, such as that of finite directed graphs
or of discrete dynamical systems (as explained in our recent
elementary book published by Cambridge).

     4.  The rich variety of models mentioned in 3. has apparently
NEVER BEEN DIRECTLY RELATED to the abstract theory of lambda
calculus, nor to the theory of exponential rigs.  In the latter
case, although specific models are of great interest, they
have been constructed by formal syntactical means, rather than
through the "objective number theory" means via Steiner-Cantor-
Burnside-Grothendieck-Schanuel abstraction from these concrete
categories of combinatorial structures, in which the exponent-
iation operation has a very explicit mathematical content and 
construction. Although the exponential rigs capture only
the "existence of isomorphisms" equations between objects
as opposed to the detailed knowledge of given morphisms
(usually not iso) between the combinatorial structures and
the detailed particular operations that lambda calculus 
eventually wants to apply to, nonetheless already at that
level nontrivial equational questions arise.  For example,
there are often "connected" objects A which satisfy equations
B^A + C^A = (B+C)^A, and there are sometimes sufficiently
separating "figures" or "elements" of connected shapes.
As another example, exponential objects occasionally are
actually polynomial in the sense that B^A is actually iso-
morphic to F(A,B) where F is a combination of products and
co-products;  two cases that I know of are, with B = A,
F = 2A^2 and F = 1+A.  The latter has a clear intuitive
interpretation that the only internally definable endomaps
are either identity or constant.  But it is an open PROBLEM
whether there are any other polynomials  F  for which there
exists a finite presheaf topos, in which there exist objects
A enjoying such isomorphisms.

Well the first question has an easy answer.  It is just as possible to
talk about a category without knowing what a set is as it is to talk about
a set without knowing what a set is.  Of course, you cannot talk about
homsets.  It is interesting to read the very first Eilenberg-Mac Lane
paper, which did not talk about homsets.  A set is an undefined notion and
there is a relation, epsilon that may hold between one set and another,
subject to certain axioms, one version of which Friedman listed.  A
category consists of undefined things called arrows and three relations,
two functional and the third partially functional (actually better than
that, but leave that aside).  Friedman's axioms are not coherent, as has
been pointed out, while the categorical axioms are.  On the other hand,
one can state Friedman's axioms, in all their glorious incomprehensibility
(I think I could stare at the 8th one from now until the middle of next
year without understanding what it says, and the 6th, asserted to be the
axiom of infinity is not much clearer) in a couple hundred words, while it
is pretty much necessary to interrupt the topos axioms for some
definitions (at least monic and subobject) to do the topos axioms.  Thus
each one looks simpler to its devotees and there is really no point in
arguing about it.

                      Final Call for Papers

                  Workshop on Generic Programming

                 June 18th 1998, Marstrand, Sweden

    (In Conjunction with Mathematics of Program Construction Conference)


           ----------------------------------------------
           Deadline for submissions: 16th February, 1998.
           ----------------------------------------------

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making them more
general.  A generic program embodies some sort of polymorphism; ordinary 
programs are obtained from it by suitably instantiating its parameters. The
parameters may be other programs, types or type constructors, or even 
programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to 
practitioners and theoreticians, but to date have rarely been a specific 
focus of research.  Recent developments in functional and 
object-oriented programming lead the organizers of this workshop to believe 
that there is sufficient interest to warrant the organisation of a one-day
workshop on the theme of generic programming.  The workshop will be on 
June 18th, 1998, following on from the Mathematics of Program Construction 
conference.  

The goal of the workshop is to inventorise the full diversity of research 
activities in the area of generic programming, both theoretical and applied, 
by attracting as wide a spectrum of participants as possible to the workshop. 
The results of the workshop will be published in the form of a detailed summary
of all presentations, prepared by the organizers and made available on 
internet.

We cordially invite all those with an active interest in this important new 
area to submit a short position paper on their work to Roland Backhouse
(rolandb@win.tue.nl).  The position paper should outline your current research
activities in this area and include references to published papers and/or 
web links to technical reports where more information can be found.  
The recommended length is approximately three pages.  The
deadline for submission is 16th February, 1998.   Notification of acceptance 
will be on or before 15th March, 1998.



The organizers are as follows:

Roland Backhouse (Cochair), Netherlands   Tim Sheard (Cochair), USA
Robin Cockett, Canada                     Barry Jay, Australia
Johan Jeuring, Sweden                     Karl Lieberherr, USA

Subject: Friedman's challenge

The reason why 1970s topos theorists did a "slavish translation"
of well-pointedness, choice, etc is quite simple: it is known
in computer science and engineering as "reverse compatibility".
We (ie Lawvere, Tierney and others) needed to show that whatever
you could allegedly do with set theory, you could do with elementary
toposes too.

Now that reverse compatibility has been achieved, the old methods
are obsolete, and we should be able to move on from there. We 
show that the new methods (by which I mean category theory in general,
not necessarily elementary toposes) are more idiomatic for the
old purposes and more powerful for new ones.

For example we would never have got anywhere with domain models of
polymorphism, or with synthetic domain theory, without category
theory as our guide. I'm sure that most of the readers of "categories"
can add examples from their own interests.

I have a personal reason for bitterly resenting ever being taught
set theory.  (I don't want anybody to interpret that as resentment
towards the particular people in Cambridge who did the teaching -
the problem is with the mathematical community as a whole which has
perpetuated this pernicious theory.)

For several years I was trying to prove (in an elementary topos,
in particular without excluded middle, or the axiom of collection,
which seems to me to be set-theoretic hocus pocus):
	Let (X, <=) be a poset with least element and directed
	joins, and s:X->X a monotone (not necessarily Scott
	continuous) function.  Then s has a least fixed point.
I talked about my attempts at this at at least two international
category meetings and several other project meetings and conferences.

Because of my set-theoretic indoctrination, much as I rebelled
against it, I set about defining ordinal iterates of the function s
and its values at the least element.  The intuitionistic theory of
ordinals is complicated, and there are several flavours of them,
but there is no doubt that ordinals as big as you please exist in
any elementary topos. See JSL 61 (1996) 703-742.

Always with traditional applications of ordinals, the problem is
knowning when to stop.  The textbook solution is due to Friedrich
Hartogs, 1917.  Basically, you take a pair of scissors ... .
Andre Joyal and Ieke Moerdijk have a pair of scissors which make
a cleaner cut (by our standards in category theory), but they too
still chop off the standard sequence.  (Maybe someone would like to
write a PhD thesis which uses their methods to eliminate the set theory
from the "alpha-presentable" versions of Gabriel-Ulmer duality.)

In fact this result has now been proved, by a Georgian called
Dimitri Pataraia.  (I haven't met him, or been able to find out
much about him, despite now sharing an office with another
Georgian).

Pataraia's solution is pure order theory.  You could teach it to
a third year undergraduate class in a course on lattices or domain
theory.  There is not an ordinal in sight.

In fact, looking more closely at his solution, there *are* ordinals
in it.  [My version of] his proof looks remarkably like Zermelo's
second proof of Choice => well ordering.  It may seem strange that
such an infamously classical result should contain a the essence
of an intuitionistic argument, but in fact [Zermelo's version of]
Choice occurs in the first line of the argument and never again.

Zermelo manufactures the required ordinal structure out of the given 
object, whereas the subsequent orthodox approach, due to Hartogs
9 years later, is based on a single monolithic system, which has
to be chopped off in a rather unceremonious fashion.  Ordinals
similar to Zermelo's, though only satisfying the induction scheme
for a restricted class of predicates, and not satisfying any recursion
scheme I can find, are also to be found in Pataraia's proof.

Throughout my (personally unsuccessful) study of this problem,
whenever I sought intuition from set theory it took me in the
WRONG direction.  I cannot think of any other branch of mathematics,
with the exception of infinitessimal calculus before it was reformed,
which I would condemn so utterly.  In fact, 18th century calculus
did give a lot of right answers, and at least its wrong ones were
interesting and provoked good research. 

In answer to Harvey Friedman, I *don't* advocate topos theory
as foundations.  It still reeks of set theory (sorry, Bill).

===================================
Part II (it seems that I originally sent the above to the wrong email alias)

I didn't properly spell out my philosophical conclusions about ordinals.
What I mean is that
	a [not "the"] system of ordinals *ought* to have a top element
	(a fixed point for successor).
In other words, I am contradicting the usual interpretation of the
Burali-Forti paradox, and discarding the tradition of chopping the
monolithic system of ordinals off, as Hartogs, Joyal/Moerdijk and 
many others have done (including me).  The notion of cardinality is
clearly stupid from a categorical point of view (we know better than
to classify objects up to isomorphism, without even any regard to their
automorphism groups) and, as an atheist, I find Cantor's theologically
motivated notion of "size" utterly incomprehensible.  

While I'm at it, I don't accept the argument in either Russell's paradox
(re the set {x:x not in x}) or Cantor's theorem that P(X) =/= X.

It's not that I am particularly keen to have a set of all sets (though
such a thing is probably to be expected from the right logical principles
in much the same way as a universal Turing machine is in recursion theory),
but that I do not consider that these classic arguments ought to be valid.

Andy Pitts and I traced Russell's paradox to a particular quantifier
(in fact in a locally cartesian closed category) - see our paper in
Studia Logica 1989 p 387. It is this quantifier which I reject. In fact
he and I independently had models which had a type of types, and achieved
this by restricting the quantifiers which could be interpreted.

The Burali-Forti paradox goes away too if the class of predicates for
which the induction scheme is valid (in the definition of an ordinal)
is retricted. For example, the domain of increasing natural numbers
plus a fixed point is such an ordinal for Scott-continuous predicates
(the Crole-Pitts FIX object).

I think I may be able to adjust the notion of elementary topos (I prefer
to think in these terms than in symbolic logic) to a useful fragment
in which Cantor's theorem fails.  (Sorry to be so vague, but I haven't
got very far with this, and currently have a head full of perl programming.)

Sammy Eilenberg died today.

He had been unconscious since June. 

Knowing it was inevitable doesn't really help.
