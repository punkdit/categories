     Title: Multiple categories: the equivalence of a globular and a
     cubical approach
     Authors: Fahd A. A. Al-Agl, Ronald Brown, Richard Steiner
     Comments: Latex2E, xy, 38 pages
     Subj-class: Category Theory; Algebraic Topology
     MSC-class: 18D35, 55U99

     We show the equivalence of two kinds of strict multiple category,
namely the well known globular omega-categories, and the cubical
omega-categories with connections. (30kb)

Objectives

Object-based Distributed Computing is being established as the most
pertinent basis for the support of large, heterogeneous computing and
telecommunications systems. Indeed, several important international
organisations, such as ITU, ISO, OMG, TINA-C, etc. are defining similar
distributed object-based frameworks as a foundation for open distributed
computing.

The advent of Open Object-based Distributed Systems - OODS - brings new
challenges and opportunities for the use and development of formal methods.
New architectures and system models are emerging (e.g., the enterprise,
information, computational and engineering viewpoints of the ITU-T/ISO/IEC
ODP Reference Model) which require formal notational support. Usual design
issues such as specification, verification, refinement, and testing need to
take into account new dimensions introduced by distribution and openness,
such as quality of service and dependability constraints, dynamic binding
and reconfiguration, consistency between multiple models and viewpoints,
etc. OODS is a challenging research context and a source of motivation for
semantical models of object-based systems and notations, for the evolution
of standardised formal description techniques, for the application and
assessment of logic based approaches, for better understanding and
information modeling of business requirements, and for the further
development and use of Object Oriented methodologies and tools.

The objective of FMOODS is to provide an integrated forum for the
presentation of research in several related fields, and the exchange of
ideas and experiences in the topics concerned with the formal methods
support for Open Object-based Distributed Systems.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

   * formal models for object-based distributed computing
   * semantics of object-based distributed systems and programming languages
   * formal techniques in object-based and object-oriented specification,
     analysis and design
   * refinement and transformation of specifications
   * types, service types and subtyping
   * interoperability and composability of distributed services
   * object-based coordination languages
   * object-based mobile languages
   * efficient analysis techniques of specifications
   * multiple viewpoint modelling and consistency between different models
   * formal techniques in distributed systems verification and testing
   * specification, verification and testing of quality of service
     constraints
   * formal methods and object life cycle
   * beyond IDL: semantics based specification patterns
   * formal models for measuring the quality of object-oriented requirement
     or design specifications
   * formal aspects of distributed real-time multimedia systems
   * applications to telecommunications and related areas

Coherence, Homotopy and 2-Theories
Authors: Noson S. Yanofsky
Comments: 32 pages; XY-Pic
Subj-class: Category Theory; Quantum Algebra
MSC-class: 18D10; 18C10; 55U35

2-Theories are a canonical way of describing categories with extra structure.
2-theory-morphisms are used when discussing how one structure can be
replaced with another structure. This is central to categorical coherence
theory. We place a Quillen model category structure on the category 
of 2-theories and 2-theory-morphisms where the weak equivalences are 
biequivalences of 2-theories. A biequivalence of 2-theories (Morita equivalence)
induces and is induced by a biequivalence of 2-categories of algebras. This model 
category structure allows one to talk of the homotopy of 2-theories 
and discuss the universal properties of coherence. 



All the best, 
Noson

From: Osher Doctorow, Ph.D. osher@ix.netcom.com, Sat. July 7, 2000, =
9:46AM

Dear Colleagues:

I have been studying the "conversion" from x/y to 1 - x + y and the =
conversion from x/y to x + y - xy, where x and y are elements of any =
category (although in practice I have been restricting attention to =
probability-statistics (x =3D Pr(A), y =3D Pr(AB) where AB is the =
intersection of sets/events A and B) and (fuzzy) multivalued logics such =
as Goguen/Product (G) and Lukaciewicz (L) and Godel (Go)  (in the case =
of G, x/y is the non-trivial implication x --> y and in the case of L, 1 =
- x + y is the non-trivial implication x --> y) and the Jacobson radical =
in ring theory (which is based on the circle composition product x*y =3D =
x + y - xy for x and y elements of the ring) and Fermat's Last Theorem =
in number theory (x and y are integers and a super-super short proof =
seems to depend on generalizing x*y to n dimensions and using the =
conjugate which will be described below).  The conjugate ^ of 1 - x + y =
is (1 - x + y)^ =3D 1 + x - y, and the conjugate of x + y - xy is x + y =
+ xy.    An n dimensional generalization would involve x^^n + y^^n  =
where ^^ is exponentiation (unrelated to ^) since the product of 1 - x + =
y and its conjugate can be shown to involve x^^2 + y^^2 - x^^2 y^^2 =3D =
x^^2 * y^^2 and so on.  The expression "conversion" is used above =
instead of function because y/x --> 1 - x + y is not a function but a =
conversion of the division operation (for x non-zero) to subtraction and =
the addition of 1.    =20

The probability-statistics reader may recognize x/y and (Bayesian) =
conditional probability (BCP for short) written Pr(B/A) for Pr(A) =
non-zero, and it turns out that 1 - x + y for probability-statistics is =
Pr(A-->B) =3D Pr(A' U B) =3D Pr(A' ) + Pr(B) - Pr(A' B) =3D Pr(A' ) + =
Pr(AB) =3D 1 - Pr(A) + P(AB), which latter expression is maximized for =
very rare events and lower dimensional events when probability =
distributions are continuous on a volume of space containing A and B =
(Pr(A) =3D 0 for those cases) and also when A is a subset of B.  =
Pr(A-->B) is abbreviated LBP for logic-based probability, which I have =
been developing since 1980.   BCP applies to frequent/common and =
independent-like or low influence events (including Markov processes =
which have many similarities to independent events although they are =
"slightly" dependent) and LBP applies to rare events or rare-like events =
(Pr(A) less than epsilon for epsilon small positive) and to n-k =
dimensional subset events of n-dimensional Euclidean space for k =3D 0 =
to n and to highly dependent or highly one or two-way influencing =
events.=20

As for Goguen/Product logic (G) and Lukaciewicz logic, their union or =
"join" G U L, similarly to the union or join of either of them with =
Godel logic G, equals BL2, the basic (fuzzy) multi-valued logic which =
generalizes Boolean logic with the deduction Theorem and the plausible =
axiom p V ~p (p or ~p) for each proposition p.   Thus, G and L =
constitute all of the universe of logic in this sense, and they =
partition it into disjoint "roughly equal" parts.

Can anyone tell me what Ehresmann meant by a "saturated functor" (foncteur
saturé) in 1967?

Dear Colleagues:

The "conversions" from x/y to 1 - x + y and from x/y to x + y - xy which =
I introduced here on July 8, 2000 not only can be used across =
probability-statistics and (fuzzy) multivalued logical categories and =
ring theory and number theory categories (Fermat's Last Theorem) as =
indicated in that paper, but they are especially useful in special =
relativity and quantum field theory as well as quantum mechanics as I =
shall show here.  The categories in the latter two fields will be =
discussed in detail later, but here I would like to indicate what =
results are obtained.

Applying the conversion from x/y to 1 - x + y to the Heisenberg =
Uncertainty Principle in the form xy > k where k is a positive constant =
(x, y uncertainties in position and momentum respectively, for example, =
where notice x and y are nonnegative in the standard deviation version =
of uncertainty) yields xy =3D (x/y)y^^2 (where ^^ is exponentiation) --> =
(1 - x + y)y^^2.  For 1 - x + y < 0, which says x > 1 + y, the latter =
expression is negative, so the converted form reads: (1 - x + y)y^^2 =3D =
-/1 - x + y/y^^2 > k and therefore /1 - x + y/y^^2 < -k for k positive.  =
Since y^^2 is always nonnegative, this conditional holds trivially =
(always) provided that x > 1 + y.   Since x and y could be selected with =
exchanged physical roles (uncertainties in momentum and position =
respectively, for example), the condition that x > 1 + y is rather =
arbitrary and certainly will be fulfilled for one of the two orders in =
which x and y are defined.

The conclusion which we must come to is that there are two phases: the =
phase in which the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is satisfied (which =
phase may for example correspond to an interaction between macroscopic =
observation and microscopic phenomena) and the phase in which the =
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is not satisfied (which phrase may =
correspond to two macroscopic or two microscopic observation/phenomena =
pairs or both or some other regime).

A similar but even more explicit results holds when we make the =
conversion in special relativity in the beta or 1/beta Lorentz =
contraction factor sqrt(1 - v^^2/c^^2) where sqrt means square root of.  =
We get 1 - v^^2/c^^2 =3D 1 - (v/c)^^2 =3D 1 - y/x for y =3D v^^2, x =3D =
c^^2 and this goes over to 1 - (1 - x + y =3D x - y.   So beta or 1/beta =
(depending on what notation one uses) goes over to sqrt(x - y).  =
However, it has been pointed out in earlier papers (and it will be =
pointed out again) that the closure law holds in most of the categories =
to which these conversions x/y --> 1 - x + y for example apply, and let =
us assume the same thing here (closure under subtraction means that if x =
and y are in the category or in the set part of the category other than =
the morphism, then x - y and y - x are also in the set part).   =
Therefore, sqrt(y - x) is an alternate form of the result for beta or =
1/beta, and since sqrt (y - x) is imaginary when y < x and real when y < =
x, it must be that the real and imaginary scales are themselves =
arbitrary.  In more common terminology, they merely measure different =
phases in the sense of liquid-solid-gas etc.

Thus, not only can the speed of light be exceeded (although the object =
exceeding it enters a different phase), but the Heisenberg Uncertainty =
Principle can be violated (but the objects violating it enter different =
phases).    This is not surprising in view of the superluminal group =
velocity results obtained in 1997 and later experiments by Nimtz in =
Cologne/Koln and Berkeley and elsewhere (which according to Nimtz are =
also applicable to ordinary velocities).  It is also not surprising in =
view of M. Jammer's comprehensive analysis (The Philosophy of Quantum =
Mechanics, Wiley: New York 1974) of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle =
in which it is found that the principle does not apply to individual =
measurements of physical objects but to statistical summaries of their =
uncertainties (Schrodinger in fact proved that on Hilbert Space =
self-adjoint operators obey this inequality for the product of their =
uncertainties, but Banach Space is far more general than Hilbert Space =
and gives enough room by far to define or contain a second phase sets of =
objects - which may not be operators in the usual sense).

The implications for special relativity and for quantum field theory =
(which combines quantum mechanics with special relativity) are obviously =
serious, although not necessarily catastrophic.   It just means that =
these theories are again approximations to one or two states or category =
of states of physical objects but not to more general or different =
categories of states of physical objects.  Since light itself satisfies =
both categories (sqrt (1 -(c^^2/c^^2)) is 0 which can be regarded as =
both real and imaginary), there certainly is at least one non-empty =
element in each category.

Dear Colleagues:

The Jacobson radical that I have been mentioning in the last several =
communications, and which is defined in terms of the circle composition =
product x * y =3D x + y - xy, is related to category theory by M. W. =
Gray (Pacific Jour. Math 1967, vol. 23, 79-89 and her book A radical =
approach to algebra, Addison-Wesley: Reading, 1970.  In particular, the =
semiabelian category was introduced by her to include various of the =
radicals including the Jacobson radical.  A very accessible detailed =
presentation of her work and those of others up to 1994 is T. W. Palmer =
Banach algebras and the general theory of *-algebras volume I: algebras =
and Banach algebras, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, which is =
part of the exceptionally valuable Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its =
Applications of the Cambridge University Press (not of course a usual =
encyclopedia - the name is used for numerous separate books of the =
highest quality on crucial mathematical subjects important in the latest =
rsearch).   See especially sections 4.3 and 4.7.

I will give more details on this at a future time.

Hello,

I´m beginning a MSc course on Computer Science. I started working with
categories (specially topos)and coherence spaces and I´m looking for some
papers and basic references on this subject. I´d be glad if you could help
me. The main goal of my work is to define the categories (or
subcategories) of STAB (coherence spaces and stable functions) and LIN
(coherence spaces and linear functions) as Topos.

Any suggestions are welcome.
Thanks in advance,
Simone Costa.

Let C be a category and F, G : C -> C be endo-functors.
I denote the category of all F-algebras by Alg_C F and
the canonical forgettable functor by U_F : Alg_C F -> C.

I'm interested in concrete functors 

	H : Alg_C F -> Alg_C G

where `concrete' indicates the property

	U_F = U_G . H


Does anybody know about such functors?

Thanks for any help/references!

Applying the conversion from x/y to 1 - x + y to the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle in the form xy > k where k is a positive constant (x, y
uncertainties in position and momentum respectively, for example, where
notice x and y are nonnegative in the standard deviation version of
uncertainty) yields xy = (x/y)y^^2 (where ^^ is exponentiation) --> (1 - x +
y)y^^2.  For 1 - x + y < 0, which says x > 1 + y, the latter expression is
negative, so the converted form reads: (1 - x + y)y^^2 = -/1 - x + y/y^^2 >
k and therefore /1 - x + y/y^^2 < -k for k positive.  Since y^^2 is always
nonnegative, this conditional holds trivially (always) provided that x > 1 +
y.   Since x and y could be selected with exchanged physical roles
(uncertainties in momentum and position respectively, for example), the
condition that x > 1 + y is rather arbitrary and certainly will be fulfilled
for one of the two orders in which x and y are defined.

Even more strikingly, consider the identity 0/1 = 0 of classical
mathematics. Applying the conversion we find 0/1 --> 1 - 0 + 1 = 2 and
deduce 2 = 0, thus giving an unbelievably simple explanation of the Pauli
exclusion principle for fermions.

In answer to Charles Wells
>Can anyone tell me what Ehresmann meant by a "saturated functor" 
>(foncteur saturé) in 1967?

Charles Ehresmann defined a "homomorphism saturated functor" 
already in his lectures in 1962, and it figures in his 1963 paper
"Categories structurees" (Annales ENS), reprinted in

"Charles Ehresmann: Oeuvres completes et Commentees", Part III-1, Amiens
1980, p. 29 

In the "Comments" in this book I have given English translations in more
modern terms of the main categorical definitions and results of Charles,
which, up to the seventies, were often written in a non-usual style, very
difficult to decipher to-day (and even at that moment for most readers,
which explains they were not as widely known as they should have been!)
In particular in the Note 29-2 (p. 348-9 of this book) I have translated
the definition in more modern terms:

A "homomorphism saturated functor" p: H -> C is a faithful amnestic functor
which creates isomorphisms; amnestic means that an isomorphism mapped on an
identity is an identity. Thus H is a concrete category over C, such that
the restriction of p to the groupoid of isomorphisms of H is a discrete
op-fibration.

(there are more information in this Note).

The Dutch film "Antonia" written and directed by Marleen Gorris won
the 1996 Oscar for best foreign language film. There's a scene in
which the 20-year-old granddaughter of the title character is at a
blackboard with a lot of exact sequences. She says (quoting the
English subtitles):

  We will assume that the singular chain complex of the empty set
  equals zero. With theorem 5.8 this implies that the nth homology
  group is the same as the nth relative homology group if we take the
  subspace as the empty set. New we can construct a functor from the
  category....from the category Top to the category of chain 
  complexes. Define the functor  S*  as follows: S*  sends the ordered
  pair  <X,A>  to the singular chain complex of the space  X  divided 
  by the complex of  A.

Is this the first commercial film with categories and functors? (It's
not the first with homological algebra: in 1980 "It's My Turn" opened
with its lead at a blackboard proving the snake lemma.)

It should be noted that the categories and functors in "Antonia" turn
out to be foreplay: the speaker makes eye contact with a guy in her
audience and the next scene instantly transports them from the
classroom to the bedroom.

HEADLINE: Dome useless, says Duke
BYLINE: Dominic Kennedy
BODY:

A smiling Duke of Edinburgh yesterday sabotaged the Pounds 2 million
campaign to save the Millennium Dome by suggesting the attraction was
a useless waste of money.

As the Dome opened an advertising campaign with the slogan "You've got
a mind of your own, take it to the Dome", the Duke decided it was an
apt time to deliver his own verdict. As he opened a new Pounds
56 million Centre for Mathematical Studies at Cambridge University, of
which he is Chancellor, he did a quick calculation. "This is", he said
as he unveiled a commemorative plaque, "a lot less expensive than the
Dome."

The audience laughed so heartily that, warming to his theme, the Duke
added: "And I think it's going to be a great deal more useful."

From: Osher Doctorow osher@ix.netcom.com, Friday July 14, 2000, 8:47AM

Dear Colleagues:

Dr. S. J. Vickers has found two typographical errors in my July 12 =
contribution which might well lead someone to conclude that an erroneous =
one-sided operation on an inequality had been made.  The statement =
"....so the converted form reads: (1 - x + y)y^^2 =3D -/1 - x + y/y^^2 > =
k," shoud have a second constant k1 or k2 (it is arbitrary which =
notation is used) replacing k.  I used the same k by a typographical =
error and also because I had skipped an intermediate step and in my =
haste used the same constant k from before.  The intermediate step was =
merely to consider what happens to xy when the conversion of y/x to 1 - =
x + y is made.   Then xy converts to (1 - x + y)y^^2 =3D -/1 - x + =
y/y^^2 in the case when 1 - x + y < 0, and this is obviously =
nonpositive, so -/1 - x + y/y^^2 < k2 with k2 =3D 0 for example.  For 1 =
- x + y > 0, we have xy converting to /1 - x + y/y^^2 which is =
nonnegative and therefore /1 - x + y/y^^2 > =3D k2 with k2 =3D 0 again.  =


Vickers'  criticism turned out to be very fortunate, not only for =
clarifying the typographical error and avoiding the wrong conclusion =
that I operated on only one side of an inequality when converting xy to =
the other form, but also in my developing a detailed argument concerning =
when the conversion from y/x to 1 - x + y becomes an actual function.   =
This occurs, for example, when y/x is a reduced proper or improper =
fraction in the sense that numerator and denominator have no common =
primes, in which case the unique factorization into primes and =
consideration of the three cases y/x > 1 and y/x < 1 and y/x =3D 1 leads =
to the conclusion that the conversion is a function.  Thus, on the =
reduced rationals, we have a function.  This is not a bad set to work =
with mathematically, and certainly provides a nontrivial case where the =
conversion is a function and is accurate.

I hope that S. J. Vickers will continue to contribute to further =
discussion in this thread because of his important contributions, =
provided of course that he continues to emphasize the correction of =
errors and ways of further applying the conversions.  If somebody finds =
any further errors in my future writings, please give me the benefit of =
considering the possibility that I made a typographical error.

I have just come from the meeting above, which was truly excellent, and
led to a rich and valuable exchange of exciting new mathematics. It gives
me great pleasure to express publicly my gratitute to Aurelio Carboni,
Pino Rosolini,and Bob Walters for setting up and arranging, as the
Organizing Committee, this international meeting, with all the manifold
accompanying logistical problems.

I must say that I found the lack of suitable blackboards an annoying if
minor issue, since I am unused to preparing overhead transparencies, and
was told two minutes before my talk that those I had prepared the night
before were scarcely readable, in having too many lines to the page. In my
disappointment and irritation , I used language stronger than I would have
wished in criticising the lack of the usual communication-tools; I said
"disgraceful" where "unfortunate" would have corresponded better to the
situation. Thus I gave unintended offence to my three dear friends of the
Organizing Committee. I now offer them my public apologies, and seek their
pardon .

Max Kelly.

A list member claims in a private communication to me that 3 things are =
wrong with the x/y to 1 - x + y conversion. His first claim is that "it =
does not ring true" that I meant to type k1 or k2. This criticism is =
outside mathematics and has no meaning either there or in science.

His second claim is that xy =3D (x/y)y^^2 works one way and (x/y)^^2 =
(y^^3)/x works another way in the conversion and that the conversion of =
/ but not other operations is anyway of questionable validity. =
Concerning the second part, the claim is meaningless. Since x/y is the =
main "animal" in BCP and in Goguen/Product logic implication and both =
have the form x/y, there is nothing to prevent me from comparing x/y =
with 1 - x + y in order to compare BCP and Goguen/Product logic =
implications with LBP and Lukaciewicz Logic. Concerning the first part, =
we can define a conversion C_n which converts xy as a product of =
(x/y)^^n g(x,y) where g(x,y) is a rational expression in powers of y =
and/or x no part of which contains (x/y)^^m as a factor for 1 < =3D m < =
=3D n and m, n are integers > =3D 1. C_n (C subscript n) for n =3D 1 =
gives exactly my conversion, and the critic's objection case involves =
C_2 which conversion is not being considered.

The third argument is that the conversion restricted to x/y for x, y =
coprime integers is alarming (because) continuity is lost (that is to =
say, I should mention, that the rationals are not continuous while the =
reals are) and because it is unclear how to apply the conversion to =
expressions of the form xy (is xy to be the product of two coprime =
integers or what?). This is really two objections except for the word =
"alarming" which is not a word in mathematics or science. The first =
objection, concerning continuity, implicitly assumes that the conversion =
is required to be continuous. Although I used the conversion earlier to =
attempt to convert xy in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) xy > =
k, which perhaps should "ideally" involve all real xy, if the critic =
admits that the conversion works for rational x and y or even integer x =
and y, then xy restricted to either rational or integer x and y converts =
to two different inequalities depending on whether 1 - x + y < 0 or 1 - =
x + y > 0 (respectively x > 1 + y or x < 1 + y), so the converted form =
of xy does not obey the HUP, and therefore continuity is not even =
required to show what I had attempted to show about the HUP. The second =
objection, concerning whether xy is restricted to the product of two =
coprime integers, is rather redundant considering the above.

Yours truly,

Osher Doctorow=20

At the Como meeting last week, I asked various people a question 
which I view as having foundational significance: is there a 
setting in which one can iterate the presheaf construction (as 
free cocompletion) without ever having to use the word "small" 
or worry about size? 

Here is a more precise formulation of what I am after. 
I want an example of a compact closed bicategory B [think: 
bicategory of profunctors] with the following very strong 
property: the inclusion 

             i: Ladj(B) --> B, 

of the bicategory of left adjoints in B, has a right biadjoint p 
such that, calling y: 1 --> pi the unit and e: ip -|-> 1 the counit, 
the isomorphisms which fill in the triangles 
               iy               yp
             i --> ipi        p --> pip
               \    |           \    |    
                 \  | ei          \  | pe
                   \|               \|     
                    i                p 

furnish the unit and counit, respectively, of adjunctions iy --| ei 
in B and pe --| yp in Ladj(B).  (These structures should also be 
compatible with the symmetric monoidal bicategory structures on 
B and Ladj(B).)  By exploiting compact closure, it's easy to see 
that p(b) is equivalent to an exponential (p1)^(b^op) in Ladj(B), 
where b^op denotes the dual of b in the sense of compact closure. 
So the unit y: 1 --> pi takes the yoneda-like form b --> v^(b^op); 
the axioms imply it is the fully faithful unit of a KZ-monad. 

The reactions I got were varied and interesting. As filtered through 
me, here are some (abbreviated) responses: 
 
(1) "No, I don't think there are any examples except the obvious 
     locally posetal ones." 
(2) "The notion looks essentially algebraic, so I see no obstacle 
     in principle to producing examples; it should even be easy for 
     the right (2-categorically minded) people." 
(3) [From experts in domain theory] "Good question! Hmmmmmmmm....."  
(4) "It seems to me there is no reason in the world why examples 
     should not exist, but the techniques developed for dealing 
     with things like modest sets are probably not sufficient for 
     dealing with your question, and may be misleading here." 

The various responses suggest *to me* that the question may be 
quite interesting and quite hard. 

My own sense, based on playing around with the axioms on a purely 
formal level, is that there is probably no inconsistency in the sense 
that any two 2-cells with common source and target are provably equal. 
My only vague idea on producing an example would be to proceed as Church 
and Rosser did in the old days: work purely syntactically, and consider 
the possibility of strong normalization for terms. Perhaps one could 
then show that the term model is not locally posetal.

ABSTRACT:

Action calculi, which have a graphical presentation, were introduced
to develop a theory shared among different calculi for interactive
systems.  The pi-calculus, the lambda-calculus, Petri nets, the
Ambient calculus and others may all be represented as action calculi.
This paper develops a part of the shared theory.

A recent paper by two of the authors was concerned with the notion of
<i>reactive system</i>, essentially a category of process contexts
whose behaviour is presented as a reduction relation. It was shown
that one can, for any reactive system, uniformly derive a labelled
transition system whose associated behavioural equivalence relations
(e.g., trace equivalence or bisimilarity) will be congruential, under
the condition that certain <i>relative pushouts</i> exist in the
reactive system.  In the present paper we treat <i>closed, shallow</i>
action calculi (those with no free names and no nested actions) as a
generic application of these results.  We define a category of action
graphs and embeddings, closely linked to a category of contexts which
forms a reactive system.  This connection is of independent interest;
it also serves our present purpose, as it enables us to demonstrate
that appropriate relative pushouts exist.

Complemented by work to be reported elsewhere, this demonstration
yields labelled transition systems with behavioural congruences for a
substantial class of action calculi.  We regard this work as a step
towards comparable results for the full class.

The following is suggested by Max Kelly's comments and some discussions at
Como.

We have to be prepared for the worst scenario, that blackboard facilities
will get worse, and it may even get to a stage where conference
administrators wonder why mathematicians are not using powerpoint and
computer presentations like everyone else!

People should be aware that Latex facilities for slides are good: just use
\documentclass{slides} \begin{document} \raggedright \begin{slide}
......\end{slide} etc. A  colleague here also got splendid results using
the colour package (I need to investigate this!).

I also like to use in the preamble
\parindent=0pt
\parskip=1ex

and to use almost pidgin English, so that  the impact is visual, with as
few words as possible.

What is not so clear is how to use say animated  gif files in such a
presentation. For this I have used a browser presentation using html files,
and converting tex into html using tth

http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/

I hope this helps people. We could then ask conference centres to provide
projection facilities, if these are a requirement of users.

I disagree.  I think we should continue to protest the lack of
blackboards.  I have used transparencies and I have even used tex to
prepare them.  But I don't like it and I don't think it makes good talks
and I don't see why we should acquiesce.

                                (Q, <=)


- This is a problem from Arbib's book on category theory

- P is a pre-order

- (P/E) and Q are posets

- N and f are order-preserving functions from a pre-order to a poset.

- g is a order-preserving function between posets P/E and G, i.e.
     a poset homomorphism, that is UNIQUE.

- Question 1: we are building category where the objects are the
               collection of order-preserving functions from P to
               posets and
               morphisms are order-preserving functions between posets
               that make a diagram like the following commute, i.e.

                      h.g = f

               Is the above statement true?


                    h
    (P, <=) ---------------------> (R, <=)
     \                           |

         \                       |
           \                     |
             \                   |
               \                 |  g
                 \               |
          f        \             |
                     \           |
                       \         |
                         \       |
                           \     |
                             \   |
                               \ v
                                (Q, <=)



- Question 2: if indeed this forms a category, then (P/E, N) is an
                 initial object in this category. True??


- Question 3: the whole notion introduced by this Arbib problem is
                  that of "free" poset, i.e. something
                  very akin to a free algebra, free group, etc.
                  I.e. the same kind of categoric construct. Yes????




Thank you,

Bill Halchin

  Bob: I've added a description of his dissertation, so use this if
  you haven't already sent the other out.



I thought it might be interesting to find out about Osher Doctorow.
Something called "Nupedia" lists him as one of its "very distinguished
and active scholars, and all-around interesting people" to be found
among its Editors and Peer Reviewers. Nupedia tells us:
                                            
  Osher Doctorow (PR) -- Ph.D. (1982 UCLA).  Consultant in mathematics
  and physics mostly since 1973, Doctorow Consultants, Culver City,
  California.  M.A.  Mathematics (USC 1969), M.A. Anthropology
  (University of London 1961). Over 150 papers presented and
  publications, about 40 of which abstracted at Instititute for Logic
  at University of Vienna on the internet, plus (in addition to the
  150 or so above) about 40 book reviews on math and physics mostly,
  at Amazon.com. Taught university mathematics five years; Staff
  Research Assistant (statistics) UCLA six years; Mathematician U.S.
  Defense Department 2-1/4 years in artificial satellites (Sustained
  Superior Performance Award in Mathematics 1984); Statistician at
  private research institute one year; High School/Middle school
  mathematics teacher two years.  Member Armed Forces Communications
  and Electronics Association (AFCEA), UCLA Alumni Association
  (lifetime). Married 30+ years to Dr. Marleen Josie Doctorow
  (psychologist), one son, Eric.
   

PsycINFO tells us:

  Author
    Doctorow, Osher.
  Institution
    U California, Los Angeles.
  Title
    Modeling cognitive growth by the linear system of linked differential
    equations (LSDE).

Following the Nupedia lead we find that the "Abstract Service for
Mathematical Logic" of the Institute for Logic at the University of
Vienna lists abstracts for 45 journal publications for Doctorow,
Osher. The journals in question turn out to be:

I agree with Mike Barr. I think there is a specific reason for using
blackboards in math talks: Where most disciplines use graphics and texts to
present data and conclusions, mathematicians often write to convey a line
of reasoning as it develops. When I talk about math I often put formulas or
diagrams on the board, and change them as I go. 

Slides and powerpoint can handle those changes in various ways, but none
are as flexible or as graceful as writing on a board.

Below you will find the final schedule for the Special Session on "Applied
Categorical Structures" at the up-coming AMS Meeting in Toronto, Sept. 23&24.
There will be a Welcome Party on Friday evening (Sept. 22) - details to be
communicated in early September. Note specifically that the program on Sunday
afternoon continues until 5 pm rather than until 4pm as previously announced.

For comprehensive and continually updated meeting and program information,
including accommodation in Toronto, see

http://www.ams.org/meetings/

Hotel accomodation in Toronto during the month of September can be very tight.
In fact, the deadlines for making bookings in the two AMS-recommended hotels in
Toronto are approaching rapidly. These are:

"Courtyard by Marriott", 475 Yonge St., (416) 924-0611, $182 (Can.) for single
or double by
August 1;
"Days Inn", 30 Carlton St., (416) 977-6655 or (800) 325-2525, $139 (Can.) for
single or double by August 23.

As an alternative to the Days Inn (same price or lower, 15 min walk to
conference site) you may want to try the following smaller downtown hotel,
which we have used for vistors in the past:
Howard Johnson Inn, 89 Avenue Road, (416) 964-1220 or (800) 446 4656.

We look forward to seeing you in Toronto.

[NOTE FROM MODERATOR: This message should be the last of the discussion on
this issue, regards to all, Bob Rosebrugh]


The posts from Mike and Colin prompt me to go on record.

In my talk at Como I did not use projectors.

I used the two blackboards that were provided by the organizers.

Since Ladj(Span) is essentially Set, we would need, for every set b, 
a set pb such that for every a, the large category of spans a -|-> b 
is equivalent to the small discrete category of functions a --> pb. 
This doesn't work. 

[Just to avoid a possible misunderstanding: if B is a bicategory, then 
by Ladj(B) I mean the locally full subbicategory of B with the same 
objects as B and whose 1-cells are left adjoints in B. Katis and Walters 
have a paper which uses the same notation Ladj(B) for something else.]

	Last week's CT 2000 meeting in Como, Italy had two quite notable
features, which augur well for the future of category theory:

- the significant number of young people who are actively learning
and developing category theory and who presented their new results;

- the unusual number of senior researchers in other fields whose essential
use of category theory was demonstrated in their interesting lectures.

Congratulations to the organizers, as well as to the scientific committee,
and thanks for their hard work which successfully brought us all together.

In an earlier posting I showed how to define co-inductively the closed
interval, in particular I showed that its elements are named by 
sequences of  0s  and  1s  with the usual binary-expansion equivalence
relation. There is a well-known computational problem with this 
approach, already in the definition of the midpoint operation: at what
point can you determine the first digit of the midpoint of .0000...  
and  .1111...? 

At the Como meeting I learned from Andrej Bauer about a  better
approach. Take the elements of  [-1,1]  to be named by infinite
sequences of _signed_ binary digits, that is -1, 0, +1.

[Just to confuse matters, Scedrov and I once used signed _ternary_ 
digits (n Cats and Allegators for the "Freyd curve"). The signed binary
expansions  .+1 -1  and  .0 +1  describe the same number, to wit, 1/4.]

Using signed binary expansions one can compute midpoints with a little
3-state machine that takes as input the sequence of pairs of signed 
binary digits of the given numbers  x  and  y, and produces as output
a sequence of signed binary digits for the midpoint  x|y. (There may,
indeed, be momentary delays in the output, but there will not be an
indefinite delay -- indeed, the number of output digits will never be
more than one less than the number of pairs of input digits).

The challenge is to revise the co-induction so that it is this better 
version that emerges.

In the previous version I worked in the category of posets with
_distinct_ top and bottom, that is, those posets for which

                      not[(B = x) and (x = T)].

In the revised version I'll strengthen the condition by working in the
category of posets with _separated_ top and bottom:

                         [(B < x) or (x < T)].

(The conditions are equivalent in the presence of De Morgan's law. In
a topos the top and bottom of omega are always distinct but they are
separated only when De Morgan's law is satisfied throughout.)

In the previous setting I defined what I'll now call the _thin_ 
version of the ordered-wedge of  X  and  Y, to wit, the set of pairs,
<x,y>  satisfying the condition:

                          (x = T) or (B = y).

The _thick_ version is the set of pairs, <x,y>  satisfying the two 
weaker conditions:
                          (x < T) => (B = y)
                          (B < y) => (x = T)

(each of which is classically equivalent to the single condition used 
in the thin version).

Easy exercise: if top and bottom are separated in  X  and  Y, then 
they are separated in the thick version of the ordered-wedge  XvY.
(Indeed, it's enough for top and bottom to be separated in just one of
X  and  Y . No, it is not enough to assume just that they are distinct
in each.)

A map  X -> XvX  is thus given by a pair  d,u: X -> X  such that for
all  x:
                         (dx < T) => (B = ux)
                         (B < ux) => (dx = T)

The final coalgebra for  XvX  is still the closed interval, but now in 
the better computational sense. Let me explain.

Given an arbitrary coalgebra  d,u : X -> X, I need to describe a 
coalgebra homomorphism  f: X -> I. where  I  is the set of equivalence
types of infinite sequences of signed binary digits.

The first step is to work not with elements of  X  but elements of 
XvX. Consider a machine that given  <x,y>:XvX  asks in parallel the
questions:
                         "B < y?"
                         "B < ux  and  dy < T?"
                         "x < T?"

Exercise: If the top and bottom of  X  are separated and  d,u 
describe a map to the thick ordered-wedge  XvX, then at least one of
these questions has a positive answer.

Given  z:X  obtain a sequence of signed binary digits by starting with
the pair  <x,y> = <dz,uz>  and iterating the  non-deterministic 
procedure:

  If  B < y               
    then emit  +1  as output and replace  <x,y>  with  <dy,uy>;
  If  B < ux  and  dy < T  
    then emit   0  as output and replace  <x,y>  with  <ux,dy>;
  If  x < B      
    then emit  -1  as output and replace  <x,y>  with  <dx,ux>.

Not-so-easy exercises: regardless of the non-determinism, the element 
fz:[-1,+1]  named by the resulting sequence is determined. Moreover,
f(uz) = u(fz)  and  f(dz) = df(z).


PS. There is some geometry behind this stuff. Let me here mention just
this: given a pair  <x,y>  in  XvX  map it into the four-fold 
ordered-wedge  XvXvXvX. Think of each of the four copies of  X  as one
"quarter" of the whole. If  B < y  then the point lies inside the "top
half" (the 3rd and 4th quarters). If  B < ux  and  dy < T  then the 
point lies inside the "middle half" (the 2nd and 3rd quarters). If 
x < B  then the  point lies inside the bottom half" (the 1st and 2nd
quarters). Clearly any point is inside at least one of these three 
halves. The output-digit registers which of the three halves is moved
to and the corresponding pair-replacement effects that move.


PPS. On 22 Dec I gave a Dedekind-cut proof that the interval  [0,1]  
constructed in the standard fashion from (unsigned) binary sequences 
is the final coalgebra for the functor that sends  X  (with distinct 
top and bottom) to the thin version of  XvX. That proof should be 
replaced. First note that the midpoint-algebra homomorphism from  [0,1]
to  [-1,1]  can be effected simply by replacing each  0  with  -1  and
keeping each  1  as  +1. Given  d,u:X -> X  such that for all  x  it is
the case that either  dx = T  or  ux = B , consider a machine that upon
given  x:X  asks in parallel the questions  "dx = T?"  and  "ux = B?".
 
 If  dx = T  then emit  +1  as output and replace  x  with  ux, 
 If  ux = B  then emit  -1  as output and replace  x  with  dx. 

Given  x:X  one may iterate this (non-deterministic) procedure to
obtain a sequence of  +1s  and  -1s. Pretty-easy exercises: regardless
of the non-determinism, the element  fx:[-1,+1]  named by the
resulting sequence is determined; f(ux) = u(fx); f(dx) = df(x).
