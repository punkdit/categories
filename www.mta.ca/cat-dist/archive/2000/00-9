  Mike Barr asked:

    Suppose  X  is an abelian category and  T:X --> Ab  is a left- 
    exact functor. Say an object  E  is  T-effaceable if for every 
    exact sequence  0 --> E --> B --> A --> 0, the induced  TB --> TA  
    is surjective. Now suppose that  0 --> E' --> E --> E'' --> 0  is 
    an exact sequence in which  E  and  E' are  T-effaceable. Does it 
    follow that  E'' is?

  (Well, actually he asked the dual question. But they're equivalent.)

  The answer is no.

  Suppose we have an abelian category with a map  x:E --> E  where

     1)  E is injective;
     2)  the image of  x  is not injective; and
     3)  x  is not a zero-divisor in the ring of endomorphisms of E.

  Let  E'  denote the kernel of  x, E'' the image and  F  the 
cokernel. Let  T  be the representable functor  (F,-).

In order of difficulty:

   E  is  T-effaceable because being condition 1 says that it's 
T-effaceable for any old  T.

   E'' is not  T-effaceable because if the exact sequence
0 --> E'' --> E --> F --> 0  were to be carried into an exact sequence
0 --> (F,E'') --> (F,E) --> (F,F) --> 0  then the identity element in
(F,F)  would have a pre-image and the  0 --> E'' --> E --> F --> 0  
would split, forcing  E'' to be injective (violating condition 2).

   E' is  T-effaceable because given  0 --> E' --> B --> A --> 0  
exact we show that  0 --> (F,E') --> (F,B) --> (F,A) --> 0  exact by 
showing that any  F --> A  has a pre-image in  (F,B); we do that by 
first constructing the exact diagram (add your own downwards 
arrowheads):
                      0 --> E'--> C --> F --> 0     

                           1|     |     |

                      0 --> E'--> B --> A --> 0  

by taking the right-hand square as a pullback; we need to show that
the top sequence splits; construct:

                      0 --> E'--> C --> F --> 0     

                           1|     |     |

                      0 --> E'--> E --> E''--> 0     

by using the injectivity of  E  to obtain the middle vertical and
the exactness of the rows to obtain the right-hand vertical; note
         x
that  E --> E --> F --> E'' --> E  is necessarily the zero-map, 
hence  E --> F --> E'' --> E  is a zero-divisor for  x, and condition
3 together with the epiness of  E --> F  and the mononess of  E'' -> E
forces  F --> E'' to be the zero-map; that forces  C --> E --> E''
to be the zero-map; and that says that  C --> E  can be factored 
through  E' --> E; but that implies that  E' --> C  is a split mono;
so  C --> F  is a split epi.

   How do we know that the three numbered conditions can be met? 
There must be an easier way, but the one that occurs to me is to use
the category Joel Cohen named in his book the Freyd Category (named 
not after me, he says, but my daughter). It's the abelian category in
which the stable-homotopy category of finite complexes appears as
the full subcategory of injective-projectives.  Take  E  to be 
the sphere. Its ring of endomorphisms is the ring of integers and
we can take  x = 2.  Using that the endomorphisms form a connected
ring (no non-trivial idempotents) we know that  x  is not epi (else
it would be a split epi) and its image, being a proper non-trivial
subobject, can't be injective.

  (If you try for a dual example by replacing "injective" with
"projective", avoid the temptation of taking  E  to be free -- can't
work.)

  When Mike and I started, category theory was classified (by MR and 
just about everybody) as homological algebra. Mike was right, in fact,
when he said, "I thought this would be a simple application of the
snake lemma", albeit in the other direction. Assuming that  T  could
be taken as a functor of the form  (F,-)  a little homological algebra
says that what's needed is an object  E'  where  Ext(F,E')  is trivial
but  Ext^2(F,E')  is not. I thought it might be best -- since category
theory is no longer a subset of homological algebra -- to get rid of
the Exts.

Dear Category Theorist:

This is the final announcement for the Special Session on "Applied
Categorical Structures" at the up-coming AMS Meeting in Toronto, Sept. 23&24.
The Session will be held in Room 2173 of the Medical Sciences Building on the
downtown campus  of the University of Toronto. It will start on Saturday at 9am
and finish on Sunday at 5pm.

For comprehensive and continually updated meeting and program information,
including accommodation in Toronto, see

http://www.ams.org/meetings/

For the the program of the Session, see also the end of this message. There has
been one change since Andre' Joyal is not able to attend, due to sudden
unavoidable circumstances.

There will be a WELCOME PARTY on Friday, September 22, starting at 7pm, for
participants of the Session. With funds provided by York University we are
pleased to be able to invite you and your spouse/friend to a complimentary
buffet dinner (open till 10pm) in the Thai restaurant

"Sawaddee" at 150 Avenue Road, Toronto, tel. (416) 921 9198.

The restaurant is located at the north-west corner of the intersection of
Avenue Road with Davenport, which is 7 (very short) blocks north of Bloor St.
It's about a 15-minute walk from the UofT-campus, and less than 5 minutes from
the Howard Johnson Inn which we mentioned in our previous message. The walk
from the Days Inn on Carlton St would be about 30 minutes; a reasonable
alternative to walking all the way or taking a short taxi ride would be walking
westbound from the hotel on Carlton and College to Bay Street and taking the
"Bay" bus no.6 north and to get off right at the intersection Avenue
Rd/Davenport (subway token or exact fare $2 required). If coming by car to the
restaurant, your best bet would be to search for spots on the streets in the
area north west of the restaurant, success not guaranteed.

In order for us to know the approximate number of participants, PLEASE LET US
KNOW BY FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, WHETHER YOU'LL BE COMING TO THE WELCOME PARTY, by
e-mailing tholen@mathstat.yorku.ca (see form below).

We look forward to seeing you in Toronto.

Joan Wick Pelletier
Walter Tholen

I'm interested in proofs of or counterexamples for
the following conjectures:

Conjecture 1:
Any Set-endofunctor that preserves
kernels (i.e. pullbacks of a mapping with itself)
preserves pullbacks.

Conjecture 2:
Any Set-endofunctor that preserves
kernels *and inverse images* (i.e. pullbacks
where one of the mapping is injective)
preserves pullbacks.

Conjecture 3:
Same as Conj. 2 with *and inverse images*
replaced by *and equalizers*.

Conjecture 4:
Same as Conj. 1-3, but concerning *weak*
preservation.

Conjectur 5:
Same as 1-4, but for Set-endofunctors
that are subfunctors of a pullback
preserving functor.

I tried to prove these facts in several ways
but was not able to do it or to find a
counterexample (the answer to this questions
is of some relevance for my work on coalgebras)
... and it looks quite easy, doesn't it?

Can somebody help me in this?

Thank you very much in advance

Tobias Schroeder asks:


    Conjecture 1:
    Any Set-endofunctor that preserves kernel pairs
    [He called them "kernels"]
    preserves pullbacks.

Counterexample: the functor that sends the empty set to the empty set
and everything else to a fixed one-element set. (Note that this is
also a counterexample for the conjecture-5 modification.)


    Conjecture 2:
    Any Set-endofunctor that preserves n
    kernel pairs *and inverse images* (i.e. pullbacks
    where one of the mapping is injective)
    preserves pullbacks.

Proof: Given such a functor, T:A --> B, where  A  and  B  are 
sufficiently nice categories, lift it to  T:A --> B/T1  to obtain a
functor that not only preserves kernel-pairs and inverse images but
the terminator. It suffices to prove that this lifted  T  preserves
pullbacks (using the fact that the forgetful functor  B/T1 --> B 
preserves pullbacks). hence it suffices to consider the conjecture
assuming that the functor preserves also the terminator. A well-known
argument then reduces the question to the preservation of binary 
products. (One may construct equalizers using inverse images and
products and from there to arbitrary pullbacks is ancient. See 1.43 in
Cats and Allegators.) What we will use is that the functor preserves 
inverse images and iterated products. Given sets  X  and  Y  we know 
that the product diagram:

             (X+Y)x(X+Y)

                /   \         [add your own downwards arrowheads]

             X+Y     X+Y

is carried to a product diagram

           T((X+Y)x(X+Y))

                /   \  

           T(X+Y)   T(X+Y).

Using three inverse-image diagrams obtain:

                XxY

               /   \

           Xx(X+Y) (X+Y)xY

           /   \   /   \

         X  (X+Y)x(X+Y)  Y

           \   /   \   /       

             X+Y     X+Y

Now apply  T:

              T(XxY)

              /     \

       T(Xx(X+Y)) T((X+Y)xY)

         /     \   /     \

       TX  T((X+Y)x(X+Y)) TY

         \     /   \     /       

          T(X+Y)  T(X+Y)

As already observed, the very bottom  / \  is a product diagram. Each
rombus is an inverse-image pullback, hence preserved. Thus the top
 / \
/   \  a product diagram.



    Conjecture 3:
    Same as Conj. 2 with *and inverse images*
    replaced by *and equalizers*.

Inverse images of regular subobjects (that is, those that appear as
equalizers) are regular: the equalizer of  x,y  under a map  f  is the
equalizer of  xf,yf.  Hence if every subobject is regular than
preservation of equalizers implies preservation of inverse images.

			  First Announcement

              Foundations of Wide Area Network Programming
              ============================================
 
       13th International School for Computer Science Researchers
                    Lipari Island, July 1-14, 2001


 The 13th School for Computer Science Researchers addresses Ph.D. 
 students and young researchers who want to get exposed to the
 forefront of research activity in the field of Wide Area Network
 Programming, with particular reference to the future of the World
 Wide Web and to issues of distributed architectures, software
 engineering, object oriented design, security, mobility,
 coordination, collaborative work and retrieval/handling of
 semistructured data.

 The school will be held in the beautiful surroundings of the island
 of Lipari. Participants will be arranged in a comfortable hotel at
 very special rates. The conference room (in the same hotel) is air
 conditioned and equipped with all conference materials. Special areas
 are reserved to students for the afternoon coursework and study. A
 proficiency final exam at the end of each chosen course is mandatory
 for students. A social tour to Stromboli with spectacular vulcano
 fireworks will be held on Sunday, July 8.

 The official language is English.

 The island of Lipari can be easily reached from Milazzo, Palermo,
 Naples, Messina and Reggio Calabria by ferry or hydrofoil (50 minutes
 from Milazzo). The organization provides a round-trip bus from
 Catania airport (the third most important airport in Italy) to
 Milazzo hydrofoil terminal and viceversa.

From: Osher Doctorow, Ph.D. osher@ix.netcom.com, Monday Sept. 11, 2000,

Consider the fixed point g(x,y) = (x,y) for g(x,y) = (x-->y, (x-->y)^)
where x-->y is 1 - x + y and its real conjugate, labeled (x-->y)^, is 1 +
x - y.   This is equivalent to 1 - x + y = x, 1 - y + x = y, and subtracting
the second equation from the first results in -x + y + y - x = x - y or
3(y - x) = 0 so y = x and substituting for either x or y in the first or
second equation yields the unique solution x = 1, y = 1, so the fixed point
is (1, 1), and since x-->y = x and y-->x = y, we also have x-->y = 1 and
y-->x = 1.   It turns out that even if the problem had been g(x,y) = (y,x)
for the above g, the same fixed point would have been obtained.

This is remarkable for those interested in fixed points.   Fixed points have
turned out to be of considerable importance across categories, and similarly
for symmetry groups and invariance properties, both in mathematics and
physics.  From the above paragraph, the multiplicative unit of the category
has turned out to be its unique fixed point.  Also it suggests that
categories for which the multiplicative unit is very important are those in
which x-->y = 1 - x + y plays an important role.  This holds for at least
two categories, which I will refer to for short as probabilities and (fuzzy)
multivalued logic - especially Product/Goguen logic and Lukaciewicz logic,
although both are related to Godel logic.  The multiplicative unit is
important in probability because probabilities by definition are between 0
and 1 - their multiplicative unit is also their maximum.   In (fuzzy)
multivalued logics, the unit 1 is similarly an extreme value, although it is
usually considered to be the "trivial" case of either tautology or
contradiction (usually tautology).  This would at least preserve the
intuitive idea of tautology expressing "complete logical truth", however
trivial we may consider that to be.

The above results also suggest that a generalization of fixed point results
to the general case where x-->y and/or y-->x = 1 might be quite useful, and
this is precisely what logic-based probability (LBP) has found to be the
case (recall my previous contributions to categories@mta.ca).

There is an interesting application to history that I might cite as an
amusing aside.   History is usually taught in terms of stories - the story
of a war, a civilization, an era, etc.  The above results would suggest, if
they are applicable to history, that it is best to teach history as the
study of rare discrete events and how they causally influence each other.
For example, what caused a war, what ended a war, or in different language,
why did the war occur, why did the war end, etc.  The discrete events would
correspond to fixed points, and we would be especially interested in them
when they are repeated in history - the repetition would correspond to fixed
points or invariance in time or symmetry in time.  Then history would become
the study of why errors repeat rather than merely the study of what
happened, where it happened, who it happened to, how it happened, etc.  I
find this somewhat amusing because of arguments that one can get into when
discussing matters with the more detail-obsessed historians to whom any
suggestion of causation or relationships across categories results sometimes
in remarkable responses.

Has anybody ever proved the following result?

In the category of posets the initial algebra with the following
operations:


1- a constant 0

2- an inflationary successor s :  x \le sx

3- sups of omega-Chains


is the least non-denumerable ordinal  Omega.


This seems to be a pretty natural question to ask, so it must have been
done before.

The following question looks so natural that somebody's
bound to have looked into it:

Does the functor

Cat^op ---> CAT

A  |-->   [A,Set]

reflect isomorphisms (more generally: limits)?

related questions (i.e. ones that would solve the problem or
at least help solving it) are

-- Are epimorphisms in Cat those functors F:A-->B for which
   F[A] generates B by composites and inverses of isomorphisms (in B)?
-- is the source of all covariant hom-functors an extremal mono-source
   in CAT?


The answers are probably in the literature - but where?

Thanks a lot,

Lutz Schroeder

The question is not very well posed: since Cat and CAT are 2-categories,
one ought to be asking about whether it reflects equivalences. For this,
the answer is negative (and well known): a functor A --> B induces an
equivalence [B,Set] --> [A,Set] iff it induces an equivalence between the
idempotent-completions of A and B. So the inclusion of any non-idempotent-
complete category in its idempotent-completion provides a counterexample.

However, if you insist on asking about isomorphisms rather than 
equivalences, the answer is yes. It's easy to see that if F: A --> B
fails to be surjective (resp. injective) on objects then the induced
functor [F,Set] fails to be injective (resp. surjective); so if [F,Set]
is an isomorphism then F must be bijective on objects, and this combined
with inducing an equivalence of idempotent-completions is enough to make it
an isomorphism.

But this is not a very meaningful result. Provided you assume a sufficiently
powerful form of the axiom of choice, [A,Set] and {B,Set] will be isomorphic
whenever they are equivalent (since each has a proper class of objects in
each isomorphism class, except for the initial object which is unique in
its isomorphism class). The isomorphism will not, of course, be induced by
a functor from A to B; but it will be naturally isomorphic to a functor that
is (at least provided B is idempotent-complete).

In response to the note by Eduardo Dubuc, I would like to urge the workers
in the field of SDG who use this topos (and it is hardly easy to avoid
doing so!) to name it the "Dubuc topos". I myself have used several other
names for it, such as G (for germ determined) or \tilde(B^op) for the site
of definition, and this includes my papers in the JPPA on Synthetic
Aspects of C-infinity mappings (one with F. Gago), my paper with M. Heggie
in Contemporary Mathematics, and even in our joint paper B-D, Local
concepts, where we called it G. In fact, this is perfectly appropriate and
I always referred to the sources.
 
Therefore, it may thus seem like a strange request, and even more strange
that I agree to this request at this point (assuming that I will ever
write anything again in SDG!), but I understand it perfectly. It is
annoying to see one's work being appropriated by others who, little by
little contribute to the obliteration of  any direct reference (except pro
forma) to the originator of these ideas. This is definitely wrong and has
done damage which may not be too late to repair.
 
I have been a witness to the developments that Eduardo Dubuc  relates in
his note and  I herewith corroborate their authenticity. Moreover, I have
related these very facts to many people, including one of the authors of
the Moerdijk-Reyes team, who blamed the other one for it! I have also said
as much in refereeing papers by the Moerdijk-Reyes team, with copies to
the authors. This is not a fib of someone's imagination, as may be easy to
infer not knowing the facts or the people involved.
 
Something has now triggered it all back, it is unimportant what did it.
What matters is that this sad and obscure aspect of the history of
categories and of our group has never come up into the open. Now that the
author himself has felt the need to do so, I have no problem supporting
him and wishing that at least from now on his work will be given the
credit it deserves.

The least non-denumerable ordinal is usually called omega_1, and even
though the result you are after is not directly stated in the book

    A. Joyal, I. Moerdijk, Algebraic Set Theory, LMS Lect Notes 220,
    Cambridge University Press, 1995,

this book is clearly relevant to your question.  Joyal and Moerdijk,
in a tour de force, construct a number of free algebras for various
kinds of successor operation and "small"-indexed sups, for a quite
general notion of "small" that includes the kind of cardinality
restriction to which you refer.

           GERM DETERMINED IDEALS AND WELL ADAPTED MODELS OF SDG
          
            I write this note because I feel it is time to let know 
explicitly to the category theory community the following situation, and 
to make a request.
            
            In a recent paper on SDG "Super smooth topoi, by H. 
Nishimura" one can read the following: "Therefore we must build our model 
theory of Synthetic Supergeometry not directly after the standard manner 
of Moerdijk & Reyes [1991] [*] but after the manner of Dubuc-Taubin 
[1983]". Now, this "standard manner" of building models was  developed by 
Dubuc  and not by Moerdijk-Reyes. 

(in [1983] I developed also the analytic model, which does not correspond
to an algebraic theory in the Lawvere sense, and can not be done as the
differential models which correspond to C-infinity rings). 

           [*][M-R] "Models of Smooth infinitesimal Analysis", Moerdijk 
and Reyes, Springer Verlag 1991.

            Of course, I understand that when a monograph is available, 
the proper reference is that, and not the original papers. But, phrases 
as the one quoted above are ambiguous, and at fault is not Nishimura.
            
            I shall resume the history of the subject: In a series of 
papers and many lectures given specially in Montreal, Sydney, Oberwolfach  
and elsewhere I created and started the developement of the subject of
models of SDG adapted (or well adapted as I call them) for the applications to 
classical differential geometry.
            
            [1] Sur les Modeles de la Geometrie Differentielle 
Sinthetyque, "Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle" Vol. XX-3 
(1979).
            [2] Schemas C-inf (amplified version of [3], with detailed 
proofs and many examples), "Prepublications de la Universite de Montreal" 
80-81 edited by  G. Reyes (1980).
            [3] C-inf Schemes, "American Journal of Mathematics", John 
Hopkins University, Vol. 103-4 (1981).
            [4] Open Covers and Infinitary Operations in C-inf-rings, 
"Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle" Vol. XXII-3 (1981).
            [5] Archimedian Local C-inf-rings and Models of SDG (with 
Marta Bunge), "Cahiers de Topologie et Geometrie Differentielle" Vol. 
XXVII-3 (1986).
            [6] Germ representability and Local integration of vector
fields in a well adapted model of SDG,  "Journal of Pure and Applied
Algebra" Vol. 64 (1990).
            
            A) I introduced the notion of well adapted models and 
constructed the first ones.

            B) I started a systematic study of C-infinity rings as such. 
Of course, they were already there, but nothing had been done with them. 
I had to state and prove even such simple facts as that the algebraic 
quotient of a C-infinity ring by an R-algebra ideal had a canonical 
structure of C-infinity ring, and was then the quotient in this category. 

             I introduced the notion of Germ Determined Ideal (or ideal 
of local nature), which was, as such, nowhere to be found in the 
literature, and stated and proved their basic properties. 

            This, I think, is the most important concept in the subject. 
It is the basic definition to start to build upon. It is just the right 
concept needed. Among other things, I first proved it contains all 
finitely generated ideals, and defines the largest possible class of 
C-infinity rings consistent with the nullestelentsatz. This means that 
the ring can be seen as the ring of global sections of a C-infinity 
Scheme. The notion of germ determined ideal also determines the right 
notion of C-infinity local ring (notice that I do not say local 
C-infinity ring), that I then developed. I also developed the relative 
C-infinity version of inverting elements universally, and proved that the 
ring of C-infinity functions defined in an open set U inverts universally 
a function which is non-zero exactly on U (every Euclidean open is 
C-infinity  Zariski). Etc, etc, all the basic structure of the C-infinity 
relative version of algebraic geometry.

            Now, [M-R] write "Although this general notion of C-infinity 
ring does not occur as such in classical analysis and differential 
geometry, the main examples do ...  Given the role of these examples of 
C-infinity rings in the classical literature, it is not surprising that 
although the statements of several of the results in this chapter seem 
new, most of their proofs are either known or easily derivable from known 
ones".
            This is, at the least, misleading, and can also be applied to 
many important concepts in mathematics. Of course, when the new concepts 
are introduced, the examples are already there, and the proof of the 
basic properties is easy.  [M-R] ignore the fact that the important thing 
is to identify explicitly the concept, and to identify the right
statements. And this does not come easily. 
            And I repeat, even if C-infinity rings may have been there,
the concept of germ determined ideal was not, and derived concepts and the
statments of their basic essential properties could not even be there.

            C) With this in hand, I introduced the Topos G of sheaves for 
the open covering topology on the dual of the category of C-infinity 
rings presented by a germ determined ideal, and proved all the basic 
important properties, which many times are the correct relative 
C-infinity versions of corresponding properties in algebraic geometry.

            This topos is the best known model in order to do 
applications of SDG to classical differential geometry, and as such, it 
is the most utilized in practice.
            Many early workers in the subject (J. Penon, O. Bruno, F. 
Gago, Yetter, among others) called this topos "The Dubuc Topos". Even 
Moerdijk and Reyes did so in some preprints, although they changed this 
in the published version. 

            Now, [M-R] write "As far as terminology is concerned, we have 
tried to avoid descriptions of the type "the Moerdijk envelop of the 
Reyes topos", in favor of more informative ones". 
           But the true fact was that the only name that was involved was 
"Dubuc", since no other new name was being utilized at the time (of 
course, things as Kock-Lawvere Axiom or Weil algebras were not aimed by 
this philosophy, and "Moerdijk envelop of the Reyes topos" was an 
invention).
            
           D)  I should mention here that I do not ignore the fact that 
my work is  acknowledged and referenced in the monograph  [M-R], and that 
this can be proved in a court of Law. The matter is much more subtle, and 
nobody can deny the evidence of the following consequence of this 
maneuvering: 
            A consequence of this maneuvering is that my name, as time 
passes, and as young people appear, is less and less associated with a 
subject that I created and developed in large part. Namely, models of SDG 
adapted to classical differential geometry. People talk as if the well 
adapted models were always there, or start referring to them in a way 
that may lead inexperienced (in the subject)  readers  to believe that 
these constructions are "M-R way of doing models", as I quoted at the 
beginning of this note. This is what it is actually happening, and no 
arguing can deny it.

            E) This does not do justice to my work, and does not 
corresponds to the true history of the subject.  As an starting point to 
remedy it, I request all workers that need to use the topos G, to refer 
to it as "Dubuc Topos". After all, it is a long tradition in mathematics 
to associate proper names to important concepts or constructions when it 
is justified, as I believe it is the case here.       
            

         Eduardo J. Dubuc    Buenos Aires, September 2000.

Lutz Schroeder asked:

    Does the functor

    Cat^op ---> CAT

    A  |-->   [A,Set]

    reflect isomorphisms (more generally: limits)?

Peter Johnston's answer to the first question is the right one, but 
one could expand. There's no doubt that his argument works well for
small categories (which, I take it, is what was intended by the 
notation), there's a little worry about it working for _locally_ small
categories, and there's no hope at all that it works for arbitrary 
categories, even if we restrict to those categories with small numbers
of objects. (As for the second -- parenthetical -- question: see the
bottom.)

For the fun of it, consider the one-object category whose maps are 
named by pairs  <X,f>  where  X  is a finite set and  f  is a 
permutation thereon. I'll say that  <X,f>  and  <Y,g>  name the same
map if the supports of  f  and  g  are both contained in the 
intersection of  X  and  Y, and further, when  f  and  g  are
restricted to that intersection, they become equal. Given the names of
any two maps, one can always choose names with the same first 
coordinates and that's enough to tell you how to compose them.

There's a functor from this big one-object category to the tiny one-
object category usually called the group, Z_2, to wit, the signature 
functor. This functor is carried by  [-,Set]  to an isomorphism in 
CAT.

Also for the fun of it, here's a proof for locally small categories
that doesn't require considering things like small projectives in 
super-big categories. It's routine to reduce to the case where  T  may
be assumed the be the inclusion functor of a lluf subcategory (one 
that contains all identity maps)  *A*  into a category  *B*. The  next
step is to show that  *A*  is a retract of  *B*.

For any object  A, let  H^A  denote the covariant set-valved functor
on  *A*  represented by  A. Assuming that  [T,Set]  is an isomorphism,
let  G^A  be the unique extension of  H^A  to  *B*. For any  f:A -> X
in  *A*  and  g:X -> Y  in  *B*  (G^A'g)'(f)  is a map in  *A*  from  
A  to  Y. Note that this is not defined as a composition of maps 
(indeed, G^A'g  is not defined as a map in any category other than the
category of sets) but as the application of a function  G^A'g  on an 
element  f  in  G^A'X, hence I will avoid using catenation for other
than composition by inserting prime-marks (for application). The
functoriality says that for  h:Y -> Z  we have  

1:          (G^A'h)'((G^A'g)'f) = (G^A'(hg))'f  

(and, of course, (G^A'1)'(f) = f).

Now let  j:B -> A  be a map in  *A*. The natural transformation  H^j
extends uniquely to a transformation  G^j.  But since the two  Gs
do the same thing to objects as the two  Hs  we know that G^j and  H^j
do the same thing to those objects. We have, therefore,

2:          ((G^A'g)'(f))(j) = (G^B'g)'(fj).

Construct  U:*B* --> *A*  by defining  U(g) = (G^X'g)'1  for
g:X -> Y.  For  h:Y -> Z  in  *A*  we have (using 1)  U(hg) =
(G^X'(hg))'1  =  (G^X'h)'((G^X'g)'1) = (G^X'h)'(Ug)  and  (using 2)
the later is equal to  (G'X'h)'(1Ug) = (G^Y'h)'1)(Ug) = (Uh)(Ug).

Consider the two endo-functors on  *B*, the identity functor and the
idempotent  *B* --> *A*  --> *B*.  The hypothesis that  [T,Set]  is an
isomorphism says that for any set-valued  F  on  *B*  it is the case
that  F  is equal to  *B* --> *A* --> *B* --> Set. But the set-valued
functors (indeed, just the representables) are collectively faithful,
and that forces  *B* --> *A* --> *B*  to be the identity functor,
which, in turn, forces each of  *B* --> *A*  and  *A*  --> *B*  to be
identity functors. The later functor is the given  T.


Finally, as for the question about reflecting limits: if I may quote
Cats and Alligators: "It seems to be a general principle that almost
any property of interest is reflected by [isomorphism-reflecting
embeddings] that preserve it" (1.33) In particular there's an easy
argument for the case of limits in a complete category because a cone
on a diagram fails to be a limit precisely when the induced map from
the limit fails to be an isomorphism.

Does anyone have a full citation to the Nishimura paper which Dubuc justly
criticizes for misattributing his construction?

I am interested because the title, and lack of care with citations, suggest
the possibility that Nishimura is simply reproving results from my paper

D.N. Yetter, "Models for Synthetic Supergeometry", Cahier de Top. et Geom.
Diff. Cat. 29 (2) (1988) 87-108.

In that paper, I constructed "super" analogues of both the Dubuc and Stein
toposes, and examined some of their properties in light of the then-extant
understanding of SDG and supergeometry.

I have just received from Ann Harrison the sad news that Dave died last
Dec. 21.  I suspect that most of the younger practitioners of category
theory are not aware of Dave's contributions to the subject.  Not in the
sense of having actively worked on it, but of having encouraged it in the
very early days.  When he came to Penn he taught a course in homological
algebra that used categories extensively.  In point of fact, I had never
heard of a category before taking that course.  Then he was one of the
main organizers of the La Jolla conference in 1965 that was the first
ever major international conference in categories.  (The first conference
that I am aware of was the midwest category meeting that Saunders Mac Lane
organized in April (I think) of the same year, a few months earlier.  But
the participants consisted only of a handful of people from Urbana and
Chicago.)  

For anyone who wishes to write Ann, her address is 12 Striper Lane,
Chatham, MA 02633.

i quote from yetter's message:

"Does anyone have a full citation to the Nishimura paper which Dubuc
justly
criticizes for misattributing his construction?

I am interested because the title, and lack of care with citations,
suggest
the possibility that Nishimura is simply reproving results from my paper

D.N. Yetter, "Models for Synthetic Supergeometry", Cahier de Top. et Geom.
Diff. Cat. 29 (2) (1988) 87-108."

Nishimura's paper is titled "Supersmooth Topoi" (I have a only a preprint)

It is a  well referenced paper. In this paper Nishimura knows and
comments on Yetter's (1988). It is actually doing a different thing.

He uses my (with Taubin) construction with the notion of analytic ring
(1983), which is not to be found in [M-R] monograph. This notion is
algebraic but in the sense of a category with finite limits, not in the
sense of a category with finite products. (quotients are not suryective to
mention a difference)

just to clarify my letter, i quote again Yetter above:

"Dubuc justly criticizes for misattributing his construction?"

Well, Nishimura is using as a reference for my construction the
[M-R] monograph, and it is not at fault as I said. The problem is, that it
sounds ambigous because a whole situation I described in my letter

I quote now again from the [M-R] monograph two references concerning
specifically my work, which I found they  reveal a lot:

"Although this general notion of C-infinity
ring does not occur as such in classical analysis and differential
geometry, the main examples do ...  Given the role of these examples of
C-infinity rings in the classical literature, it is not surprising that
although the statements of several of the results in this chapter seem
new, most of their proofs are either known or easily derivable from known
ones".

"As far as terminology is concerned, we have
tried to avoid descriptions of the type "the Moerdijk envelop of the
Reyes topos", in favor of more informative ones"

well ...         eduardo dubuc

Dear all,

I don't remember where I could find a characterization for
a simplicial set to be the simplicial nerve of some strict
globular omega-category ? I think that  the characterization
is that the simplicial set must be given with a structure
of thin elements satisfying some axioms like the filling of
horners and thin horners. Could you send me a reference please ?

Thank you in advance. pg.

Hi Philippe,

The answer to your question is that, to my knowledge, the characterisation
of the nerves of n-categories currently only exists in conjectural form in
the literature. In particular, a full description of this conjecture is
given in the paper:

"The Algebra of Oriented Simplexes" by Ross Street (JPAA 49 (1987) pp
283-335)

and an associated note "Fillers for Nerves" (I forget the precise reference)
which proves the necessity of this characterisation.

This actual conjecture is originally due to John Roberts - it does involve
simplicial sets enriched with a distinguished set of "hollow" or "thin"
simplices and appropriate "admissible" horn filler conditions with respect
to these thin simplices. Roberts calls these structures "complicial sets".

I presented a proof of this conjecture to a conference at UC Berkeley (MSRI)
in 1993 (I think) and also in a number of seminars given at Bangor in Wales
and at the Sydney Category Seminar, but unfortunately never published the
result, due to a subsequent career change (I became an investment banker).
Roberts' original conjecture as described by Street does indeed hold - in
fact a slightly weaker result may be proved which only involves fillers for
"inner" horns.

More recently, I have taken some time away from the world of finance and am
currently working on writing up my results in this area - which I hope to
make available over the next few months.

All the very best

The category of abelian groups (or modules over a ring object) in a
Grothendieck topos does not have any non-zero projectives in general.  But
free modules are still flat (because the associated sheaf functor
preserves sums and monics) and so every module has a flat resolution and
this ought to suffice to define Tor.  But there are some delicate
questions involving well-definedness and functoriality because you cannot
lift maps between flats.  Does anyone know if this has been published
anywhere?

                                WADT/CoFI 2001
   15th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques
                                  joint with
              General Workshop of the CoFI WG & CASL Tutorial


                                Genova, Italy
                                1-3 April 2001
                      http://www.disi.unige.it/wadt2001/


Aims and Scope
==============
The  algebraic approach to system  specification and development, born
as a formal  method for  abstract  data types,  encompasses today  the
formal    design of integrated  hardware    and software systems,  new
specification   frameworks     and programming  paradigms    (such  as
object-oriented, logic and  higher-order functional programming) and a
wide  range of   application  areas (including  information   systems,
concurrent and distributed systems).

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

    -   algebraic specification
    -   other approaches to formal specification
    -   specification languages and methods
    -   term rewriting and proof systems
    -   specification development systems (concepts, tools, etc.)

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing
work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

The workshop will start with a full day tutorial on CoFI, the Common
Framework Initiative for algebraic specification and development of
software, see http://www.brics.dk/Projects/CoFI.  This tutorial will
also be available to people who do not wish to participate in the rest
of the workshop.  Besides the tutorial, there will be CoFI Task Group
meetings and presentation on related topics during the workshop.

The workshop will be a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences
on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS2001).
Special deals will be available for participants wishing to attend
WADT/CoFI 2001 together with other events of ETAPS.
More information on ETAPS is available at
                  http://www.disi.unige.it/etaps2001/

Submissions
===========

The  scientific  programme  of the workshop will include  up to about 30
presentations of recent results and ongoing research.  The presentations
will be  selected  according to  originality, significance,  and general
interest, on the basis of submitted  abstracts.  The selection committee
consists of the WADT Steering Committee together with the local organizers
(listed below).

The abstracts must  be in pdf (or standard postscript) format, up to two
pages  long in the style  for publication in  Lecture  Notes in  Computer
Science (see  http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html), and should
be sent by e-mail to wadt2001@disi.unige.it.

The deadline for submission of abstracts is

     10 January, 2001.

Abstracts that  substantially depart from the required  format, style or
length may be rejected without consideration.

The final versions of the selected abstracts (due by 26 February) will be
made available on the workshop web page, and included in a hand-out for
the workshop participants.

After  the  workshop, selected  authors will  be invited  to  submit full
papers for the  refereed  proceedings, which is expected to be published
as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/).

Location
========
WADT/CoFI 2001 will be held in Genova.

Abstract:

We study syntax-free models for name-passing processes. For
interleaving semantics, we identify the indexing structure 
required of an early labelled transition system to support the usual
pi-calculus operations, defining Indexed Labelled Transition 
Systems. For non-interleaving causal semantics we define Indexed
Labelled Asynchronus Transition Systems, smoothly generalizing both
our interleaving model and the standard Asynchronous Transition
Systems model for CCS-like calculi. In each case we relate a
denotational semantics to an operational view, for bisimulation and
causal bisimulation respectively. We establish completeness properties
of, and adjunctions between, categories of the two models. Alternative
indexing structures and possible applications are also
discussed. These are first steps towards a uniform understanding of
the semantics and operations of name-passing calculi.
