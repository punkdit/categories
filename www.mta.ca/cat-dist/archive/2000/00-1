Peter's last posting reminded me of something that may or may not be
relevant.  Sometime in the previous millennium (actually, around 3
decades ago) John Isbell made an observation that amounted to the
statment that the equational theory of the unit ball functor of banach
spaces (which has many more algebras than banach spaces) could be
described by negation and an aleph_0-ary operation that takes {x_i} to
\sum_{i=1}^\infty 2^{-i}x_i (and appropriate equations).  Now a midpoint
algebra with involution, as described by Peter, has all such finitary
sums and if you also assume it complete, I think it is likely exactly a
model of the banach space theory.

Apologies for going off at a tangent, but someone ought to pick up Vaughan's
throwaway remark that the `Conway' coalgebra structure on [-\infty,\infty]
is the unique `natural' structure that makes it a final coalgebra. There is
another one, which was (implicitly) pointed out by Simon Norton around the 
time (early 1970s) when Conway was developing the theory of surreal numbers.

Conway's definition is based on the idea that the simplest number between
0 and 1/2 is 1/4, the simplest between 1/4 and 1/2 is 3/8, and so on; thus
the simplest number in any nontrivial interval is always a dyadic rational
(i.e. one whose denominator is a power of 2). Suppose you want to regard all
rationals as simple, and use smallness of denominator as a measure of
simplicity; then you would say that the simplest number between 0 and 1/2 is
1/3, the simplest between 1/3 and 1/2 is 2/5, .... Norton observed that this
notion of simplicity can be encoded by the notion of continued fraction, as 
follows:

Define a bijection f: [0,1] --> [0,1] as follows: if x has binary expansion
.00...011...100...011...1..., where there are a (\geq 0) zeros in the first
block, then a block of b (\geq 1) 1's, then c (\geq 1) zeros, and so on, then 
f(x) is the continued fraction

            1
         --------------------
         (a+1) + 1
                 ------------
                 b + 1
                     ---------
                     c + ......

Thus, for example, if x = 1/4, its two binary expansions .0100000... and
.00111111... yield the two expressions

            1                                1
         --------------      and          ----------
         2 + 1                            3 + 1
             ----------                       ------
             1 + 1                            \infty
                 ------
                 \infty

for f(1/4) = 1/3. Extend f to a function R --> R by invariance under integer
translations, i.e. f(x + n) = f(x) + n if n is an integer (and set 
f(\infty) = \infty, f(-\infty) = -\infty, if you insist). Then if x is the 
Conway-simplest number in the interval (a,b), f(x) is the Norton-simplest
number in (f(a),f(b)). Similarly, one can conjugate the `Conway' coalgebra
structure on [-\infty,\infty] by the function f, to obtain a different
(but isomorphic, and hence also final) coalgebra structure which has an 
explicit definition in terms of operations on continued fractions.

I believe the function f appears in `Winning Ways' (I don't have my copy to
hand) in the context of a game called `Contorted Fractions' (`contorted' is
of course a Conwayesque conflation of `continued' and `Norton'). There are
many mysteries about it. It obviously maps the dyadic rationals bijectively 
to the set of all rationals (and the non-dyadic rationals to the quadratic
irrationals); it is strictly increasing, but it's not hard to see that its
inverse is differentiable at every rational with derivative zero. Whether
it's differentiable anywhere else is, I believe, an open problem (though
there are certainly points where it's not differentiable). If you sketch
its graph, you will see that (as well as fixing all half-integers) it has a
fixed point in the interval (0,1/2) -- it's somewhere around 0.42, in decimal
notation -- but we never managed to prove that this fixed point was unique,
let alone determine whether it is algebraic or transcendental.

Happy New Year,
Peter Johnstone

Thanks, Peter.  One of these days I'll learn to stop sending email after
midnight.  Continued fractions provide equally good coalgebraic structure
for both our product-with-omega functor (it's one of the examples in
our paper) and Peter F.'s X v X functor.  Either midnight madness or
sheer forgetfulness must have possessed me to malign its applicability
to the latter.

While I have that excuse handy let me also repair my description (in
the same message) of halving nonzero reals as right-shifting with sign
extension: following the shift the second bit must then be complemented.
Thus + (1/2) halves to +- (1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4) while +++ (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8
= 7/8) halves to +-++ (1/2 - 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 = 7/16).  In the special
case of 1 as ++++... forever, +-+++... equals + (1/2), and dually for -1.

Contorted fractions make an earlier appearance in Conway's On Numbers
and Games (1976) (Winning Ways is 1983).  I hadn't realized Norton was
involved there: Conway credits several things to Norton in ONAG but I
guess he must have forgotten that one.

At the risk of turning this thread into a complete tangent space, yet
another construction of the group of reals is as the quotient G/H of the
pointwise-additive group G of bounded integer sequences by the subgroup H
consisting of those sequences b of the form b_0 = a_0, b_{i+1} = a_{i+1}
- 2a_i for some a in G.  This definition, which avoids detouring through
the rationals, resulted from my mulling over a talk at MIT by Gian-Carlo
Rota in the early 1970's on representing reals as sequences of bits.
I mentioned it at a recent theory lunch talk and Don Knuth mulled it
over and came up with the idea of modifying the boundedness condition
to allow G to be a ring thus making G/H a field (as an alternative to
taking product to be the unique bilinear operation * satisfying 1*1 =
1), see Problem 10689, American Mathematical Monthly, 105(1998), p.769.

I would love to know whether this construction can exploited in a
coalgebraic setting.

Re Mike Barr's comments on Isbell's construction of unit

there is a paper by Denis Higgs (Proc. Koninklijke
Nederlandse Akademie, Series A, Vol. 81, (4), 1978,
pp.448-455) called:  "A Universal Characterization of
[0,\infty]", in which he gives such a characterization,
based on a class of infinitary algebras in which the
infinitary operation arises from the observation that
every element of [0,\infty] can be wrtten as a sum, in
general infinite, of fractions 1/{2^n} 's.  Indeed, 
as Higgs' shows, this characterizes [0,\infty] as a free
algebra of the appropriate kind on one generator.

Granted the point of Y2K compliance was to avoid rolling back to the

that can be taken in various ways.

Perhaps Vaughan is unfamiliar with the following definition of the reals.
I got it from Steve Schanuel.  I believe that he got it from Serge Lang
and he probably got it from Emil Artin.  Anyway, Let S be the ring of
functions s: N --> N such that the function of two variables (m,n) |-->
s(m+n) - s(m) - s(n) is bounded.  Addition is element-wise and
multiplication is functional composition.  Let I consist of the bounded
sequences.  Then R = S/I.  Interestingly, S is not commutative.

We now have a real tangent line.

Given a center-preserving function between intervals, f, is there a 
natural way to obtain from it one that's midpoint-preserving? Part of
preserving midpoints is preserving halving: f(hx) = hf(x).  We can
rewrite that to convert from a commutativity condition to a fixed-
point condition:  f = \x.2f(hx)  (the fixed-pont of an operation that
seems to be innate to every graphing calculator). The process needn't
converge, indeed, one will often need to shrink the domain of the
function down to a smaller concentric interval and it can converge to
fixed-points not to our liking (such as  \x.x*sin(2pi*log|x|/log2).)

But the closed interval is the final coalgebra not just for the 
ordered-wedge functor  X v X  but for for the ordered-wedge of any
positive number of copies of  X. (There's a general theorem that says
that a final coalgebra for  X v X  is automatically a final coalgebra
for  X v X v X v X, indeed, for any such ordered-wedge where the number
of copies of  X  is a power of two. I haven't been able to find the 
proof for a general theorem that specializes to  X v X v X.)

Using that the closed interval is the final coalgebra for  X v X v X
we can define the thirding map  t:I --> I  in a manner similar to (and
simpler than) the definition of the halving map. (Yes, the OED lists
"third" as a verb) So we are also looking for solutions to
f = \x.3f(tx). 

We obtain a commutative monoid of operators of the form  \fx.nf(x/n).
The process of applying a one-generator free monoid of operators
easily generalizes to an arbitrary commutative monoid of operators.
Starting with a center-preserving  f  between intervals the process
needn't converge even if we restrict the domain to a smaller
concentric interval. But if it does converge to the germ of a
monotonic duality-preserving function then it converges to a germ of a
midpoint-preserving function from the original source interval to the
original target interval. And if these intervals should coincide, it
converges to what in my last posting I defined as an element of the
reals.

I believe the idea *came* from Artin but I don't believe Artin was 
thinking of it as a *construction* of the reals.  I was so taken by 
the construction that I thought it should be better known by tertiary 
teachers.  I wrote a little note

	An efficient construction of the real numbers,
	Gazette Australian Math. Soc. 12 (1985) 57-58

on the construction (giving credit to Schanuel and reporting that 
Peter Johnstone told me Richard Lewis from Sussex had also come up 
with it).
[Warning and Challenge: Steve pointed out that my note messes up the 
construction of the sup operation.]

Happy 2000 plus.

It's true I only learned about the Artin(?)-Schanuel construction
recently---Peter Freyd mentioned it to Phil Scott and me at lunch one
day at LL'96 in Tokyo, albeit with yet another attribution, Conway.
I thought it was very cute.

There is some sort of duality that I don't understand between this
construction and the Knuth-Pratt construction.  The former puts
the bounded sequences in the denominator and does the work in the
numerator, namely requiring that s(m+n) = s(m) + s(n) to within a
constant independent of m and n.  The latter puts the bounded sequences
in the numerator and does the work in the denominator, namely modding
out by the equation x/2 + x/2 = x, where x/2 is defined as right shift
(prepend zero).

Artin-Schanuel can be related to Dedekind as follows.  For Dedekind,
the unreduced rationals m/n together with all m/0 constitute Z^2,
the lattice points of the plane, whose nonempty rays are then the
reduced rationals.  The irrationals along with infinity (thinking of
the real line projectively) are then obtained as the empty rays, all
of which make distinct Dedekind cuts in the rationals, qua rays *or*
qua irreduced rationals (actually two cuts are needed in the projective
line, infinity supplies the other).  Artin-Schanuel identifies all but
the ray at infinity in terms of their neighborhoods instead of cuts,
specifying one point of the neighborhood per column.

Moving the bounded sequences from the denominator to the numerator
doesn't seem to be compatible with this picture.  What picture if any
is it compatible with?  And is there a categorical duality that goes
along with this inversion?  A passage from algebra to coalgebra perhaps?
Or is it the duality of addition and multiplication---we have
s(m+n) = s(m) + s(n) doing the work above and x/2 + x/2 = x at work
underneath, albeit with addition also party to the latter.

in Functorial ML with the efficient execution based on shape analysis,
as developed in FISh1. FISh2 will support both functional and
imperative programming styles across a wide range of data
types. 

A key application area is high-performance computing, where high
expressivity and performance are both key issues. A second goal is to
develop a specialised version of FISh, called GoldFISh, which supports
a shape-based cost model that is able to predict performance across a
wide range of parallel architectures. 

Postdoctoral Research Fellow
----------------------------

The postdoctoral research fellow will take a key role in the
implementation of FISh2. This will require broad understanding of
typed programming languages, the ability to convert high-level
language designs, often expressed in formal logical notation, into
implementations written in both functional and imperative styles. They
must be willing to learn the principles of shape theory.

A doctorate in a relevant branch of computer science or mathematics is
essential, as is the demonstrated ability in at least one of the areas
of compiler construction, semantics of programming languages or
parallel programming. Knowledge of some of type theory, term
rewriting, functional programming, skeletons or data distribution
strategies is desirable.

The applicant must have personal skills adequate to work in a small
team with both senior and junior colleagues, and written communication
skills appropriate for producing clearly documented code, user
documentation, material suitable for the web-site, and formal papers
for refereed publication.

The position is full-time for three years at a salary of Australian
$43,254 - $55,418 p.a. beginning early in 2000. 

Research Assistant Grade 2
--------------------------

The second assistant will develop most of the benchmarking programs
necessary to establish that FISh2 and GoldFISh have the properties we
claim for them. This will require the ability to learn novel, and
unstable programming languages without adequate documentation. They
must be able to give informal feedback on the usability of the
language. They must understand the basic principles of parallel
programming. They must use these languages to encode applications from
science and engineering, and perform tests to capture execution
properties. They must be willing to assist in other duties, such as
web-site maintenance, as required. They will be set weekly goals, and
expected to seek help actively when necessary.

A first degree in a relevant branch of computer science is essential,
as is some knowledge of functional programming, the use of types in
programming, and principles of program testing and
benchmarking. Experience in system development is desirable.

                              for the

    WORKSHOP ON COALGEBRAIC METHODS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE (CMCS'2000)




Scope

State-based dynamical systems as found throughout computing
science are traditionally described as transition systems or
certain kinds ofautomata. During the last decade, it has become
increasingly clear that such systems can be captured uniformly as
so-called ``coalgebras'' (which are the formal dual of algebras).
Coalgebra is beginning to develop into a field of its own, with
its own proof-methods (involving bisimulations and invariants).
This workshop will be devoted to both an introduction to basic
coalgebraic notions and techniques, and also to some recent
advances in the theory of coalgebras.

We are looking for participants and contributed talks to this
informal workshop on both the theory and the use of coalgebras in
computer science. The workshop will consist of two days, preceding
the ETAPS conference (25-26 March, 2000) at the Technical
University of Berlin. More information regarding submissions is
given below.

The scope of the meeting includes the following themes:

 - the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and categorical
      approaches);
 - coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for programming
      languages, dynamic systems, etc.);
 - coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent) programming;
 - coalgebras and data types;
 - (coinductive) definition and proof principles for coalgebras (with
      bisimulations or invariants);
 - coalgebras and (hidden-sorted) algebras;
 - coalgebraic specification and verification;
 - coalgebras and (modal) logic

Organization: Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen), Horst Reichel(Dresden), Jan Rutten
(CWI,
 Amsterdam) and Larry Moss (Bloomington, IN).

Program Committee: H. Peter Gumm (Marburg), Bart Jacobs (Nijmegen),
 Ugo Montanari (Pisa), Larry Moss (Bloomington, IN), Ataru T.
Nakagawa (Tokyo), John Power (Edinburgh), Horst Reichel (Dresden),
Jan Rutten (CWI, Amsterdam).

Submissions

The following dates are important for submission to the ENTCS volume.

   -  3 January 2000: deadline for submissions.
   -  11 February 2000: notification of acceptance.
   -  3 March 2000: final version.
   -  25-26 March 2000: workshop, where a printed version of the ENTCS
      issue will be available for participants.
   -  (25 March - 2 April, 2000: ETAPS conference).

The ideal submission is not longer than 20 pages, and gives a clear
exposition
of the relevant ideas. It can be sent by email to: Horst Reichel, or by
ordinary mail to:

                          General Information

Geneva is situated along the banks of Lac Leman and Le Rhone.
The lake showcases the plumed fountain Jet d'Eau, and various districts
of Geneva are connected by bridges across the waterways.
The University of Geneva where ICALP '00 will convene is located on the
`Left Bank' off Place Neuve and along the Promenade des Bastions
near the Old Town section of Geneva.

Geneva is a city of water parks and gardens and welcoming walkways
which encourage exploration of the historical sites, museums, and
international business and shopping districts. The University of
Geneva is located near `Old Town' an area dotted with sidewalk
cafes, student life, and building antiquities dating back to the 5th
century.

Geneva is a crossroads situated in the heart of Europe and linked to
the world by a vast network of motorways, airlines and railways. For
those planning to attend ICALP '00 in Geneva, it is an excellent
opportunity to organize short trips into the countryside of charming
villages and vineyards. Tours to please all ages and interests are
available including afternoon train excursions, shopping cruises on
Lake Geneva and The Rhone, and bus and cablecar trips in the Alps.
For some, the most inviting attraction will be mouintain climbing.
Mont Blanc, one of the highest points in Europe and the city of Chamonix
are less than an hour away.


Accomodations at a very special ICALP rate have been reserved in a
couple of hotels and very inexpensive rooms will be available at
the Student Housing.  Lunch will be served daily on campus
and there will be morning and afternoon refreshment breaks.
Note that the specially  priced hotel accommodations reserved
for ICALP participants are located only a 5-10 minute walk to
the campus.

Hi,

My name is Lars Lindqvist and I wonder if there are any packages which makes 
it possible to include diagrams in documents on the WWW in a conveniant 
manner? What I have in mind are packages similar to the existing packages 
for the creation of diagrams in e.g. LaTex.

Very simple diagrams can probably be specified using the table construct in 
MathML but problems occur quite rapidly as the diagrams become more 
complicated. MathML is simply not intended for specification of such 
diagrams. See e.g. the last paragraph in section 7.1.5.2 of the MathML 
specification http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-MathML2-19991222:

" Finally, apart from the introduction of new glyphs, many of the situations 
where one might be inclined to use an image amount to some sort of labeled 
diagram. For example, knot diagrams, Venn diagrams, Dynkin diagrams, Feynman 
diagrams and complicated commutative diagrams all fall into this category. 
As such, their content would be better encoded via some combination of 
structured graphics and MathML markup. Because of the generality of the 
`labeled diagram' construction, the definition of a markup language to 
encode such constructions extends beyond the scope of the W3C Math activity. 
(See http://www.w3.org/Graphics for further W3C activity in this area.) "

Following this suggestion I have made some initial attemts to construct an 
XML markup language for diagrams. I have also written a XSL (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language) schema that transforms diagrams specified in this 
language to a VML (Vector Markup Language) specification which can be 
rendered by e.g. Internet Explorer 5. There is a lot of work involved in a 
project like this so I am really interested to hear about other attempts and 
experiences before I continue.

I would suggest doing it in tex and then converting it to pdf, which is
quickly coming to be a standard for the web.  There are at least two ways
of doing tex --> pdf that cost no money.  (You can also get Adobe
distiller, but that costs actual money.)  There is something called
pdflatex, that I have not used but it comes free with the tex distribution
from CTAN (it is essentially undocumented, so if you figure it out, I
would like to know about how it works.  A second, not entirely
satisfactory is to use the ability of gsview to output pdf files.  You
choose print to disk and then you get a pdf file that can be read with the
Adobe reader.  It is common practice to put a link to the free download of
the Adobe reader when you post a pdf file, but most users of the web
probably have it by now.

Dear Lars,

A propos of your message to categories, I really cannot understand
why anyone would want to use any (existing) language other than
LaTeX for writing mathematics.  HTML and its developments seem to
me to be much less expressive and much more bureaucratic, especially
for writing (ordinary) mathematics.  That readers using the web have
inferior browsers is, to me, an argument for developing and promoting
better browsers, not for forcing mathematical authors to use worse
mark-up languages.

With existing web technology, there are ways of putting LaTeX 
formulae, diagrams, etc on web pages by translating them into
PostScript and then GIF files (LaTeX2HTML does this).  For simple
mathematical formulae, TTH makes full use of the (limited) features
of HTML, without using GIFs, and is what I used to translate my book
into HTML (though I had to write a substantial program to simplify
by LaTeX before TTH could cope with it).

Regarding diagrams, my view is that there is no "generic" diagram
problem - particular kinds of diagram are for me two-dimensional
variations on particular kinds of formal languages.   My own TeX
package does a good job of commutative diagrams for certain (but
not all) parts of category theory.  It is conceived as a way in
which to write two-dimensional formulae, not as a way of "drawing".

Still beta I believe, but works well.

Best results are obtained by using type 1 fonts and the most recent version
of ghostscript, currently 5.97, or maybe 6.

Another possibility, which I've found gives the best results,
is to use a free program called dvipdfm:

	Functorial Lambda-calculus
		 C. Barry Jay


Functorial lambda-calculus represents some type constructors as
functors, whose quantification supports new forms of polymorphism.
This is exploited by a powerful new generic programming technique,
called program extension, whose evaluation does not use explicit
types. It can be used to define all the standard second-order
combinators, for mapping, folding, etc. so that they apply to
arbitrary data types. It can also be used to define generic functions
for equality, addition, assignment and shape. In particular, shape
evaluation can be used to support static specialisation, and to reduce
space usage.

This paper introduces the calculus, provides a type inference
algorithm, and shows how to augment its expressive power and improve
its efficiency by adding more constructions and optimising evaluation.

Paul and Michael,

There is perhaps no realistic alternative to LaTeX for writing mathematics 
today, but MathML is a language for the future and I like the visions and 
the goals associated with this language. I will not try to argue for MathML 
here because this is done in the specification (actually a draft) at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-MathML2-19991222. As discussed in Section 1.3.1 
(Layered Design of Mathematical Web Services) MathML provides the lower 
level of a two layer architecture where LaTeX would be a language (tool) at 
the higher level (generating MathML code).

There already exists several different tools for converting LaTeX to MathML 
so a straightforward solution would be to construct a converter also for 
some popular diagram specification language (package). Since MathML does not 
support the specification of  complicated labelled diagrams the output would 
be a mixture of MathML and e.g. VML (or SVG) which are markup languages for 
vector graphics. This would also be in accordance with Section 7.1.5.2 of 
the MathML specification.

So I suppose I have to reformulate my question from my first letter and ask 
whether there are any such tools or converters?

I do not know much about the PDF format. When I publish a document written 
in LaTeX on the web I usually generate a postscript version and a PDF 
version (generated using Adobe distiller).

Thanks for your replies.

Lars L

MikTeX, a free TeX implementation for PC's (and possibly other platforms,
I'm not certain) comes with a dvi-to-pdf converter, called dvipdfm.  Use it

Call for Papers:

                 Linz2000
Mathematical Aspects of Non-Classical Logics
          and Fuzzy Inference

To be held at Bildungszentrum St. Magdalena, Linz, Austria
June 13-18, 2000
Sponsored by: FLLL Fuzzy Logic Laboratorium Linz - Hagenberg

------SHORT DESCRIPTION OF SEMINAR PURPOSE/MISSION-------

Since their inception in 1979 the Linz Seminars on Fuzzy Sets have
emphasized the development of mathematical aspects of fuzzy sets by
bringing together researchers in fuzzy sets and established mathematicians
whose work outside the fuzzy setting can provide direction for further
research. The seminar is deliberately kept small and initimate so that
informal critical discussion remains central. There are no parallel
sessions and during the week there are several round tables to discuss
open problems and promising directions for further work. Linz2000 will be
the 21st seminar carrying on this tradition.

Linz2000 will deal with Mathematical Aspects of Non-classical Logics and
Fuzzy Inference. It is the hope of the organizers that the talks will
provide a mathematical setting for both the theory and the practice of
logical means of dealing with inference under uncertainty, limited
resources, modalities of place, time, and state of knowledge.

This Seminar will consider, but not be limited to, the following topics
in logic: 
1. Categorical Logic 
2. Logic of cognition 
3. Fuzzy Inference 
4. Modal Logics 
5. Many Valued Logics 
6. Logics taking into account time, place, vagueness, and limited
resources


The total number of participants is usually bounded above by 40 with broad
international representation and a mix of pure and applied interests.
Invited talks are usually allowed an hour and a half and contributed talks
45 minutes. There are no parallel sessions. The Seminar will feature ample
time for discussion of each presentation, a fundamental aspect of the Linz
tradition. The schedule allows for daily round tables for discussion of
open problems and issues raised by the day's talks.

If you are interested in giving a contributed talk, please submit an
abstract of no more than 650 words to the Program Chair, Lawrence Stout. 
The deadline for all submissions is 15 February 2000; and you should
be notified no later than 15 April, 2000 concerning acceptance of your
presentation into the Seminar.


It is preferred that your submission be made by e-mail, in which case
it is also preferred that this submission be a LaTeX 2e (or 2.09) file
in ASCII: please, no zipped files. The subject line for such an e-mail
should include the phrase 
        Linz2000 Seminar
and it should be addressed to
        lstout@sun.iwu.edu

It would also be helpful if your submission included your snail-mail
address, fax number, and any additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers
that you deem helpful.

This is a comment to the recently discussed Pavlovic-Pratt paper: M. Barr
has proved in "Terminal Coalgebras ..."( TCS 114) that for bicontinuous
set functors initial algebras carry a natural metric, and a Cauchy
completion of that space is a final coalgebra. This result can be
generalized to endofunctors F of any locally finitely presentable
category. Side conditions: F preserve monomorphisms and have a point in
F(O). Of the two functors used by Dusko and Vaughan, only F_2 satisfies
the latter, of course. Its initial algebra is the set of all rationals in
[O,1), which illustrates the idea quite well. The statement of the
generalization I have in mind is that the structure of a final coalgebra T
(which in a locally finitely presentable category is determined by
morphisms from all finitely presentable objects B into T) is determined by
the structure of an initial algebra I in the following sense: each
hom(B,I) carries a natural metric and a Cauchy completion is hom(B,T).
Thus, for endofunctors of Pos not only the elements of T but also its
order is obtained by completing I .

My constructionof the reals, referred to by Ross and Mike, came fom an
observation of Tate about bilinear maps many years earlier, which
essentially goes back to Eudoxus. I take the task to be relating the
continuous to the discrete, rather than constructing the former from the
latter, but never mind. R is the ring of endomorphisms E(T(L))of the group
T(L) of translations (rigid maps at finite distance from the identity) of
the line L. If we start instead with a discrete line D (a line of dots),
then T(D) is isomorphic to Z (additive group without preferred generator).
E(T(D) is the ring Z, but instead take A(T(D)), almost homomorphisms Z
to Z. A(T(D)) is an additive group with a multiplication by composition,
but not a ring, since one distributive law and commutativity of
multiplication fail; but A(T(D)) modulo bounded maps (much as in Mikes
description) is R.

OVERALL TOPIC AND FORMAT OF WORKSHOP:
   The IFIP WG 1.7 on "Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and
   Design" has been recently established to investigate the theoretical
   foundations of security, discovering and promoting new areas of
   application of theoretical techniques in computer security and supporting
   the systematic use of formal techniques in the development of security
   related applications.  The members of WG will hold their annual workshop
   as an open event to which all researchers working on the theory of
   computer security are invited.
   The program will encourage discussions by all attendees, both during and
   after scheduled presentations on participants' ongoing work.  Extended
   abstracts of work presented at the Workshop will be collected and
   distributed to the participants; no proceedings are foreseen for this
   year's workshop.

POSSIBLE TOPICS FOR SUBMITTED PAPERS:
   Researchers are invited to submit abstracts of original work on topics in
   the spirit of the workshop.  Possible topics for submitted papers
   include, but are not limited to:
   - formal definition and verification of the various aspects of security:
     confidentiality, integrity, authentication and availability;
   - new theoretically-based techniques for the formal analysis and design
     of cryptographic protocols and their manifold applications (e.g.,
     electronic commerce);
   - information flow modelling and its application to the theory of
     confidentiality policies, composition of systems, and covert channel
     analysis;
   - formal techniques for the analysis and verification of mobile code;
   - formal analysis and design for prevention of denial of service.

The preprint

"The Syntax of Coherence"

is available on
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.CT/9910006

Abstract: This article tackles categorical coherence within a two-dimensional
generalization of Lawvere's functorial semantics. 2-theories, a syntactical
way of describing categories with structure, are presented. From the
perspective here afforded, many coherence results become simple 
statements about the quasi-Yoneda lemma and 2-theory-morphisms.
Given two 2-theories and a 2-theory-morphism between them, we 
explore the induced relationship between the corresponding 2-categories
of algebras. The strength of the induced quasi-adjoints are classified 
by the strength of the 2-theory-morphism. These quasi-adjoints reflect
the extent to which one structure can be replaced by another.
A two-dimensional analogue of the Kronecker product is defined 
and constructed. This operation allows one to generate new coherence 
laws from old ones. 


All the best, 
Noson S. Yanofsky

About an associative bifunctor I wrote

  There's a general theorem that says that a final coalgebra for 
  X v X  is automatically a final coalgebra for  X v X v X v X,
  indeed, for any such ordered-wedge where the number of copies of  X
  is a power of two. I haven't been able to find the proof for a 
  general theorem that specializes to  X v X v X.

Well, the proof is just a modification of an old one (of mine). And
once in hand, it makes clear the nonsensical nature of the
construction for the thirding map that appeared in my "Derivatives"
posting. (I'll replace it with a better construction in a later
posting.)

The general theorem is that if  T  is an endo-functor on a category 
with coproducts and if  f:F --> TF  is a final coalgebra then

   f     Tfn
F --> TF --> TTF  is a final  TT-coalgebra. (Citation below, albeit
for the dual case -- it appears that not everyone has noticed that
just by replacing the category in question with its dual one can
transfer any theorem about initial algebras to one about final
coalgebras.)

Let  X*Y  denote the values of a bifunctor (not necessarily 
associative) on a category with binary coproducts.

    If  f:F --> F*F  is a final "square coalgebra" then

        f       f*1
     F --> F*F ----> (F*F)*F  is a final "cubical coalgebra".

Given a cubical coalgebra  a:A --> (A*A)*A  consider the square 
coalgebra  A + A*A  --> (A + A*A)*(A + A*A)   whose left coordinate 

            a           r*l
map  is  A --> (A*A)*A ----> (A + A*A)*(A + A*A)  and whose right

                        l*l
coordinate map is  A*A ----> (A + A*A)*(A + A*A)  where  l  and  r  
denote the left and right coprojections for the coproduct.  Let  
A + A*A  --> F  be the induced map to the final square coalgebra and
let  a'  and  a'' be its coordinate maps. Then

           a'                            a''
     A --------> F        and      A*A ------> F
                                                       (add downward
   a |           | f              1 |          | f      arrowheads)

 (A*A)*A -----> F*F                A*A -----> F*F          
         a''*a'                        a'*a'

Consequently:
                             a'
                    A  --------------> F

                  a |                  | f
                            a''*a'
                (A*A)*A ------------> F*F

                  1 |                  | f*1

                (A*A)*A ---------> (F*F)*F
                        (a'*a')*a'

For the uniqueness, suppose that  a'  is as in the last diagram with
the middle arrow removed. Define  a'' so that the penultimate diagram
commutes (f, by Lambek, is an isomorphism). Then the map from  A + A*A
to  F  whose coordinate maps are  a'  and  a''  is a map of square 
coalgebras, hence  a'  is as already described.

For a counterexample for arbitrary categories, consider the discrete
category with two objects and bifunctor that turns it into the
two-element group. On discrete categories coalgebras are, of course,
the same as fixed points, and the only way a functor can have a final
coalgebra is if it has a unique fixed point. The object that serves
as the identity element for the group structure is thus the final
square coalgebra. But both objects are cubical coalgebras, hence 
there is no final cubical coalgebra.

There's nothing special about the number three. Given any iteration
obtainable from the bifunctor, the constructions above can be 
modified to provide proofs and counterexamples. Indeed, we needn't
restrict to bifunctors. For example, if  TXYZ  is a trifunctor on a 
category with binary coproducts, then a final coalgebra for  TXXX
gives rise to a final coalgebra for  TX(T(TXXX)X)(TXX(TXXX)).

But what I can't find a proof for is the analogue of this theorem,
good for any category (same citation):

  If  T  is an endo-functor and if  TT  has a final coalgebra
  then so does  T.

The analogue would be: if  X*Y  is a bifunctor and if  (X*X)*X  has
a final coalgebra then so does  X*X.  All my counterexamples --  here
and in the citation below -- are on discrete categories. For what it's 
worth, if an associative bifunctor on a discrete category is such that
X*X*X  has a final coalgebra, then so does  X*X.

hi.

i somehow managed to unsubscribe from this list at some point, and almost
missed the thread about coalgebra of reals. i am not sure that i have seen
all the relevant postings, but here are my 2p of thoughts.

if i am not misunderstanding anything, peter freyd's closed interval
coalgebra achieves something that vaughan pratt's and mine do not. we work
with lists and streams and get *irredundant* representations of reals.
however, without redundancy, the algebraic operations on reals are
undecidable. peter's bipointed approach, however, induces a *redundant*
representation. this allows him to extract the algebraic operations
coinductively.

in the talk at the 1998 lisbon workshop on coalgebra (and later in some
seminar talks), i described a redundant coalgebra of conway reals, where
conway's definitions of the field operations were derivable as coalgebra
homomoprhisms. however, the setting seemed too complicated, probably due
to me. peter's definition of the midpoint algebra is considerably simpler,
although the resulting operations are probably still computationally quite
inefficient.

the coalgebra of alternating dyadics, described in the paper with vaughan,
was derived from this 'conway' coalgebra. as explained in sec 3.4, it
provides the best dyadic approximation, while the continued fraction
coalgebra, provides the best rational approximation. presumably, it can be
derived from the 'norton' coalgebra (contorted fractions), mentioned by
peter johnstone. there are as many redundant coalgebras of reals, as there
are corresponding irredundant ones (one for every interval partition), for
fast outputs.

i think that some of the mentioned *mysteries* about the maps between
these various representations boil down to the fact that they are
coalgebra isomorphisms, that do not preserve the derived structure, but
rather *transform* it. eg, the laplace transform is a coalgebra
isomorphism between the coalgebra of analytic functions and a dual
coalgebra of meromorphic functions --- whereby the convolution ring gets
transformed into a multiplicative domain, etcetc.

in any case, when you are done with reals, you may be interested to have a
look int my paper with martin escardo "calculus in coinductive form",
LICS98, or
ftp://ftp.kestrel.edu/pub/papers/pavlovic/LAPL.ps.gz

all the best,
-- dusko

PS along the lines of peter's bipointed construction (and also to check
whether i understood it):

* bipointed sets are the algebras for the functor 2+(-) :
Set -> Set.

* bipointed sets with two _distinct_ points are the free such algebras. so
lets work in the kleisli category *K* for 2+(-). write 2 = {0,1}

* the bifunctor (-) v (-) : *K* --> *K* maps

    * the objects X, Y to X + {m} + Y
    * the arrows X --f-->2+U and Y--g-->2+V to

        h : X+{m}+Y ---> 2 + U+{m}+V

        h(x) = f(x) if f(x) = 0  or f(x) in U
        h(x) = m if f(x) = 1
        h(M) = m
        h(y) = g(y) if g(y) = 1 or g(y) in V
        h(y) = m if g(y) = 0

* now (0,1) is the final coalgebra for the functor X v X on *K*. the
coalgebra structure

        (0,1) ---> 2+(0,1) +{m}+(0,1)

maps 1/2 to m, x<1/2 to 2x and x>1/2 to 2x-1.

* the finality is now easy to prove directly, by displaying the
anamorphism for any given coalgebra X -r-> 2+X+{m}+X. ditto for the
algebraic structure.

Sorry for the clutter. I forgot a counterexample. Yes, it is
possible for  (X*X)*X  to have a final coalgebra but not  X*X.  On the
discrete category with two objects, A  and  B, let the bifunctor be
defined by:
               * | A  B
               --+------
               A | B  A
               B | A  A

The unique cubical coalgebra is  A  but there is no square coalgebra.

What I don't have is a counterexample with an _associative_ bifunctor.

I am deeply embarrassed at not drawing this inference myself.  I noticed
the felicitous identification of 0111... and 1000... but the importance of
the resulting redundancy didn't click.  That the whole process happened
in one step led me to think that the representation was as irredundant
as all extant one-step constructions.  The fact that addition is easier
to define with Peter's functor than with ours should have been a big hint.

Redundant representations for fast computer arithmetic have been in wide
use since the 1960's.  The Wallace tree, long available in chip form,
leverages the idea to multiply n bit integers with log n circuit delay.
(Chris Wallace is an Australian computer scientist who came up with
this idea while working on Illiac 2 at the University of Illinois.)
The actual multiplication takes half the time, the other half is spent
performing the identification step at the end, namely by putting the
result into canonical form.

All redundant representations of the reals that are or could be used
in computer architecture require a separate step to identify the
redundant representations.  For example Schanuel's recently discussed
almost-additive sequences of integers redundantly represent the reals,
and must be quotiented in order to represent them irredundantly.  By the
same token the group of bounded sequences that I mentioned does the
same, and it too must be quotiented in a separate step, in this case by
a subgroup expressing 2(x/2) = x.

Peter's final coalgebra performs the identification in the same step in
which the reals are created.  I am fairly confident there is no precedent
for such a one-step construction of the reals in which the representation
is redundant.

How about the positive integers with * as sum, with 1->3 as the only
nonidentity arrow?  The unique cubical coalgebra is  1  but there is no
square coalgebra.

I am deeply embarrassed at not drawing this inference myself.  I noticed
the felicitous identification of 0111... and 1000... but the importance of
the resulting redundancy didn't click.  That the whole process happened
in one step led me to think that the representation was as irredundant
as all extant one-step constructions.  The fact that addition is easier
to define with Peter's functor than with ours should have been a big hint.

Redundant representations for fast computer arithmetic have been in wide
use since the 1960's.  The Wallace tree, long available in chip form,
leverages the idea to multiply n bit integers with log n circuit delay.
(Chris Wallace is an Australian computer scientist who came up with
this idea while working on Illiac 2 at the University of Illinois.)
The actual multiplication takes half the time, the other half is spent
performing the identification step at the end, namely by putting the
result into canonical form.

All redundant representations of the reals that are or could be used
in computer architecture require a separate step to identify the
redundant representations.  For example Schanuel's recently discussed
almost-additive sequences of integers redundantly represent the reals,
and must be quotiented in order to represent them irredundantly.  By the
same token the group of bounded sequences that I mentioned does the
same, and it too must be quotiented in a separate step, in this case by
a subgroup expressing 2(x/2) = x.

Peter's final coalgebra performs the identification in the same step in
which the reals are created.  I am fairly confident there is no precedent
for such a one-step construction of the reals in which the representation
is redundant.

Sorry for lagging a few weeks behind in this discussion. Something has
been bothering me about Peter's definition of the midpoint operation
(Dec 26). How can it be coinductive, but the resulting function is not
computable? After mulling it over, I realized that Peter's definition
is *not* coinductive: He gives an equation which has a unique
fixpoint, but it is not a coinductive fixpoint. I believe that Peter's
representation has not enough redundancy to define the algebraic
operations in a purely coinductive manner. Note however that Peter
really only wanted to define the algebraic structure from the final
coalgebra structure on  I = [-1,1];  he did not claim to do it purely
coinductively.

Recall Peter's definition of the midpoint operation (where  h:I-->I  is
the "halfing" map  h(x) = x|0).  I have corrected some typos in lines
4+5:

I think Vaughan has already pointed out that this is not well-defined,
because the four cases in the definition of g are not mutually
disjoint and the right-hand sides do not match; thus let us assume we
write  "dx != T"  instead of  "ux = B",  and similarly for  y.  Note that
the resulting map is neither continuous nor monotone; thus, we are
definitely forced to work with bipointed sets, not posets, for this
construction.

My point is that the definition of  g  is neither recursive nor
co-recursive. The definition of  g  is merely expressed as a fixpoint
equation, and Peter has set up things so that there is indeed a unique
solution to this equation. However, the reason the fixpoint is unique
is because the  "h"  part is contracting, and not because the equation
is co-recursive.

If we write  g  as a pair  <g1, g2>: I x I --> I,  we can separate the
equation for  g  into two equations about  g1  and  g2.  A priori, these two
equations are mutually dependent, but interestingly, it turns out that
they are independent, so we need not worry about simultaneous
fixpoints.  The equation for  g1  can be written as

           s x s                      dist
    I x I -------> (I + I) x (I + I) ------> IxI + IxI + IxI + IxI

      |                                                |
(1)   | g1                                             | pi1 + g1 + g1 + pi1
      |                                                |
                      [h-,h,h,h+]                       
      I  <----------------------------------  I  +  I  +  I  +  I

(add downward arrow heads), where  s: I --> I v I --> I + I  is the
composition of the coalgebra morphism  F  for  I  with one of the two
obvious maps  I v I --> I + I  (the one that sends the midpoint to the
second component, say).  "dist" is distributivity, and  h-  and  h+  are
the maps defined by  h-(x) = x|-1  and  h+(x) = x|1  (these have explicit
definitions similar to that of the halfing map  h).

The equation for  g2  is similar. One obtains it by replacing  pi1
with  pi2.

For this diagram to be considered a co-recursive definition of  g1,  it
would have to be equivalent to a diagram of the form

                    G
    I x I ---------------> (I x I) v (I x I)

      |                            |
(2)   | g1                         | g1 v g1
      |                            |
                    F
      I  --------------------->  I v I

for some suitable coalgebra  G  on  I x I.  This, however, is not the
case, unless (in a suitable sense)  G  is just as complex as  g1  is. For
instance, the first bit (trit?) of  G(x,y)  is the same as that of
g(x,y),  which is the same as the first bit of  midpoint(x,y).  But
the first bit of the midpoint cannot be computed with finite lookahead
(consider  x = 1/3 = +-+-+-...  and  y = -1/3 = -+-+-+...).  Thus, the
first bit of  g  or  G  can't be computed either, and no matter through
how many levels of co-recursion we go, we never arrive at an
elementary function.  Thus, there is no chance of defining the
midpoint operation from elementary functions through a finite chain of
co-recursions.

It ought to be possible to formalize this argument.  Intuitively, note
that in diagram (2),  g1  appears in something like a "tail recursive"
position, whereas in diagram (1) it does not. Thus, if  G  is computable
with finite lookahead (as a function on pairs of streams), and  g1  is
defined like in (2), then  g1  is also computable with finite lookahead:
namely,  G  will tell us the first trit, plus a continuation, and the tail
recursive call will compute the rest. Thus computable functions on
streams are closed under co-recursion (as they should).


Finally, Peter's definition of the midpoint function utilizes the
function  g  and then lifts it through one level of co-recursion. It
is, however, possible, to define the midpoint function directly
without going through this  g:  It is the unique morphism  m: I x I --> I
that makes the following diagram commute:

           s x s                      dist
    I x I -------> (I + I) x (I + I) ------> IxI + IxI + IxI + IxI

      |                                                |
(1)   | m                                              | m + m + m + m
      |                                                |
                      [h-,h,h,h+]                       
      I  <----------------------------------  I  +  I  +  I  +  I.

Or, if you prefer, it is the unique solution of

     m<x,y> = if  dx =  T  and  dy =  T  then  h+ (m<ux,uy>)  else
              if  dx =  T  and  dy != T  then  h  (m<ux,dy>)  else
              if  dx != T  and  dy =  T  then  h  (m<dx,uy>)  else
              if  dx != T  and  dy != T  then  h- (m<dx,dy>)

This definition, of course, is not co-recursive either.  If I am not
mistaken, it is more or less what Vaughan defined in his mail on 
Dec 24, except he separated the case for  dx = T  into two cases 
ux != B  and  (dx=T and ux=B)  (and similarly for  y).

Oops, that gets associativity at the cost of * no longer being a functor
(pointed out to me by Peter Selinger).

Ok, let me dig myself in deeper by making my example more complicated.
Instead of 1->3, put an arrow from i to j whenever i <= j <= 2i.
Now every i is a square coalgebra but no i is a cubical coalgebra.

Now adjoin a new object oo (infinity), with x+oo = oo+x = oo for all x,
and the identity at oo as the only new arrow.  oo is both a square *and*
a cubical coalgebra.  Since it is disconnected from the other square
coalgebras there can't be a final such.  But oo is the only cubical
coalgebra, with only one self-map, making it a final cubical coalgebra.

what exactly do you mean by corecursive? (it's guarded, and guarded equations
do have unique fixpoints.)

Well, maybe not so embarrassed after all.  Although there is some
redundancy, as Peter Selinger pointed out to me (in the same message where
he pointed out the problem with 1->3) there isn't enough redundancy to
make the function constituting Peter F.'s midpoint coalgebra computable,
at least not corecursively.

Given say -++---+-++... and +--+++-+--... (two complementary reals x and
-x, which must therefore sum to zero), if they stay complementary forever
one can output either of +---------... or -+++++++++... forever, with
one output bit per input bit.  These two infinite sequences redundantly
represent zero (as does the empty sequence).  Furthermore if one pictures
oneself as outputting both infinite sequences (justified by the idea that
in the limit they become the same real), then one can discard the "wrong"
one when it is discovered that the two inputs aren't complementary.
Addition defined corecursively in this way is effective.

But while this is computationally appealing, technically speaking it
isn't quite coinduction, which makes no provision for hedging one's bets
by carrying along both possibilities when you can't make up your mind.
To make traditional redundant computer arithmetic work coinductively,
more redundancy is needed.

To that end I tried tripointed sets, calling the constants -,0,+, along
with a functor 3(X) that makes not two but three copies of X and pastes
their constants together as follows:

	-  0  +
	   -  0  +
	      -  0  +
	-------------
	-  .  0  .  +

The idea is that the constants denote -1, 0, and 1 respectively and that
3(I) somehow is isomorphic to I, with the two dots becoming -1/2 and 1/2
respectively.  But for that to work 3(-) would have to paste a lot more
points than it does.

So this seems like a nice question: is there a category C and a functor
F:C->C whose final coalgebra is the continuum with sufficiently redundant
coalgebraic structure to permit addition to be defined coinductively?

I keep forgetting to make a list of what to remember.  Peter Johnstone
kindly put me out of my misery on this noncategory.

Since I don't seem to be having much luck making the example more
complicated, maybe making it simpler might work.

The ring of integers mod 3 is a one-object monoidal category in the
usual way, with multiplication as composition and addition as the monoid.

Every arrow is clearly both a square coalgebra and a cubical coalgebra,
i.e. we have three of each.

Claim: There are no final square coalgebras, but 1 and 2 are final
cubical coalgebras.

Proof.  Square coalgebra homomorphisms f from 2x to x (as square
coalgebras) are those that satisfy xf = (2f)(2x).  But 2x2 = 1 (mod
3) so every f solves this.  Hence there are three square coalgebra
homomorphisms from 2x to x, whence no x is a final square coalgebra.

Cubical coalgebra homomorphisms f from y to x (as cubical coalgebras)
must satisfy xf = (3f)y = 0.  But for x other than 0, f = 0 is the only
solution.  So the two nonzero cubical coalgebras are final.

The same example (unless I've forgottten yet another thing) solves the
corresponding problem for initial algebras.

Indeed, but there's no _final_ cubical coalgebra. What I don't have is
a category with an associative bifunctor with a final cubical
coalgebra but no final square coalgebra.

On a _discrete_ category being the unique coalgebra is necessary and
sufficient for being a final coalgebra. It's easy to see that in a 
semigroup if  x  is a unique solution to  xxx = x  then  x  is the 
unique solution to  xx = x.

After writing all that, I note that in Vaughan's example, *  is not a
functor. If it were, there would have to map from  1*1  to  1*3  and
1*1  would be a square coalgebra.

                        CALL FOR PAPERS

                       LICS'2000 Workshop on

               Chu Spaces: Theory and Applications

          Sunday, June 25, 2000, Santa Barbara, California

              http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/chu.html

A Chu space is a related pair of complementary objects.
Besides having intrinsic interest in their own right, Chu spaces
have found applications to concurrent processes, information flow,
linear logic, proof theory, and universal categories.  The workshop is
concerned with the theory and applications of Chu spaces, as well as
related structures such as the Dialectica construction and double glueing.

The workshop will bring together computer scientists, mathematicians,
logicians, philosophers, and other interested parties to discuss the
development of the subject with regard to its foundations, applications,
prospects, and directions for future work.  Work in the subject is
currently fragmented across several areas: category theory, traditional
model theory, concurrency, and the semantics of programming languages,
and such a workshop can contribute to the coordination and possibly even
some unification of these efforts.

Suggested topics for presentation and discussion include but are by no
means limited to new results about Chu spaces and related structures;
their applications to various areas such as concurrency, games, proof
theory, etc.; and their implications for foundations and philosophy of
computation, mathematics, physics, and other disciplines.

The workshop will be held on Sunday, June 25, 2000 at Santa Barbara,
California, as an adjunct to the International Conference on Logic in
Computer Science (LICS'2000), June 26-29 at the same location as per
http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/libkin/lics/index.html.

Papers within the scope of the workshop are solicited, and may be either
work in progress or more mature work.  Submission should be in the form
of an extended abstract of at most 10 pages, in postscript format, mailed
electronically to paiva@parc.xerox.com.  Submissions will be evaluated
by a committee selected by the organizers, and the full version of
accepted papers will be printed in a proceedings available at the start
of the workshop.

Important dates:

    Extended abstract:          April 25, 2000
    Notification of acceptance: May 15, 2000
    Proceedings version:        June 9, 2000

The workshop will be one full day and is open to all interested
researchers.

The definition I had in mind is that an arrow g is defined from G by
co-recursion "in a single step" if it arises as the unique coalgebra
homomorphism from a coalgebra G to the terminal coalgebra.  It is
defined by co-recusion "in multiple steps" if it is obtained from
certain basic morphisms by repeated applications of the above single
step, together with basic operations on morphisms. I am not so sure
what I mean by "basic"; but I have in mind morphisms and operations
that are defined by ordinary equations (as opposed to fixpoint
equations) from the structure of the category at hand (such as
composition, pairing, the functor "X v Y", etc).

What's the exact definition of "guarded" in this context? I assume
that h x h would be the guard. The fact that Peter's equation has a
unique fixpoint relies on the fact that h x h is contracting. It
follows, for instance, from Banach's fixpoint theorem. If one omits
the "h x h", there are multiple fixpoints.  It seems that the proof
that Peter's equation has a unique fixpoint is independent of the
underlying representation of [0,1], whereas my proposed definition of
"co-recursive" is not.

By the way, Peter's definition of the "halfing" map does not quite fit
my idea of a "basic" map above:

The problem is that "X v Y" is only functorial on morphisms that
preserve top and bottom, and neither T nor B are of that form. Thus it
seems one needs to briefly step outside the category to justify this
particular definition of h.

  Ok, let me dig myself in deeper by making my example more

There's an arrow from  1  to  2  but none from  1*1  to  1*2.  And
when put back in you'll obtain an arrow from  1  to  3.

Even without associativity, if  A  is a  X*X  coalgebra then  A  is

My 'construction' of the reals, referred to by Ross and Mike, was
suggested by an observation of Tate about bilinear maps many years
earlier, but essentially goes back to Eudoxus, who noted that to measure
the ratio of a line segment to another with any desired accuracy, it isn't
necessary to cut either of them up--instead multiply the 'numerator'
segment by a large integer--thus pointing the way to a direct construction
of the reals as ring from the integers as mere additive group.
(Incidentally, I take the task to be relating the continuous to the
discrete, rather than constructing the former from the latter, but never
mind.) R is the ring of endomorphisms E(T(L))of the group T(L) of
translations (rigid maps at finite distance from the identity) of the line
L. If we start instead with a discrete line D (a line of dots), then T(D)
is isomorphic to Z (additive group without preferred generator). E(T(D) is
the ring Z, but instead take A(T(D)), 'almost homomorphisms' (as in Mike's
description) from Z to Z. A(T(D)) is an additive goup with a
'multiplication' by composition, but not a ring, since one distributive
law and commutativity of multiplication fail; but A(T(D)) modulo bounded
maps is R. The maps in both directions are easy: send the real r to the
map 'multiply by r and round down', and send the almost homomorphism f to
the limit of the Cauchy sequence f(n)/n.

Let  S  and  C  be endo-functors that commute, that is, there's a
natural equivalence  c:CS -->  SC.  If  f: F -> SF  is a final

                                       Cf      c_F
coalgebra map from the S-coalgebra  CF --> CSF --> SCF.

Now specialize to the case that  SX  is  X*X  for an associative 
bifunctor and  CX  is  X*X*X.  Indeed, specialize further to the
case that  *  is the ordered-wedge functor so that  F  is the closed
interval, I.  In this special case the induced map  I v I v I  -->  I
is an isomorphism and its inverse makes  I  a final cubical coalgebra.
I don't know a general theorem that specializes to this result.

Clearly  I v I v I  -->  I  can be used to obtain the thirding map
on the interval that I needed for my definition of derivatives. 
And clearly there's nothing special about the number three. We obtain 
a special isomorphism from every iterated ordered-wedge of  I  back
to  I.

In that previous posting on derivatives I wrote:

  Using that the closed interval is the final coalgebra for  X v X v X
  we can define the thirding map  t:I --> I  in a manner similar to 
  (and simpler than) the definition of the halving map.

The problem, of course, was that there was no control on _which_ 
final cubical coalgebra structure was to be used.

Precedence: bulk
Status: O
X-Status: 

I've defined the theory of midpoint algebras to be given by a single
binary operator satisfying the three equations;

            x|x = x                 Idempotence;
            x|y = y|x               Commutativity;
    (u|v)|(x|y) = (u|x)|(v|y)       Middle-two interchange;

and the Horn sentence:

          x|y = x|z  =>  y = z      Cancelation.

For a non-Euclidean example choose a subset of the circle consisting
of an oddly finite number of evenly placed points ("evenly placed"
meaning that the distances between any point and its two immediate
neighbors are the same). For any two points we take their midpoint to
be the unique point that's equally distant from the two of them. I'll
call this a cyclic midpoint algebra. There's one isomorphism type for
each odd natural number. And there aren't too many other finite
midpoint algebras:

1.
    Any non-empty finite midpoint algebra is isomorphic to a 
    product of cyclic midpoint algebras each of prime-power order.

(In particular, there are no finite midpoint algebras of even order.)

A little theorem that I find quite annoying:

2.
    The finite midpoint algebras are semantically complete with 
    respect to the Horn theory. That is, the universally quantified
    first-order Horn sentences on the predicate  x|y = z   that 
    hold for all cyclic midpoint algebras hold for all midpoint 
    algebras.

It's annoying because the finite examples are so unlike the motivating
example of Euclidean space. (Note the perversity: the midpoint of a
pair of adjacent points on a cyclic midpoint algebra is maximally far
from each of them.)

An algebra (for any theory) is said to be torsion-free if the only
finite subalgebras are those with just one element. Torsion freeness
is always given by a Horn theory. For midpoint algebras, torsion 
freeness can be specified with the sequence of Horn sentences of the
form:
          x = y|(y|(y|(...(y|(y|x))...)))   =>   x = y

I little theorem that I don't find at all annoying:

3.
    The real line is semantically complete with respect to the 
    universal quantified first-order theory of torsion-free 
    midpoint algebras.


Because:

1:
Given a non-empty finite midpoint algebra choose an element and label
it  0.  Define the halving function  h  by  hx = 0|x.  The cancelation
condition says that  h  is injective, therefore a permutation. Define
x+y  by  h(x+y) = x|y  and verify the abelian group axioms. The
decomposition theorem for finite abelian groups finishes the proof.

2:
Given an arbitrary non-empty midpoint algebra we may, as observed in
my first post on this subject, choose a  0  and obtain a larger 
algebra in which the halving map becomes an automorphism. (It may be 
explicitly constructed as the set whose elements are named by pairs
<x,n>  where  x  is an element in the given algebra and  n  is a 
natural number; <y,m>  names the same element iff  h^m(x) = h^n(y);
midpoints are defined by  <x,n>|<z,p>  = <h^p(x)|h^n(y),n+p>.) 

Define  x+y  as above to obtain a commutative monoid with the
cancelation property and apply the classical construction to obtain a
larger commutative monoid that is an abelian group. Note that this
group has unique division by two, hence we may view it as a module
over the ring, D, of dyadic rationals.

Given a Horn sentence with a counterexample in some midpoint algebra
we seek a counterexample in a cyclic midpoint algebra. The given
counterexample consists of a finite number of elements. If we embed
their ambient midpoint algebra into a  D-module, we may cut down
to the submodule generated therein by the image of those elements to 
obtain a finitely generated  D-module. One may easily verify that  D
is a principal ideal domain, hence this last  D-module decomposes as a
direct sum of cyclic  D-modules. The indecomposable cyclic modules
correspond to the prime-powers in  D, that is, there are finite cyclic
groups of odd (ordinary) prime power order (each automatically a  
D-module) and one infinite case,  D  itself, viewed as a  D-module.

For the finite set of elements to constitute a counterexample we
need to maintain one given non-equation, hence we can land in a cyclic
D-module. If it happens to be the infinite cyclic  D-module, 
factor out by a principal ideal generated by a sufficiently large
prime integer to maintain the non-equation.

3. 
Given a counterexample to a universally quantified first-order
sentence in a torsion-free midpoint algebra repeat the above
construction to obtain a counterexample in a finite direct sum of
cyclic  D-modules. Verify that it remains a counterexample when we 
factor out the torsion submodule -- that is, verify that the map from
the original torsion-free midpoint algebra remains an embedding. 

We now have a counterexample in a finite direct sum of copies of  D.
Enlarge to a finite direct sum of copies of the rational numbers. One
does not even need the axiom of choice to embed finite-dimensional
rational vector spaces into the one-dimensional real space.

i think such class of corecursive functions would be too narrow: eg, it
seems that only a small part of the elements of the final coalgebra (the
"rationals") can be captured as corecursive constants, at least as long as
your basic operations are finitary. while the class of recursive functions
is countable, the class of corecursive functions should not be, if
constants are to be included.

> What's the exact definition of "guarded" in this context?

in stream and list coalgebra, a fairly obvious semantic condition covers
not only the usual syntactical guard conditions, but also the convergence
criteria for power series solutions of, say, diff eqns. it's in my CMCS98
paper

@article{PavlovicD:GIFC
  author =       "Dusko Pavlovi\'c",
  title =        "Guarded induction on final coalgebras",
  journal =      "E. Notes in Theor. Comp. Sci.",

  volume =       "11",
  url =          "http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs",
}

saying "categorically" which operations are guarded wrt an arbitrary functor is
less straightforward... or at least less easy to justify. i worked on this, but
never managed to get a really convincing formulation. (a clumsy one is on my web
page.)

A Basic Distributive Law
F. Marmolejo, R. Rosebrugh, RJ Wood

We pursue distributive laws between monads, particularly in the context of
KZ-doctrines, and show that a very basic distributive law has
(constructively) completely distributive lattices for its algebras.
Moreover, the resulting monad is shown to be also the double dualization
monad (with respect to the subobject classifier) on ordered sets.

I don't want to be disagreeable, but it seems clear to me that this
construction gives Cauchy reals, not Dedekind reals and only the latter
can be said to go back to Eudoxus.  Indeed, given a nearly function f,
with bound B on the near linearity, it is easy to see that |(fn/n) -
(fm/m)| =< B(1/n + 1/m) so that the sequence fn/n is Cauchy.

                            ---APPSEM'2000---

                  Caminha, Portugal, 9-15 September 2000

            http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/Caminha00/index.html


OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND

Programming languages are the basic tools with which all applications
of computers are built.  It is important, therefore, that they should
be well designed and well implemented. Achieving these goals requires
both a good theoretical understanding of programming language designs,
and practical skills in the development of high quality compilers.

The summer school is addressed to postgraduate students, researchers 
and industrials who want to learn about recent developments in programming 
language research, both in semantic theory and in implementation.

The programme will consist of introductory and advanced courses on the
following themes:  

- description of existing programming language features;

- design of new programming language features;

- implementation and analysis of programming languages;

- transformation and generation of programs;

- verification of programs.

LOCATION

The summer school is located in Caminha, a picturesque village by the 
sea and on the Rio Minho, on the northern border between Portugal and 
Spain.

    Master of Science (MSc) degrees in the Division of Informatics
    at the University of Edinburgh

    The Division of Informatics offers three 1 year courses
    in different topics in Informatics:


        1. MSc in Artificial Intelligence, whose primary focus is on
        development and understanding of intelligent computational processes
        for the benefit of both creating useful artifacts and helping better
        understand intelligence (human or otherwise). The course contains
        five themes: Foundations of AI, Intelligent Robotics, Knowledge-based
        Systems, Natural Language Processing, and Non-Symbolic AI.

        2. MSc in Cognitive Science and Natural Language. This MSc is
        concerned with computational, formal and experimental approaches
        to understanding cognition and natural language. In Cognitive Science,
        the disciplines of formal linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and
        philosophy are brought together in different kinds of computational
        frameworks. This MSc is particularly concerned with how language is
        represented and processed.
     
        3. The MSc in Computer Science contains three themes. The Advanced
        Computer Systems theme embraces the theory and practice of designing
        programmable systems. The Systems Level Integration theme teaches
        the principles underlying the design of integrated software and
        hardware systems in silicon. The Theoretical Computer Science theme
        introduces students to core areas of theoretical Computer Science and
        to the technologies through which theory-based tools are implemented.
    
    Applicants should specify which course(s) they are applying for and
    which themes are of interest in order of priority.
    
    From October to April students attend taught modules.
    During the period May - September inclusive, each student
    undertakes a major practical project, theoretical dissertation or 
    piece of experimental research under the supervision of a
    member of academic staff. The projects can involve industrial 
    collaboration and may be proposed by the student.

    Together, the three courses receive over 40 studentships from the
    UK government, which support about 1/2 of the students on the courses.

    In general, students should have a good BS/BSc degree (or equivalent)
    in an appropriate topic, plus other skills appropriate to the particular
    MSc course.

    About 'disagreeable': As far as I can see, Mike Barr and I don't
disagree. I had trouble figuring out how to post something on the catnet,
so when my original note didn't appear, I added a couple of details and
reposted; I think that the second one was a bit clearer about what I was
crediting to Eudoxus, namely just the idea that cutting the measuring
stick into n equal parts to improve accuracy is unnecessary, and can be
replaced by multiplying the stick one wants to measure by n. (If I'm wrong
in crediting that to Eudoxus, somebody please enlighten me.) Now isn't it
reasonable to say that this simple observation ought to suggest that R can
be constructed without first constructing Q? (The only surprise is that it
doesn't require Z as ring, but only as unordered abelian group.)

    Whether Eudoxus was constructing the Cauchy reals or the Dedekind
reals (or the positive half of those) or 'constructing' anything at
all--which I don't think he was--is irrelevant to the point above, I
think. Of course I agree with Mike that the construction which I based on
E's observation gives the Cauchy reals, as I believe Mike pointed out many
years ago in Montreal when I neglected to make the distinction in a talk I
gave there. He was and is right to make this 'modern' Cauchy versus
Dedekind distinction, and if someone can show me that it isn't modern,
that would be even more interesting!

  Developing Theories of Types and Computability via Realizability

and written under the guidance of Prof. Dana S. Scott at Carnegie Mellon
University is now available at

   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~birkedal/papers.html

(as are a couple of papers related to the thesis). 
The abstract follows below.

Best regards,

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:

We investigate the development of theories of types and computability via
realizability. 

In the first part of the thesis, we suggest a general notion of
realizability, based on weakly closed partial cartesian categories, which
generalizes the usual notion of realizability over a partial combinatory
algebra.  We show how to construct categories of so-called assemblies and
modest sets over any weakly closed partial cartesian category and that
these categories of assemblies and modest sets model dependent predicate
logic, that is, first-order logic over dependent type theory.  We further
characterize when a weakly closed partial cartesian category gives rise to
a topos.  Scott's category of equilogical spaces arises as a special case
of our notion of realizability, namely as modest sets over the category of
algebraic lattices. Thus, as a consequence, we conclude that the category
of equilogical spaces models dependent predicate logic; we include a
concrete description of this model.

In the second part of the thesis, we study a notion of relative
computability, which allows one to consider computable operations operating
on not necessarily computable data.  Given a partial combinatory algebra A,
which we think of as continuous realizers, with a subalgebra A#, which we
think of as computable realizers, there results a realizability topos
RT(A,A#), which one intuitively can think of as having ``continous objects
and computable morphisms''. We study the relationship between this topos
and the standard realizability toposes RT(A) and RT(A#) over A and A#.  In
particular, we show that there is a localic local map of toposes from
RT(A,A#) to RT(A#).  To obtain a better understanding of the relationship
between the internal logics of RT(A,A#) and RT(A#), we then provide a
complete axiomatization of arbitrary local maps of toposes, a new result in
topos theory.  Based on this axiomatization we investigate the relationship
between the internal logics of two toposes connected via a local
map. Moreover, we suggest a modal logic for local maps.  Returning to the
realizability models we show in particular that the modal logic for local
maps in the case of RT(A,A#) and RT(A#) can be seen as a _modal logic for
computability_.  Moreover, we characterize some interesting subcategories
of RT(A,A#) (in much the same way as assemblies and modest sets are
characterized in standard realizability toposes) and show the validity of
some logical principles in RT(A,A#).

        Hotel Terra Nostra, S.Miguel, Azores, Portugal



The Linear TMR research network (http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/LINEAR) is
proud to announce its first International Summer School on Linear
Logic and Applications.

The school lasts one week and comprises both lectures and thematic
sessions directed to young computer scientists and mathematicians
interested in the field of formal logic and its applications.

The lectures are in the tradition of summer schools and cover one
topic, from basic material to more advanced issues. The topics and
lecturers are the following:

      Samson Abramsky --- Game Semantics
      Jean-Yves Girard -- Linear Logic and Ludics
      Stefano Guerrini -- Proof-Nets and Lambda-Calculus
      Yves Lafont ------- Phase Semantics and Decision Problems
      Phil Scott -------- Category Theory and Concrete Models

The thematic sessions will cover state-of-the-art research in Linear
Logic. Each session has an organiser responsible for inviting speakers
who will talk about their work. The themes and organisers are the
following:

      Andrea Asperti ---- Applications
      Vincent Danos ----- Proof Theory
      Thomas Ehrhard ---- Semantics
      Glynn Winskel ----- Concurrency

The school will be held in the island of S.Miguel, Azores, amid
luxurious vegetation and hot water springs. The entrance to the mythic
kingdom of the Atlantis is believed to be located near Hotel Terra
Nostra, some say at the bottom of its famous red and hot water swimming
pool...

Folklore says that Book V of Euclid's Elements is the best extant
approximation to Eudoxus. The Joyce translation:


                          Euclid's Elements
                                      
                                Book V
Definition 5

       Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the
       second and the third to the fourth, when, if any equimultiples
       whatever are taken of the first and third, and any
       equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth, the former
       equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike fall
       short of, the latter equimultiples respectively taken in
       corresponding order.

It looks more Dedekind than Cantor to me (why do people think that
Cauchy had anything to do with this?). But Steve is right when he says
that the rational numbers don't appear: an incommensurable ratio is
described as a partitioning of pairs of integers.

According to Neugebauer the philosophical Greeks avoided the rationals:
they allowed _ratios_ named by pairs of integers, and they effectively
knew how to multiply ratios; but they considered the addition of ratios
as something allowed only by those entirely unphilosophical
calculators to be found in marketplaces.

Objectives

Object-based Distributed Computing is being established as the most
pertinent basis for the support of large, heterogeneous computing and
telecommunications systems. Indeed, several important international
organisations, such as ITU, ISO, OMG, TINA-C, etc. are defining similar
distributed object-based frameworks as a foundation for open distributed
computing.

The advent of Open Object-based Distributed Systems - OODS - brings new
challenges and opportunities for the use and development of formal methods.
New architectures and system models are emerging (e.g., the enterprise,
information, computational and engineering viewpoints of the ITU-T/ISO/IEC
ODP Reference Model) which require formal notational support. Usual design
issues such as specification, verification, refinement, and testing need to
take into account new dimensions introduced by distribution and openness,
such as quality of service and dependability constraints, dynamic binding
and reconfiguration, consistency between multiple models and viewpoints,
etc. OODS is a challenging research context and a source of motivation for
semantical models of object-based systems and notations, for the evolution
of standardised formal description techniques, for the application and
assessment of logic based approaches, for better understanding and
information modeling of business requirements, and for the further
development and use of Object Oriented methodologies and tools.

The objective of FMOODS is to provide an integrated forum for the
presentation of research in several related fields, and the exchange of
ideas and experiences in the topics concerned with the formal methods
support for Open Object-based Distributed Systems.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

   * formal models for object-based distributed computing
   * semantics of object-based distributed systems and programming languages
   * formal techniques in object-based and object-oriented specification,
     analysis and design
   * refinement and transformation of specifications
   * types, service types and subtyping
   * interoperability and composability of distributed services
   * object-based coordination languages
   * object-based mobile languages
   * efficient analysis techniques of specifications
   * multiple viewpoint modelling and consistency between different models
   * formal techniques in distributed systems verification and testing
   * specification, verification and testing of quality of service
     constraints
   * formal methods and object life cycle
   * beyond IDL: semantics based specification patterns
   * formal models for measuring the quality of object-oriented requirement
     or design specifications
   * formal aspects of distributed real-time multimedia systems
   * applications to telecommunications and related areas

Subject: categories: Freyd's couniversal characterization of [0,1]
Sender: cat-dist@mta.ca
Precedence: bulk
Status: RO
X-Status: 


It would be interesting to test Freyd's couniversal characterization
of the unit interval in many other categories.

Here I test it in Top, the category of topological spaces and
continuous maps, and various full subcategories, where one would hope
to get the unit interval with the Euclidean topology.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of the outcome of some tests:

    (1) In Top, the final coalgebra for Freyd's functor exists. Its
underlying object, however, is an indiscrete space (unsurprisingly).

    (2) In the category of T0 spaces, it doesn't exist.

    (3) In the category of normal spaces it does exist, and, as one
would hope, its underlying object is indeed the unit interval with the
Euclidean topology.

See remark below for weakening normality in (3) as much as possible. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arguments follow. 

We work with the category BiTop of bipointed topological spaces, whose
objects are topological spaces with two distinct distinguished points
and whose morphisms are continuous maps that preserve the two
distinguished points.

Given a bipointed topological space x0,x1:1->X, one constructs a
bipointed topological space FX as in the diagram below, where the
square is a pushout.

               inr           x1
        FX <--------- X <---------- 1
        ^             ^
        |             |
    inl |             | x0
        |             |
        X <---------- 1
        ^       x1
        |
     x0 |
        |
        1.

Thus, FX is the quotient of the coproduct of two copies of X that
identifies two points (x1 of the first copy with x0 of the second).
It is clear how F extends to morphisms producing a functor
BiTop->BiTop.

(1)-----------------------------------------------------------------
Is there a final coalgebra d:I->FI in BiTop? In BiSet, Freyd argued,
one can take I=[0,1] with distinguished points 0 and 1 and structure
map d defined by

       d(x) = inl(2x)    if x<=1/2
              inr(2x-1)  if x>=1/2

Notice that for x=1/2 one gets inl(1)=inr(0), as one should.

[[Incidentally, see M.H. Escardo and Th. Streicher. "Induction
and recursion on the partial real line with applications to Real PCF",
TCS 210(1999) 121-157. There, essentially the same definition gives a
final coalgebra whose inverse is an initial algebra, but the
underlying category is that of continuous Scott domains.]]

By general trivial reasons, the same construction works in BiTop if
one endows X with the indiscrete topology: Uniqueness and existence of
a set-theoretic map follow by Freyd's argument, and any map with
values in an indiscrete space is continuous.

(2)------------------------------------------------------------------
Now consider the category of T0 spaces. For the sake of contradiction,
assume that there is a final coalgebra d:X->FX where X has
distinguished points x0 and x1.

Let S be the space with two points 0 and 1 such that {1} is open but
{0} is not (Sierpinski space). We use the facts that 0<=1 in the
specialization order (every neighbourhood of 0 is also a neighbourhood
of 1) and that continuous maps preserve the specialization order.

Let A be S with distinguished points 0 and 1 (in this order). Then FA
has points 0,1/2,1 with distinguished points 0 and 1. So there is a
unique morphism A->FA. By the alleged finality of d:X->FX there is a
unique homomorphism h:A->X. Since h(0)=x_0 and h(1)=x_1, by continuity
of h we conclude that x0<=x1 in the specialization order. By swapping
the order of the distinguished points of S, we also conclude that
x1<=x0. Thus, x0 and x1 have the same neighbourhoods. By the T0
property, they are equal, which contradicts the definition of a
bipointed topological space.

(3)------------------------------------------------------------------
Now consider the category of normal spaces.  We use Urysohn's Lemma
and Banach's Fixed Point Theorem to show that Freyd's construction
works here if one endows I=[0,1] with the Euclidean topology.

First, d:I->FI as defined by above is clearly a homeomorphism with
inverse c:FI->I given by

       c(inl(x))=x/2
       c(inr(x))=(x+1)/2.

(NB. "d" stands for "destructor" and "c" for "constructor".)

Thus, if D:X->FX is a coalgebra, to say that h:X->I is a coalgebra
homomorphism is the same as saying that

	h = c o Fh o D

We thus consider the obvious functional H:C(X,I)->C(X,I) where C(X,I)
is the set of continuous maps from X to I, namely

	H(h) = c o Fh o D.

(I know, the domain and codomain of H should consist of BiTop
morphisms rather than continuous maps; this (co)restriction will be
performed very shortly).

We endow C(X,I) with the sup-metric, which is well-defined as I is
bounded. It is well-known that this is a complete metric space with
limits of Cauchy sequences computed pointwise. We consider the
subspace B(X,I) of BiTop morphisms.  First, it is non-empty by
Urysohn's Lemma. And this is where the assumption of normality is used
(albeit not in its full strength). Second, it is a complete subspace,
as limits are computed pointwise. Third, H trivially (co)restricts to
a functional H:B(X,I)->B(X,I).

Thus, in order to obtain the desired conclusion, all we have to do is
to show that H:B(X,I)->B(X,I) is contractive.

For every x in X, we have that D(x) is of one of the forms inl(y) or
inr(z), for which we respectively get that, for any h in B(X,I),

	H(h)(x)= c o Fh o inl(y)=h(y)/2		or
	H(h)(x)= c o Fh o inr(z)=(h(z)+1)/2.

Hence in each case we respectively get that

       |H(h)(x)-H(g)(x)|=|h(y)/2-g(y)/2|        =|h(y)-g(y)|/2   or
       |H(h)(x)-H(g)(x)|=|(h(z)+1)/2-(g(z)+1)/2|=|h(z)-g(z)|/2

By definition of the sup-metric, the distance from H(h) to H(g) is the
sup of |H(h)(x)-H(g)(x)| over all x. By the above argument this is
smaller than the sup of |h(t)-g(t)|/2 over all t (because the sup of a
larger set is bigger), which is half the distance from h to
g. Therefore H is contractive. Q.E.D

Remark ---------------------------------------------------------------

Normality in (3) can be generalized to the requirement that for any
two distinct points there is a function into the unit interval that
maps one of the points to 0 and the other to 1 (weak normality). This
is stronger than Hausdorffness and weaker than normality by Urysohn's
Lemma.  But this definition uses the very object that we want to
"construct". Does anyone know a characterization of weak normality
that doesn't refer to real numbers? 

It is easy to see that the assumption that the unit interval with the
Freyd's structure is final in BiC for some subcategory C of Top
implies that all spaces of C are weakly normal.

Thus, the largest full subcategory of Top for which the Euclidean unit
interval with Freyd's structure map is a final coalgebra consists
precisely of the weakly normal spaces.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: What does one get in full subcategories of locales and of
equilogical spaces?

In his "Analyse algebrique" (1821), Cauchy gives the first (still informal)
definition of a limit and says (without proof), in order to illustrate the
concept, that an irrational number is the limit of the various rational
sequences approximating it.  He also gives various criteria for
convergence.  Thus, although Cauchy certainly does not give a rigorous and
formal construction of the reels, people ascribe to him the basic idea.
But then, perhaps Bolzano, Weierstrass, Meray and Heine should also be
mentioned, no?

ratios and its relation to modern mathematics', Synthese, 84, 163-211.

Hello All,

I hope you will find the following quote amusing:

    Something great and hard to describe a topos seems to be, 
    for it is a matter and a form simultaneously. 

        Aristotle. Physics (4) 212a

Be warned however that this is the translation to English of the Russian
translation of the Greek original. English translation by 
R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye uses ``place'' in stead of ``topos''.

Nikita.

For reference, the Information for Authors page of Theory and Applications
of categories follows. It has been updated with assistance from Michael
Barr. The TAC style (tac.sty) and class (tac.cls) files have also been
updated, so please replace any copies you may have.

AUTHOR INFORMATION 

Theory and Applications of Categories (TAC) is an all-electronic journal
which uses the TeX typesetting system to define its contents and the
Internet to disseminate them. Authors are invited to submit articles to
any member of the Editorial Board. While any standard flavour of TeX (i.e.
plain, LaTeX, AMS-(La)Tex) may be submitted, the most important request to
an author of a TAC paper is to use one or another version of LaTeX. This
encourages the logical formatting that is described below. Before
submitting an article please read about the Format for submission .

All papers are refereed and acceptance of an article by an Editor
indicates that the high standards of the journal have been met. Articles
may be submitted to only one member of the Board.

The final accepted version of a paper is the form that will be in the
archive; the author will not be able to make any changes, except: errata
and additions can be attached to the end and, where appropriate,
footnote(s) may be added to the main text calling attention to these
addendums; references which mention pre-publication versions may be
updated to final bibliographic form.

Accepted papers will be archived electronically in .dvi and Postscript
format by the journal. In addition, there are several complete mirrors of
the journal's contents on the Internet. A printed paper copy of each
article in the journal is archived in the Mount Allison University
Library.

Authors retain ownership of copyright to their work, subject to
appropriate use of the work by the journal. For details consult the
Copyright Agreement, to which authors must agree before an accepted paper
is published.


FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION: 

SOURCE FILES

TeX source files of articles may be submitted by email to any member of
the Editorial Board. Editors may also provide facilities for receiving
articles by file transfer. Editors will not correct errors in TeX source.
It is the author's responsibility to provide a compilable source file.

The source file for an article must begin with a comment which includes
the following information: the flavour of TeX used, the number of pages,
any diagram macro package used, any non-standard fonts, the implementation
of TeX used in preparation of the article. An example might be


% LaTeX 2.09 document, 12 pp, XY-pic ver 3.1, emTeX version 3.1

An article is normally submitted as a single source file. All macros must
be included with the source file and are the responsibility of the author.
Macros should be placed at the beginning of the file. It is also helpful
if any macro that is not actually used is deleted from the source file.

The only exception to inclusion of macros is diagram macro packages. The
currently acceptable diagram macro packages are those authored by Barr,
Borceux, Rose (XY-Pic) and Taylor. The author is responsible to ensure
that the current version of a macro package has been used.

Articles must include an Abstract, in English of not more than 200 words.
AMS 2000 Subject Classification must also be also be included.

SOURCE FILE STYLE

As indicated above LaTeX is the preferred format. Using LaTeX will
facilitate consideration of an article, but papers in other standard TeX
flavors will be considered.

A style file is available from the journal. Using the style file during
preparation of articles will greatly reduce the acceptance to publication
delay.

Whether or not the journal's style is used, the most important advice for
an author of TAC (or any electronic journal or even any journal that
accepts TeXscripts) is to use logical, rather than physical formatting.
That is, instead of beginning a section by saying


\medskip

\noindent{\bf 4.3 The main theorem.}


just say 


\section{The main theorem}\label{mainth}

(The \label will be explained below.) Instead of saying 


\smallskip
 \noindent{\sc Theorem A}{\it ...}

say 


\begin{theorem}\label{thmA} ... \end{theorem}

(shorter forms as will be explained later). 

You should probably NEVER put explicit skips and kerns into your paper.
Suppose, for example, you want to go on to a new topic and want to leave a
little space. The preferable way is to say


\subsubsection*{}

which will have exactly that effect. But in fact, it is probably always
appropriate to start a new subsection in such a case. Except in very long
papers, we discourage the use of three indexing levels. The point is to
use symbolic formatting and let the journals put in their own style.

All versions of LaTeX provide definitions for \section, \subsection, and
\subsubsection. It even goes further, but these should be enough for
nearly all papers. They do not provide definitions for \begin{theorem} and
the like. But the TAC style files provide a \newtheorem macro that is used
as follows. Place at the beginning of your paper, the following:


\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}
 ... (whatever is needed)

The first parameter is what you will call it in your TeXscript and the
second what it will be called in your paper. So you can just as well say


\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
...

and then you can enclose your theorems in \begin{thm}...\end{thm} or even
\thm...\endthm. Beware that you lose certain error checking with the
latter form.

AVOIDABLE ERRORS

There are two mistakes made by many users of TeX that appear in print over
and over and are easy to avoid. 

The first is to have multicharacter identifiers slanted (like math
symbols), rather than in upright type. This refers to names like sin,
cos,... but also Hom, Tor, Id, ker, Im, .... The TAC style files provide
macros that can automate this. If you put in your file


\mathrmdef{Hom}

this will create a macro \Hom that will put upright Hom into your text. If
you use that instead of just Hom, the results will look much better. Using
just Hom in math mode will result in an italic font and ugly spacing that
is more appropriate to a ternary product. TAC also supplies \mathbfdef
(for bold), and \mathopdef (for upright characters that have a bit of
extra space to the right, so that, say, \sin x will produce the sin, a
small space and then an italic x, just as in the trig books).

The second error is to use <...> for angle brackets. You have no idea how
bad this will look. The < and > produce the wrong shape for angle
brackets, but mainly they produce the wrong spacing and the results can be
ludicrous, especially if an = follows > or precedes <. The official way to
do this is to say \langle and \rangle. Many papers in TAC use these angle
brackets extensively and make little or no use of the inequality signs. If
this is your case, we recommend the following. At the top of your paper,
put:


\mathcode`\<="4268 %left delimiter
\mathcode`\>="5269 %right delimiter
\mathchardef\gt="313E %relation
\mathchardef\lt="313C %relation

The effect of the first two lines is to make < and > into \langle and
\rangle, respectively, so that you can use them freely. The third and
fourth lines allow you to use \lt and \gt for the inequality signs. This
is not done in the TAC styles because an author has the right to use < and
> for the inequalites if desired.

Fonts 

Authors should note that the base font size is 12 point. Avoid use of
elements which depend on another base font size. This is another reason to
avoid absolute moves such as `\vskip 10 pt'. Remember that the journal's
pagination will differ from yours. As a general rule less, but more
logical, formatting is better.

Authors are STRONGLY encouraged to use only fonts from the standard TeX
distribution (cmr etc.), AMS symbol fonts (msym...) or the XY-pic fonts.
They should be aware that use of non-standard fonts can interfere with
successful dissemination of their work. Fonts not mentioned above must be
provided by the author to the Editor concerned and to the journal.

Embedded graphics or Postscript are not currently accepted. 

REFERENCES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY STYLES

When you want to refer to Theorem A (which will not be called that in the
TAC style) of Section 4.3, refer to it as Theorem~\ref{thmA} of
Section~\ref{mainth}. The labels you use are totally arbitrary, of course,
so long as they are not reused in the same paper. Use of symbolic labels
allows you to insert or delete material without having to renumber
everything or to wind up with sections or theorems bis. The ~, by the way,
is an unbreakable space so that the theorem or section number does not get
separated from the word Theorem or Section. This is considered poor style,
although it is not terribly important. It is also an element of good style
to capitalize the words Section and Theorem when followed by an explicit
reference. However, they are not capitalized in such phrases as "next
section" and "the main theorem".

If BiBTeX is used with LaTeX, bibliographies must be BiBTeXed and .bbl
files appended to the source file. No .bib files will be accepted.

References may use the standard BiBTeX styles or the two bibliography
styles that TAC supports. We recommend the first TAC style. It is much
more useful for the reader since it puts citations like [Grothendieck,
1957] in your text (you can probably already guess the reference) and the
reference in the form


\item A. Grothendieck (1957), Quelques points d'algebre homologiques,
T\^ohoku
Math. J. \em{3}, 120-221.

You get the first style by preceding your references with 


\begin{references}

and ending the list of \items with 


\end{references}

The second style is traditional and puts [4] into your paper with the
reference in the traditional form 


\item A. Grothendieck, Quelques points d'algebre homologiques, T\^ohoku
Math. J. \em{3} (1957), 120-221.

To obtain it use 


\begin{references*}

 \item ...

\end{references*}

except you will almost surely want to use \bibitem, allowing you to put in
a symbolic label. 

A FINAL POINT

Although these instructions are specific to TAC, they should go a long way
towards making your papers usable by any journal that is serious about
using author-supplied TeX.

This is interesting in connection with some previous discussion in
this list on "definability" of the mid-point operation "by
coinduction".

As it is well known, the mid-point operation is not continuously
realizable via binary expansions with the Cantor topology. 

(As Andrej Bauer and other people have mentioned signed-digit binary
expansions in this discussion, let me emphasize that, in contrast to
the above situation, all continuous functions [-1,1]^n->[-1,1] are
continuously realizable via signed-digit binary expansions with the
Cantor topology. Put in another way, the space 3^N = (3^N)^n is
projective over (the regular epimorphism) s:3^N->[-1,1], but the space
2^N is not projective over r:2^N->[0,1].)

I can answer this for equilogical spaces.

The functor F: Bi[Equ] ---> Bi[Equ] has a final coalgebra. It
is the equilogical space (C, ~) where C is the Cantor space

        C = 2^N = infinite sequences of 0's and 1's

and ~ is the equivalence relation defined by

        a ~ b  iff  r(a) = r(b)

where r: C --> [0,1] is defined by

        r(a) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k / 2^{k+1}

(This equivalence relation can easily be defined without reference to
the closed interval [0,1].) Thus, the final coalgebra is the
_(unsigned) binary digit representation_ of the closed interval [0,1].
The structure map d: (C,~) ---> F(C,~) is induced by the canonical
isomorphism C ---> C + C = 2 x C.

Unfortunately, this closed interval is not what we would hope for.
Ideally, we would want the _signed_ binary digit representation of
the interval [-1,1], i.e., the space ({-1,0,1}^N, :=:) where :=: is
defined by

        a :=: b  iff  s(a) = s(b)

        s(a) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k / 2^{k+1}

We want this because the real numbers object in Equ is the built from
the _signed_ representation of reals.

I do not see how to adapt the construction so that it yields the
signed representation. We would have to "glue" more than just a couple 
of points. But how do we say what should be glued, without reference
to [0,1] or C?

Let me explain briefly why (C, ~) is the final coalgebra. In Equ, in
the pushout

      1 -------> X
      |          |
      |          |
      |          |
      |          |
      V          V
      X -------> FX

the underlying space of FX is |FX| = |X| + |X|. This is a "small" but
crucial difference between Top and Equ. We can first find the final
coalgebra in Top_0 for the functor A --> A + A, which is the Cantor
space C, and then compute the equivalence relation on C. In this case
it is easy to verify that all the continuous maps obtained from the
coalgebraic structure of C actually preserve the equivalence
relations. By the way, the two distinguished points of (C, ~) are
0^\infty and 1^\infty, of course (and it doesn't matter, since C is
homogeneous).

The following is of course rather unpleasent:

 > underlying object, however, is an indiscrete space (unsurprisingly).

This can be fixed by choosing a slightly different category of
bipointed objects.

Define a *regularly bipointed object* to be an object X with two
distinguished points x0,x1:1->X such that [x0,x1]:1+1->X is regular
mono. Then the terminal coalgebra for Freyd's functor is 1 iff 1+1=1.

With the restriction to regularly bipointed topological spaces, the
statement (1) becomes false because the two-point discrete space 1+1
is not homeomorphically embeded as a subspace of any indiscrete space.
Hopefully, there isn't a final coalgebra in RegBi(Top), but I don't
see any  if there is,
it cannot be the Euclidean interval.

My previous proof of (2) doesn't work with the proposed modification,
but this should still hold. The argument for (3) is undisturbed.

In March 2000, an Abstract State Machine (ASM) Workshop will 
be held at Monte Verita, Switzerland.

The aim of the workshop is to bring together domain-experts 
using ASMs as practical specification formalisms and theore-
ticians using ASMs as formal starting point for their investi-
gations, as well as people generally interested in ASMs.
See http://www.eecs.umich.edu/gasm for more info on ASMs.

The technical program consists of invited lectures, tutorials,
presentations of refereed papers, and software demonstrations. 
A significant part of the time will be devoted to discussions.

Arrival is on Sunday afternoon, June 19th, and the workshop 
program will end on Friday noon, June 24th. A limited number 
of grants covering registration and part of travel costs are 
available for undergraduate students. Applications shall 
include a short CV and resumee of scientific interests.

Monte Verita served for over hundred year as a boiling meeting 
place for a variety of movements, ranging from naturalism, 
over anarchism, to various artistic tendencies. (see 
http://http://www.csf-mv.ethz.ch/Official/MonteVerita/History.html)

The workshop takes place in the newly restored historic 
Bauhaus buildings, situated in a scenic park with a marvelous 
view onto the lake Lago Maggiore and the mountains. A 10 
minutes walk away the participants can take advantage of 
Ascona, a picturesque medieval village on the shore of a 
splendid and sunny bay. (see http://www.ascona.ch/etale.htm)

Ascona and the Monte Verita are situated in the heart of
Europe, easily accessible from Milano, Italy and Zurich, 
Switzerland. For travel instructions see

As a bit of a fun project, I would like to put together a collection of
slogans, and am asking for contributions.  Such a collection may or may not
turn out to be "useful", but at least it will be amusing.

I'm thinking of a slogan (apart from being a Scottish Highland war-cry) as a
pithy little phrase or saying or motto or truism ..., just short of being
poetry, that can tweak the neural pathways to follow a previously traveled
path of understanding.

Slogans tend to be little gems, often found in the folklore, but sometimes
published, such as the 5 slogans in Jim Lambek & P. Scott's "Intro to higher
order categorical logic" - these are:
I: many objects of interest in mathematics congregate in concrete
categories.
II: many objects of interest to mathematicians are themselves small
categories.
III: many objects of interest to mathematicians may be viewed as functors
from small categories to Sets.
IV: many important concepts in mathematics arise as adjoints, right or left,
to previously known functors.
V: many equivalence and duality theorems in mathematics arise as an
equivalence of fixed subcategories induced by a pair of adjoint functors.

I think there are many more such gems; I like (and use) the one that says:
the arrows always go through the limit.
- I attribute this one to Armin Frei circa 1971 at UBC.

Another really good one is: adjoints are the unity and identity of
opposites.
- I attribute this one to Bill Lawvwere

Here are a couple more, from the physics of information:
* there is no information without representation.
* there is no processing without a process.
- attributed to Benjamin Schumacher of Kenyon College.

Each slogan can explode into rich and meaningful ideas, sort of the "url's
of the mind" (if you like that kind of cyber-geek talk).

Anyway, I hope the intention is clear, and that everyone will contribute
their favourites as well.  Please either post a response or send to me
directly (no flames please), along with appropriate credit if known; I will
assemble, and depending on how it goes, make the collection available.

Could be fun and interesting - I look forward to your responses.

Best regards to all .... Al

I am afraid it has not.

In my opinion, it should be called 'semi-simplicial object', consistently
with the original terminology in Eilenberg-Zilber (see references below).
Such a term has been adopted in Weibel's text on homological algebra
(1994). But there seems to be some opposition.
___

I hope the following reconstruction of terminology is correct.

1. What is now called a simplicial object was introduced by Eilenberg and
Zilber (1950); they use:

(a) [already existing] 'simplicial complex' = set with distinguished parts;
(b) [new term] 'semi-simplicial complex' = graded set with faces;
(c) [new term] 'complete s.s. complex' = graded set with faces and degeneracies;

2. Later, notion (c) was recognised as more important than (b) and called
'semi-simplicial complex', leaving (b) without any standard name.

3. Since May's book (1967) at least, notion (c) gradually settled down as
'simplicial set', generalised to 'simplicial object' in a category; this is
now standard.

4. It should now be natural to use a similar term, 'semi-simplicial object
(possibly: set)' for (b), i.e. a 'simplicial object without degeneracies'
(as in Weibel 1994). This is consistent with the original use in
Eilenberg-Zilber and gives a non-ambiguous set of terms for the three
notions recalled:

(a) 'simplicial complex' (also: combinatorial complex)
(b) 'semi-simplicial object (set)'
(c) 'simplicial object (set)'

However, I used myself this terminology in a paper published in '97 and had
strong reactions from people attached to the terminology in use between
50's and '60s (point 2 above).

How do you like:

Higher dimensional algebra supplies algebraic inverses to subdivision, for
application to local-to-global problems. 

(That has been the intention of our programme since the mid-1960's.)

Subject: "Delta sets"

Once upon a time, people doing category theory and algebraic topology
overlapped with people doing geometric topology and algebraic topology.
There is a large literature of $\triangle$-sets, or $\delta$-sets,
which are precisely simplicial sets without degeneracy operations.
I believe the term was introduced in the pair of papers listed in
MathSciNet as "$\triangle$-sets. I II", by Colin Rourke and Brian
Sanderson. Both papers were published in 1971, in the Quarterly
Journal of Mathematics. The main point is that use of delta sets
is essential to the theory of block bundles and thus to PL topology.

Colin Rourke and I called these sets Delta sets. Unfortunately you
might have to look for "$\triangle" to find them. Prior to the two
papers below they were a neglected curiosity. We needed them when
block bundles emerged. I don't know how current the terminology is
now.

... about adding slogans:
"there is no mathematics without structures"
and
"there are no structures without transformations (between structures)"

In stating this, I would go back to (Gauss and) Reimann (and Klein).  
 This was a turning point of last century mathematics.  Geometry is  
the analysis of (possibly) curved space and the unity of geometries  
is found on the notion of transformation (over manifolds, say:  
continuous, differentiable ...).
Mathematics is no more found (only) on "quantities", since ratios of  
length and of angles, at the heart of Euclidean geometry, are not  
preserved in non-euclidean frames (their group of automorphisms are  
not closed under omotheties).

Category Theory is the theory which inherited this fantastic  
broadening of perspective.

Let  I  be a closed interval and let  C(X)  denote the bipointed 
midpoint algebra of continuous functions from a space  X  to  I.
I would not have guessed the following:

1.
   Any map from  C(X)  to  C(Y)  that preserves midpoints, top, and
   bottom is monotonic and preserves constant functions.

The order preservation is an immediate consequence of:

    f =< g   iff  there exists  h  such that  f|top = g|h

If we specialize to the case that  X  and  Y  are single points, the
order preservation implies the only map from  I  to  I  that preserves
midpoints, top and bottom, is the identity map (after first noticing 
that it must have a dense subset of fixed points corresponding to the
dyadic rationals). Let  I -> C(X)  be the "K-map" that assigns 
constant maps. For any  y:Y  let  C(Y) -> I  be its evaluation map.
Then for any map  C(X) -> C(Y)  that preserves midpoints, top, and 
bottom we have that  I -> C(X) -> C(Y) -> I  is the identity map. 
And from that we can easily conclude that  C(X) -> C(Y)  preserves 
constant maps.

In a 22 Dec posting I said that the "mean-value" function  M:C(I) -> I
can be characterized from its order preservation together with what it
does to constant functions and
                                                MxM
         C(I v I) -->  C(I + I) --> C(I) x C(I) ---> I x I
  
        C(F) |                                         | m
             v                                         v         
                                 M
           C(I)  ----------------------------------->  I

where  F:I -> I v I  is the coalgebra structure and  m  is the 
midpoint operation. I went on to say that if  C(F)  is inverted then 
this diagram can be read as a fixed-point definition of  M: "It's the
unique fixed-point of an operator acting on the set of all those 
order-preserving maps from  C(I)  to  R  that do the right thing on 
constant functions." It's much better to change the  R  to  I  and say
just that it's acting on the set of bipointed midpoint-algebra
homomorphisms.

To recapitulate (using  \  for lambda, T  for top, B  for bottom):

2.
    The mean-value operator,  M:C(I) --> I, is the unique map 
    such that:

                   M(\x.B) = B
                   M(\x.T) = T
                 (Mf)|(Mg) = M(\x.(fx)|(gx))
                        Mf = (M(\x.f(B|x)))|(M(\x.f(x|T)))

No inequalities, no limits, only equations.


Let me take the occasion to do a little clean-up. In a 31 Dec posting
I gave a curse-of-analysis proof for:

3.
    Midpoint-preserving functions between intervals are monotonic.

Here's a much better proof. Monotonicity is equivalent to the
preservation of betweenness. Suppose  f  is a midpoint-preserving map 
between intervals. It's conceptually useful to take the target to be, 
instead, the real line and show that a failure to preserve betweenness
forces the values of  f  to be unbounded. So let  a,b,c  be points in 
the source interval with  b  between  a  and  c  which fact will be 
denoted as  {a.b.c}  and suppose that  fb  is not between  fa  and  fc.
Without loss of generality we can assume that  {fa.fc.fb}.  There 
exists  {a.b'.c}  such that either  b = a|b'  or  b = c|b'.  Each of
the equations  fb = fa|fb'  and  fb = fc|fb'  implies   {fa.fc.fb'}.
So  {a.b'.c}  is still an example but the first equation implies that
the distance from  fc  to  fb'  is twice -- and the second equation 
implies it is _at least_ twice -- the distance from  fc  to  fb.  By
iteration we may thus increase that distance beyond any bound.

A point that the previous proof didn't really cover is dispatched
by this corollary:

4.
    Midpoint-preserving functions between intervals are either
    one-to-one or constant.

Suppose  a  and  c  are distinct but  fa = fc.  If there's  c'  such
that  c = a|c'  then we may infer that  fa = fc'.  By replacing  c
with  c'  in this manner as long as possible we may assume that  a  
and  c  are such that there is no solution to the equation  c = a|x 
and from that we may infer that if  c'  is chosen to be the endpoint
such that  {a.c.c'}  then there is  {a,b,c}  such that  c = b|c'. By
the last result we have  fa = fb = fc  hence  fc = fb = fc'.  Thus we
may assume that  a  and  c  are distinct with  fa = fc  and  c  an 
endpoint. Similarly we may assume that  a  is  an endpoint and finish
by applying, once again, the last result.

Besides injectivity we have this corollary on surjectivity obtained
by combining 1 and 3:

5.
    The image of any midpoint preserving function between intervals
    is a closed interval. 

PS

>From the proof of  1  it is clear that order preservation doesn't 
require preservation of bottom. A similar proof uses preservation of
bottom instead of top, but if both conditions are dropped the map 
needn't even be  monotonic. Let  I = [-1,1]  and let  C(I) -> I  be
the map that sends  f  to  f(-1)|(-f1).  It sends all constant 
functions to  0, it sends the identity map to  -1  and it sends the
negating map to  1.)

The proof of  3  suggests that if the target interval is replaced by 
the reals then there do exist midpoint-preserving maps that are not 
monotonic. And that is, indeed, the case in the presence of the axiom
of choice: view the reals as a rational vector-space and count the
number of endomorphisms (each of which preserves midpoints) to find 
that there are  2^{2^N} of them. But there are only  2^N  monotonic
self maps (midpoint preserving or not).

Do we need the axiom of choice? If, instead, we add the axiom of 
measurability, then the counterexamples disappear: let  f  be a 
measurable midpoint-preserving map from  R  to  R;  we can easily
specialize to the case that  f0 = 0, hence  f  is a measurable group
endomorphism; for any real  a  consider the induced group homomorphism
from  R/aZ  to  R/(fa)Z;  any measurable group character is continuous
and that's enough to force  f  to be continuous.

The Logic Team at the Math Department of the University of Ottawa 
announces that it anticipates having one or more openings in its graduate 
program beginning in September. These would be at either the Master's 
or Ph. D. level, and would come with funding in the form of tuition 
and an additional stipend.

The team is run by Phil Scott and Rick Blute, and specializes in the 
following areas:

-linear logic
-categorical logic and proof theory
-category theory, especially monoidal categories
-logic and foundations of computer science 

We have close affiliations with the University of Ottawa School of 
Information Technology and Engineering,  as well as the Category
