Third international workshop on Implicit Computational Complexity-2001 (ICC'01)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   (affiliated with PADO and MFPS)

The Implicit Complexity Workshop (ICC'01) will be held on Sunday, 20
May 2001 in Aarhus as part of the joint PADO/MFPS 2000 conferences.


Topics of Interest:
-------------------

The synergy between Logic, Computational Complexity and Programming
Language Theory has gained importance and vigour in recent years,
cutting across areas such as Proof Theory, Computation Theory,
Applicative Programming, and Philosophical Logic. Several
machine-independent approaches to computational complexity have been
developed, which characterize complexity classes by conceptual
measures borrowed primarily from mathematical logic. Collectively
these approaches might be dubbed IMPLICIT COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY.

Practically, implicit computational complexity provides a framework
for a streamlined incorporation of computational complexity into areas
such as formal methods in software development, programming language
theory. In addition to research reports on theoretical advances in
implicit computational complexity, practical contributions bridging
the gap between Computational Complexity and Programming Language
Theory are therefore of particular interest.

In "Towards a categorical foundation of mathematics" (Logic Colloquium
'95, ed's: J. A. Makowsky and E. V. Ravve, Springer Lecture Notes in Logic
no.11, 1998; pp.153-190) and in subsequent work, I am proposing an
approach to a foundation whose universe consists of the weak n-categories
and whatever things are needed to connect them. This is done on the basis
of a general point of view concerning the role of identity of mathematical
objects. Readers of said paper who have followed developments on weak
higher dimensional categories will note that much has been done since
towards fleshing out the program.

Re-bonjour, 

Thank you for your answers. My question was very general. So here is
the example.

I am going to define the category C and the collection of morphisms S,
with respect to what I would like to localize.

The object of C are the oriented graph. Such an object X is a
topological space obtained by choosing a discrete set X^0 and by
attaching 1-dimensional cells *with orientations*. It is a
1-dimensional CW-complex with oriented arrows.

The morphisms of C are the continuous maps f from X to Y satisfying
this conditions :

1) f(X^0)\subset Y^0

2) f is orientation-preserving

3) f is non-contracting in the sense that a 1-cell is never contracted
to one point.


Remark I : in C, an arrow x--> is not isomorphic to a point.

Remark II : an arrow a-->b can be mapped on the loop a-->a with one 
oriented arrow from a to a.


A morphism f of C is in S if and only if f induces an homeomorphism on
the underlying topological spaces. Now here is an example of f\in S
which is not invertible :

a--->b mapped on a-->x-->b 


This morphism has no inverse in C because the image of x must be equal
to a or b by 1) and therefore one of the arrows would be contracted by
2), which contredicts 3).


I would like to know if C[S^{-1}] exists or no (in the same universe).

The irresistible conjecture is of course that C[S^{-1}] is equivalent
to the category whose objects are that of C and whose morphisms from A
to B are the subset of C^0(A,B) (the set of continuous maps from A to
B) containing all composites of the form
g_1.f_1^{-1}.g_2...g_n.f_n^{-1}.g_{n+1} where g_1,...,g_{n+1}, are
morphisms of C and f_1,...,f_n morphisms in S.

The Ore condition is not satisfied by S because of this example. The
Ore condition says that for any s:A-->B in S, and any f:X-->B, there
exists t:Y-->X in S and g:Y-->A such that s.g=f.t. Now the
counterexample : A is a--->b, B is a-->x-->b with s as above ; X is
a-->x with the inclusion f from X in B. Then necessarily Y=X and t=Id.
And s.g(x)=b and f.t(x)=x.


Thanks in advance. pg.

	Surely we should start with the set of (-1)-categories? <gd&r>

Call the category you describe D.  There is an obvious functor C --> D
which inverts the morphisms of S.  So there is an induced functor
C[S^{-1}] --> D, which is the identity on objects and is clearly full,
since the morphisms from A to B in C[S^{-1}] can be described as the
*formal* composites g_1.f_1^{-1}.....f_n^{-1}.g_{n+1} (modulo certain
relations), where g_1,...,g_{n+1}, are morphisms of C and f_1,...,f_n
morphisms in S.

The question is whether the functor C[S^{-1}] --> D is faithful.

I suspect that this is true in general, but can only prove it if
you restrict yourself to CW-complexes with a finite number of cells.
If you do this, then I believe that the reverse Ore condition holds:
given
        s
     A ---> B
     |
     v
     C

with s in S, there exists

        s
     A ---> B
     |      |
     v      v
     C ---> D
        t

with t in S.  (B is just A with a finite number of vertices added;
just add the images of those points in C as new vertices to get D.)

With this, it isn't hard to see that the functor is faithful.

For infinite CW-complexes, this Ore condition doesn't hold, but I
still suspect that the functor is faithful.  In part it depends upon
what you mean by "orientation preserving".  Does this mean "having a
'positive' derivative at all times"?  Or 'non-negative'?  Or can the
map go forwards and backwards as long as overall it has degree one?

I believe that you are wrong somewhere. The explanation is in 
post-scriptum (borrowed from a question in sci.math.research which 
is not yet posted by now). Or maybe I am wrong in the reasonning ?

I meant 'non-negative'. Maybe the definition of the category still needs 
to be debugged. I don't know. (The motivation of this question was to encode
the notion of 1-dimensional HDA up to dihomotopy for those who know the
subject in a "true" category such that isomorphism classes represent 
1-dimensional HDA up to dihomotopy). "having a 'positive' derivative at 
all times" would be also sufficient I think.


Cheers. pg.


PS : 



The natural conjecture is that C[S^{-1}] is equivalent to the category
D whose objects are that of C and whose morphisms from A to B are the
subset of C^0(A,B) (the set of continuous maps from A to B) containing
all composites of the form g_1.f_1^{-1}.g_2...g_n.f_n^{-1}.g_{n+1}
where g_1,...,g_{n+1} are morphisms of C and f_1,...,f_n morphisms in
S.

If U is a universe containing all sets, let V be a universe with U\in
V. The categorical construction of C[S^{-1}] (let us call it
"C[S^{-1}]") gives a V-small category. "C[S^{-1}]"(A,B) is generally
not a set. To see that, take an object like g_1.f_1^{-1}.g_2 with g_1
and g_2 not invertible in C (this is a reduced form which cannot be
simplified in "C[S^{-1}]"). Then replace f_1^{-1} by

f_1^{-1} \sqcup Id_{codom(f_1^{-1})} \sqcup Id_{codom(f_1^{-1})}
\sqcup...

and g_1 by 

g_1 \sqcup g_1 \sqcup g_1 ...

Then "C[S^{-1}]"(dom(g_2),codom(g_1)) has as many elements as the sets
of U-small cardinals. Therefore "C[S^{-1}]"(dom(g_1),codom(g_2)) is
not a set.

The relation between "C[S^{-1}]" and D is as follows.  There is a
canonical V-small map g : "C[S^{-1}]"(A,B) --> Sets(A,B) and D(A,B) is
the quotient of the V-small set "C[S^{-1}]"(A,B) by the V-small
equivalence relation "x equivalent to y iff g(x)=g(y)".  The above
element of "C[S^{-1}]"(dom(g_2),codom(g_1)) are all of them identified
by this equivalence relation : it is the reason why the homset from
dom(g_2) to codom(g_1) becomes a set.

The obvious functor from C-->D does invert the morphisms of S. But one
has to prove that for any functor C-->E inverting the morphisms of S,
C-->E factorizes through C-->D by a unique functor from D-->E. Such
functor C-->E factorizes through "C[S^{-1}]" but for proving the
factorization through D, one has to prove that E is a sort of concrete
category (a category with a faithful functor to Sets). Of course there
is no reason for E to be concrete but because of the functor F:C-->E,
Im(F) is not too far from a concrete category. C is a concrete
category, constructed with oriented graphs.  I never heard about a
general way of constructing localizations of concrete categories. Does
it exist ?

1a: Sets and categories as mathematical abstractions are equally
disassociated from specific instances.

1b: For almost every interesting known theorem of category theory there
is a harder interesting known theorem of set theory, and vice versa.
It is plausible that the exceptions from set theory outnumber those
from category theory, but it is equally plausible that a majority of
mathematical literates judge category theory harder than set theory.
No clear winner here.

1c: Sets and categories are both ideal entities.

1d: Set theory and category theory are equally factual, and equally
formal.

2: In this sense set theory and category theory are both abstract while
sets and categories are objects and so not abstract.

3a: Set theory and category theory deal equally with the abstract aspects
of their respective subjects.

3b: The FOM mailing list tends to get worked up much more often and
rather more heatedly about the set-vs-category debate than does the
categories mailing list.

4.  Categories lend themselves better to diagrams than do sets.


Conclusions (organized by dictionary meaning of "abstract"):

	1 to 3a: No difference.

	3b:      Category theorists are more abstract than set theorists.

	4:       Sets are more abstract than categories.

The maps you've described all represent the same map in C[S^{-1}].
For example, the diagram

    g_1        f_1           g_2
  A ---> C <---------- D ------------> B
  |      |             |               |
  |1     |             |               |1
  v      v             v               v
    g_1        f_1 v 1       g_2 v g_2
  A ---> C v D <------ D v D --------> B

shows that the top map is equal to the bottom map in C[S^{-1}].

So this doesn't seems to be a counterexample to my guess that 
C[S^{-1}] exists in general.

(By the way, my argument for the case when the CW complexes are
finite, while possibly useful as an idea for how to approach the
general case, is more complicated than is necessary, since with
this assumption C is equivalent to a small category, and so any
localization of C exists.)

I would like to add : I meant 'non-negative' locally. Because one needs that the 
morphism from an arrow a-->b to a loop a-->a exists. The exact definition is : 
morphism of local po-spaces (see "Algebraic topology and concurrency", by

      Surely we should start with the set of (-1)-categories? 

Actually we should start at least a little bit before that, with
(-2)-categories.  Let me explain....

Once upon a time I showed what I called the "periodic table" to
Chris Isham, a physicist who works on quantum gravity.  It starts 
like this:

                   k-tuply monoidal n-categories

              n = 0           n = 1             n = 2

k = 0         sets          categories         2-categories


k = 1        monoids         monoidal           monoidal
                            categories        2-categories

k = 2       commutative      braided            braided
             monoids         monoidal           monoidal
                            categories        2-categories

k = 3         " "           symmetric           sylleptic 
                             monoidal           monoidal 
                            categories        2-categories 

k = 4         " "             " "               symmetric 
                                                monoidal 
                                              2-categories  

k = 5         " "             " "                "  "


and it extends infinitely in both directions.  

The basic idea is that a "k-tuply monoidal n-category" is a weak
(n+k)-category with only one j-morphism for j < k.  There's a
lot of evidence from homotopy theory and elsewhere that each 
column of this table must "stabilize" when k reaches n + 2.  Of 
course, this observation needs to be made more precise before 
it can become a theorem, or even a conjecture, so James Dolan 
and I called it the "stabilization hypothesis".  Carlos Simpson 
found one way to make it precise and prove it:

On the Breen-Baez-Dolan stabilization hypothesis for Tamsamani's 
weak n-categories, math.CT/9810058. 

but everyone who has a definition should take a whack at it!

Anyway, when I showed this pattern to Chris Isham, I was very 
proud of it, so I was annoyed when he instantly found fault with 
it.  He said: what about the (-2)-categories, (-1)-categories, 
and monoidal (-1)-categories?  You've drawn this big triangle, 
but it's missing the upper left-hand corner!  

I told him I'd have to think about that.  

After that, I kept trying to guess what (-2)-categories, 
(-1)-categories and monoidal (-1)-categories should be.  
Clearly a monoidal (-1)-category should be a set with
just one element.  But what about the other two?

Later, when explaining the concepts of "property", "structure" and
"stuff" to Toby Bartels, James Dolan figured out what (-1)-categories
are.  Toby then helped him figure out what (-2)-categories were,
too.  Actually, I should be a bit careful here: they really figured
out what (-1)-groupoids and (-2)-groupoids are.  However, I believe 
that these coincide with (-1)-categories and (-2)-categories.  

I have a lot to do today, and this article is already getting too
long, so I'll stop here and leave these as a puzzle for all of you.
It's sort of fun!

I should however mention this: after James and I came to understand this 
stuff, someone pointed out an error in our definition of n-categories,
and we were very perturbed until we realized it could be fixed by
changing just one number in our existing definition - which would have
been obvious from the start if we'd understood about (-1)-categories.

Fans of the characterization of the real interval as a final coalgebra might
be interested to see the exercise I set the Part III (first year graduate)
students in Cambridge taking this year's Category Theory course.  It's a bit
too cumbersome to reproduce in plain text, but can be found as the last
question on sheet 3 at

http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~leinster/categories

and consists of a guided proof of the fact that the closed real interval is
terminal in a certain category of coalgebras.

I tried to make the exercise as quick and easy as possible, which is why
there is no mention of the wedge product, nor orderings, nor digital
expansions.  I don't know whether this (particularly the omission of the
wedge) is at some cost to understanding.  If anyone has any suggestions as to
how the exercise might be made more transparent then I'd be interested to
hear; I'm aware that there are plenty of people on this list who have a
deeper understanding of this result than I do.

Flagged "highly optional" as it was, no-one as far as I'm aware has actually
tried *doing* this question...

Dear categorists,

in the last week there were some messages about categories of fractions and
the smallness of their hom-sets, set forth by a question of Ph. Gaucher
(Subject: category of fraction and set-theoretic problem; 30 Nov).

I was puzzled by this sentence, in M. Barr's reply (30 Nov):

> ... "But first, I might ask why it matters.  Gabriel-Zisman ignores the
>question and I think they are right to.  Every category is small in
>another universe." ...

The reason why I think it matters should be clear from this example.

U is a universe and Set is the category of U-small sets.
Set has U-small hom-sets and is U-complete (has all limits based on U-small
categories); it is not U-small.
Of course it is V-small for every universe V to which U belongs; but then,
it is not V-complete.

The relevant fact, here, should be:

- to have U-small hom sets and U-small limits for the SAME universe,

i.e., a balance between a property (small hom-sets) which automatically
extends to larger universes and another (small completeness) which
automatically extends the other way, to smaller ones.

Similar balances arise, less trivially, in categories of fractions.
I think that the interest of proving they have small hom-sets (when
possible) is related to other properties of such categories, holding for
the same universe but not in larger ones.

Thus:
HoTop  (the homotopy category of U-small topological spaces)
has U-small hom-sets and U-small products.
(It lacks equalisers; but it has weak equalisers, whence U-small weak limits.)

[HoTop  is the category of fractions of  Top  with respect to homotopy
equivalences.
One proves that it has U-small hom sets by realising it as the quotient of
Top  modulo the homotopy congruence.
U-small products (as well as U-small sums) are inherited from  Top,
because they are "2-products" there, i.e. satisfy the universal property
also for homotopies.
Weak equalisers are provided by homotopy equalisers in  Top.]

My understanding of the relation between  category theory and  set  theory
is that category theory  is a formal theory built on abstract concepts
(objects and morphisms). The way of defining category theory need a
metalanguage which is closed to the logic of set theory language (a
particular case of what is called boolean logic). There is a sort of
dichothomy between logic behind the two theories. This dichothomy come from
our limitation of talking about category theory. We use  already two-valued
logic (true and false)  which we cannot avoid if we need to talk about
identity of objects and morphisms. Now a kind of Godel's arguments about
natural numbers (If N is consistent, then there is no proof of its
consistency by method formalizable within the theory ) is  what is going on.
This doesn't stop the category theory 'game'. When you give birth to a child
you will never know in advance if the child will be an honest person or a
criminal. Category theory have generated many structures which can help us
to understand why many mathematicians have work differently to describe a
same mathematical concept in different ways. As an example we know, from
category theory,  that Cauchy and Dedekind were defining real numbers from
rational numbers but the two definitions are not saying the same thing.

I agree with what Marco Grandis wrote, suggesting that sometimes it is
important to know that the hom sets in a category are small, and want
to just supplement what he said with some examples from topology.  In
topology, one often wants to use a generalized homology or cohomology
theory E to compute something, and it can be useful to "localize" 
a space with respect to this (co)homology theory.  The localization 
X --> L_E X can be characterized as the terminal map from X which
induces an isomorphism under E.  The existence of such localizations
for all X is equivalent to the category Top[(E-isomorphisms)^{-1}]
having small hom sets, and so knowing that the latter is true means
that one has an important tool for practical computations.

The paper by Bousfield

    Bousfield, A. K. 
    The localization of spaces with respect to homology. 
    Topology 14 (1975), 133--150.

is considered quite important because it showed that for any
generalized homology theory E, localizations exist, and these
localizations now play a central role in homotopy theory.  Bousfield
proved the existence by showing that the category of fractions above
has small hom sets.  And he did that by showing that there is a model
structure on the category Top with the E-isomorphisms as the weak
equivalences.

Note that it is still an open question as to whether *co*homological
localizations exist for every cohomology theory E!  Casacuberta,
Scevenels and Jeff Smith have recently shown that they exist if you
assume Vopenka's principle, but if anyone can prove this in general or
show it is independent of ZFC, that would be considered very
interesting.

Operads in Higher-Dimensional Category Theory

Tom Leinster

The purpose of this dissertation is to set up a theory of generalized operads
and multicategories, and to use it as a language in which to propose a
definition of weak omega-category.  This theory of operads and
multicategories has various other applications too: for instance, to the
opetopic approach to n-categories expounded by Baez, Dolan and others, and to
the theory of enrichment of higher-dimensional categorical structures.  We
sketch some of these further developments, without exploring them in full.

We start with a look at bicategories (Chapter 1).  Having reviewed the basics
of the classical definition, we define `unbiased bicategories', in which
n-fold composites of 1-cells are specified for all natural n (rather than the
usual nullary and binary presentation).  We go on to show that the theories
of (classical) bicategories and of unbiased bicategories are equivalent, in a
strong sense.

The heart of this work is the theory of generalized operads and
multicategories.  More exactly, given a monad T on a category E, satisfying
simple conditions, there is a theory of T-operads and T-multicategories. In
Chapter 2 we set up the basic concepts of the theory, including the important
definition of an algebra for a T-multicategory.  In Chapter 3 we cover an
assortment of further operadic topics, some of which are used in later parts
of the thesis, and some of which pertain to the applications mentioned in the
first paragraph.

Chapter 4 is a (proposed) definition of weak omega-category, a modification
of that given by Batanin (Adv Math 136 (1998), 39-103).  Having given the
definition formally, we take a long look at why it is a *reasonable*
definition.  We then explore weak n-categories (for finite n), and show that
weak 2-categories are exactly unbiased bicategories.

The four appendices take care of various details which would have been
distracting in the main text.  Appendix A contains the proof that unbiased
bicategories are essentially the same as classical bicategories.  Appendix B
describes how to form the free T-multicategory on a given T-graph.  In
Appendix C we discuss various facts about strict omega-categories, including
a proof that the category they form is monadic over an appropriate category
of graphs.  Finally, Appendix D is a proof of the existence of an initial
object in a certain category, as required in Chapter 4.

I am confronted with problems of "contradictory terminology" which I would
like to solve and, since english is not my language, I need some
suggestions.
Let  F: Y-----> X be a functor such that for every object  x of  X the comma
category  (x,F) is connected.Such functors, although they are not defined in
all generality, are called "cofinal" in SGA 4 , and "initial" in Borceux's
handbook (Vol.1-§2.11-p.69) but none of these terms is satisfactory.
 The "cofinal" name comes obviously from the vocabulary of ordered sets
which are special cases, but in category theory  "co" is now associated with
dual notions.
The "initial" name is even less satisfactory, because:
(i) If  Y=1, F is identified with an object  x of X and F is "initial" iff x
is a terminal object of X  !
(ii) More generally, if Y has a terminal object  t  then F is "initial" iff 
F(t) is terminal !
(iii) Even more generally yet, without assuming the existence of terminal
objects in Y or X :
 Let X^ and Y^ be the categories of presheaves on X and Y, and  F! :X^----->
Y^  the canonical extension of F to these categories.If  T is the terminal
object of Y^ one can easily show that  F has the previous property iff 
F!(T) is terminal in X^.(Which by the way, gives the nicest proof of the
stability under composition of such functors)
I propose to call these functors either "terminal" or better "final" but I
would like to know if this would not conflict with previous terminology.
Thanks for your help.

Mac Lane calls such functors ``final'' in Categories for the Working
Mathematician. I do too.

There was some discussion of this point on the categories mailing list
a year or two back. I think there was general consensus that the "co"
in "cofinal" was redundant, and that such functors should simply be
called "final". This is the term used in Mac Lane's book (section IX 3,
p.217) -- I believe Mac Lane was the first to shorten "cofinal" to "final".
For some reason, Borceux chose to use the opposite convention regarding
"initial" and "final" in his book (although, in Exercise 2.17.8 on page 94,
he seems to have reverted to the same convention as Mac Lane).

As Steve Lack and Peter Johnstone said, the functors to which Jean Benabou
referred,

> Let  F: Y-----> X be a functor such that for every object  x of  X the comma
> category  (x,F) is connected.Such functors, although they are not defined in

are called "final" in Saunders Mac Lane's famous book.

As Peter also said, there was a lengthy discussion on "categories" in 
July 1998 on this topic, which you can look up in the archive at
        ftp://tac.mta.ca/pub/categories/1998/98-7

The footnote that I wrote on p389 of "Practical Foundations"
        http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/html/s73.html
summing up this discussion reads

> The prefix ``co-'' in the original word cofinal carried the usual
> Latin--English meaning of ``together,'' rather than the meaning of
> dualisation inherited from (co)homology (and maybe trigonometry
> before that).

> Although final functors are the analogue, not the dual, of cofinal
> monotone functions, the prefix was dropped in [Mac Lane, p. 213] as it
> was considered inappropriate.

> I feel that it was unnecessary to introduce this confusion, as
> Proposition 3.2.10 associates them with \emph{co}limits (but cf
> Exercise 3.32).

> Even so, the definitions are not the same: any surjective function
> between discrete posets is cofinal and they give rise to the same
> joins, but to different coproducts.  This difference is attributable
> to the hidden existential quantifier mentioned in the footnote on page 129.

In response to Jean Benabou's question about the terminology for what some
call "cofinal" functors, may I refer him to Section 4.5 of my book "Basic
Concepts of Enriched Category Theory", where such notions are considered
in considerable generality? In so far as we deal with functors - meaning
"V-functors" in the context of V-enriched category theory - the terms I
used, which are those common here at Sydney, are "final functor" and
"initial functor". These notions, however, make sense only when V is
cartesian closed; for a more general symmetric monoidal closed V, what is
said to be initial is a pair (K,x) where K is a V-functor A --> C and x is
a V-natural transformation H --> FK, where H: A --> V and F: C --> V are
V-functors with codomain V, and thus are "weights" for weighted limits.
The 2-cell x expresses F as the left Kan extension of H along K if and
only if, for every V-functor T: C --> B of domain C, the canonical
comparison functor (induced by K and x) between the weighted limits, of
the form

                   (K,x)* : {F,T} ----> {H,TK},
		   
is invertible (either side existing if the other does); the book contains
a third equivalent form making sense whether the limits exist or not. When
these equivalent properties hold, the pair (K,x) is said to be INITIAL.
The point is that, in this case, the F-weighted limit of any T can be
calculated as the H-weighted limit of TK.

When V is cartesian closed, we have for each V-category C the V-functor C
---> V constant at the object 1, limits weighted by which are the CONICAL
limits, which when V = Set are the classical limits. For such a V we can
consider the special case of the situation considered above, where each of
H and F is the functor constant at the object 1, and where x is the unique
2-cell between H and FK; we call the functor K "initial" when this pair
(K,x) is so; equivalently when the canonical lim T ---> lim TK is
invertible for every T (for which one side exists -- or better put in
terms of cones), or equivalently again when

           colim C(K-,c) == 1  for each object c of C.
	  
When V = Set, this is just to say that each comma-category K/c is
connected. When the category C is filtered, a fully-faithful K: A --> C is
final (dual to initial) precisely when each c/K is non-empty.

The book goes on to discuss the Street-Walters factorization of any (ordinary)
functor into an initial one followedby a discrete op-fibration.	

The above being so, it seems that Jean's good taste has led him to suggest
the very same nomenclature that recommended itself to us at Sydney.  I
should have been happier, though, if he had recalled the treatment I gave
lovingly those many years ago. There are many other expositions in the
book that I am equally happy with, and which I am sure Jean would enjoy.
By the way, someone spoke recently on this bulletin board of the book's
being out of print and hard to get; I've been meaning to find the time to
reply to that, and discuss what might be done. The copyright has reverted
to me; but the text does not exist in electronic form - it was written
before TEX existed, and prepared on an IBM typewriter by an excellent
secretary with nine balls.

I suppose I could have some copies - one or more hundreds - printed from
the old master, after correcting the observed typos. But the photocopying
and binding and the postage would cost a bit. I'ld be happy to receive
suggestions, especially from such colleagues as would like to get hold of
a copy. By the way, I sent out preprint copies to about 100 colleagues
back in 1980 or 1981; if any of those are still around, I point out that
they contain the full text. So too do those copies which appeared in the
Hagen Seminarberichte series. Once again, I look forward to any comments,
either in favour of or against making further copies.

Max Kelly.

Hi all,

Ab[C] is just my notation for the category of abelian group objects in
the category C.  I was wondering if there is a simple characterization of
those categories C for which Ab[C] is abelian.

Bill Rowan asks if there is a simple characterization of those
categories  C  for which  Ab[C]  is abelian. I doubt if there can be
a useful necessary and sufficient condition.

A sufficient condition can be found on page 91 of Cats and Alligators,
to wit, that the category be effective regular (where "effective"
means that every equivalence relation is effective,i.e. it appears as
a pullback of a map against itself). Note that the conclusion
(abelian) is self-dual but the condition (effective regular) is not.

I'm pessimistic about a useful necessary and sufficient condition
because of the following: Let  C  be a category with cartesian squares
(needed to define abelian-group-object) such that  Ab[C]  is abelian. 
Let  C' be a full subcategory closed under cartesian squaring that 
contains the image of the forgetful functor from  Ab[C]  back to  C.
Then  Ab[C'] =  Ab[C]. An example of the sort of pathological 
categories to be found among such  C' is the category of all groups in
which the commutator subgroup is a product of a finite number of
simple groups each of which was described prior to 30 June 1973.

Why not get it retyped in TeX (making minor changes - but don't
attempt a serious revision, which would just take time with little
reward towards the project in mind)? - there are bound to be
secretaries who could do that for a reasonable fee.  This would only
be worth it if you can get a "subscription" system to offset that fee
of course.  I do have a copy myself - picked up in a second hand shop
in Cambridge during one of the category meetings there - I think it
was in the late 80's.  That copy has been duplicated several times in
recent years; I think at least one of its offspring has made it back
to Sydney!  So, although I may not buy another copy, I would encourage

I suspect that it is too much to hope for a characterization.  But it is
sufficient that either C or C^op be exact.  For C to be exact, it is
required that it have finite limits, coequalizers of equivalence
relations, that regular epis be stable under pullback and that every
equivalence relation is the kernel pair of its coequalizer.

You can't hope to characterize them: knowing properties of Ab[C] can't
tell you everything about C. For example, if C has a strict terminal object,
then Ab[C] is abelian (because it's degenerate), but that gives you no
information about what else C might contain. If you're looking for a
sufficient condition on C, a canonical one is "Barr-exact" (= effective
regular, in Freyd's terminology): Ab[C] inherits Barr-exactness from C,
and abelian is equivalent to Barr-exact plus additive. Conversely, every
abelian category A is isomorphic to Ab[C] for a suitable Barr-exact C,
namely C = A.

Frank Atanassow emailed me saying that he's "dying to know" the
answer to my puzzle about (-1)-categories and (-2)-categories.  
That's good!  So far the silence has been deafening, and I can't
tell if it indicates bewilderment, lack of interest, or disgust 
with an imprecisely posed question.  

I guess I'll give away the answer.  

As I said, the trick is to figure out what (-1)-groupoids and 
(-2)-groupoids are, and then cross our fingers and hope that 
the answer is the same for (-1)-categories and (-2)-categories.   

We start with the basic principle that people use when trying
to cook up definitions of "weak n-groupoid": weak n-groupoids should
be the same as nice topological spaces of homotopy dimension n.  

Here "nice" means something like a CW complex, and "the same" must
be taken in a suitably n-categorical/homotopical spirit.  But
what does "homotopy dimension n" mean?  

Well, the usual definition is that a space has homotopy dimension n
if all its homotopy groups above the nth are trivial.  But if we 
carefully unpack this, we'll see it's an interesting condition even
when n is -1 or -2.  

Here goes:

A topological space X has homotopy dimension n if given k > n,
any continuous map from the k-sphere to X extends to a continuous
map from the (k+1)-disc to X.

So: X has homotopy dimension 0 if its arc-components have 
vanishing homotopy groups.  If X is nice, this means it's a
disjoint union of contractible spaces, so it's the same as a *set*.  
That's good: 0-groupoids should be sets.   

(See?  I'm using "the same" in a suitably homotopical spirit!
A disjoint union of nice contractible spaces is homotopy equivalent
to a set with the discrete topology.) 

Next: X has homotopy dimension -1 if it has homotopy dimension 
0 and also any continuous map from the 0-sphere to X extends to
a continuous map from the 1-disc to X.  In other words, X is either
empty, or it consists of a single arc-component with vanishing 
homotopy groups.  If X is nice, this means it's the same as a
*set with cardinality 0 or 1*.  So we declare that a (-1)-groupoid
is a set with cardinality 0 or 1.  

Next: X has homotopy dimension -2 if it has homotopy dimension 
-1 and also any continuous map from the (-1)-sphere to X extends
to a continuous map from the 0-disc to X.  The 0-disc is a single
point, and its boundary the (-1)-sphere is the empty set.  So X
must be a *nonempty* space with homotopy dimension -1.   So X
consists of a single arc-component with vanishing homotopy groups.
If X is nice, this means it's the same as a *set with cardinality
1*.  So we declare that a (-2)-groupoid is a set with cardinality 1.

Crossing our fingers, we therefore guess:

A (-1)-category is a set with cardinality 0 or 1.
A (-2)-category is a set with cardinality 1.

This may seem silly, but it's not!  There is a nice relation
between all this business and the notion of "n-stuff".  But I'm 
getting worn out, so instead of explaining that, I'll just quote
some articles that James Dolan and Toby Bartels wrote on 
sci.physics.research when they were first figuring out this "n-stuff" stuff.

Frank also asked if the error in our definition of n-categories 
appears in HDA3.  Yes!  We will correct it in HDA5, which will 
be about Feynman diagrams and "n-stuff".  As I said, it's easy 
to fix: just one number is wrong.

-Ooh, let me guess!
-
-Given a functor U: C -> D, interpret U as a forgetful functor.
-Then C is D with extra *structure* if U is surjective on the
-objects and, given a pair of objects, injective on the
-morphisms between them; and C is D with extra *properties* if

-objects and on the morphisms between a given pair); Otherwise,
-I guess C is just D with extra *stuff* if, given a pair of
-objects, U is injective on the morphisms between them.


here's my classification:

given groupoids c,d and a functor u:c->d, the objects of c can
be thought of via the forgetful functor u as objects of d with
an extra _property_ iff u is full and faithful, as objects of d
with extra _structure_ iff u is faithful, and as objects of d
with extra _stuff_ regardless.

(some category-theoretic jargon:

1.  a "groupoid" is a category where all the morphisms are
invertible.  it may very well be interesting to generalize the
subject matter of this discussion to the case where c and d are
not necessarily groupoids, but to keep things simple for now i
won't do that in this post.

2.  a functor u:c->d is "full" iff for any pair c1,c2 of
objects in c, the map from the hom-set hom(c1,c2) to the
hom-set hom(u(c1),u(c2)) given by u is surjective.

3.  a functor u:c->d is "faithful" iff for any pair c1,c2 of
objects in c, the map from the hom-set hom(c1,c2) to the
hom-set hom(u(c1),u(c2)) given by u is injective.)

one reason i don't (as i think toby was suggesting) require the
forgetful functor u to be surjective on (isomorphism classes
of) objects in order for the objects of c to qualify as objects
of d with extra "structure" is as follows:

consider for example the case where c is the category of rings,
d is the category of groups, and u is the functor assigning to
each ring its underlying additive group.  clearly the objects
of c are objects of d with extra "structure" in the intuitive
sense that i'm trying to capture; we can say that "a ring is
defined to be a group (henceforward referred to as "the
underlying additive group of the ring") equipped with an extra
multiplication operation on it satisfying certain equational
laws...", and although this may sound like the equational laws
only constrain the ring structure on the additive group, they
in fact also implicitly constrain the additive group itself:
it's easy to show that even if you don't explicitly require the
additive group of a ring to be commutative, it will
automatically be forced to be commutative by the other clauses
in the usual definition of "ring" (left and right
distributivity plus multiplicative unit laws, in combination
with the group axioms for addition, should do it, i think).

thus this example is supposed to demonstrate the fact that as
soon as you generally allow yourself to invent a new "type of
structure that an object of d can be equipped with" by starting
with an arbitrary existing such type of structure and
constraining the structures to satisfy some property, it's
awkward to prevent an arbitrary "property that can be
predicated of an object of d" from being considered as a "type
of structure that an object of d can be equipped with" by being
looked at as a constraint on [the degenerate "type of structure
that an object of d can be equipped with" given by "no extra
structure at all"].  thus you should probably broaden your
concept of "type of structure that an object of d can be
equipped with" to include "property that can be predicated of
an object of d" as a special case.

for similar reasons you should probably broaden your concept of
"type of stuff that an object of d can be equipped with" to
include "type of structure that an object of d can be equipped
with" as a special case, if it isn't that broad already.


-For example, the forgetful functor Groups -> Sets shows tha
-groups are sets with extra structure, while the forgetful
-functor Abelian Groups -> Groups shows that Abelian groups are
-groups with extra properties.


i agree with those examples (at least if i interpret them in
accordance with my self-imposed restriction to consider only
the case where all of the morphisms in c and d are invertible).



-Or you can turn around and use
-the free functor Sets -> Groups and say that sets are groups
-with extra properties (to wit, the property of being free).


i disagree with that example, for reasons that hopefully are
clear from my explanations above.  thus i would _not_ say that
a set is a group with the extra property of being free; rather
i'd say that a set is a group with the extra _structure_ of
being equipped with a favored "basis" of mutually free mutual
generators.



-OTOH, the Abelianization functor Groups -> Abelian groups is
-surjective on the objects (and on the morphisms for that
-matter), but groups are not Abelian groups with extra
-structure, because the functor isn't injective on the
-morphisms between a given pair.


i think i agree with this, but it sounds like you're using
my rules here rather than the rules i thought you tried to
spell out in your post.

another example of an object equipped with extra "stuff" would
be a set equipped with another _set_; that is, take c to be
the category of ordered pairs of sets, d to be the category of
sets, and u to be the "projection" functor assigning to an
ordered pair (x,y) of sets its first coordinate x.  i hope
this example helps to show why i consider the terminology
"stuff" reasonably descriptive of the intuition involved.

another example (maybe or maybe not causing some additional
(?) number of people to see this post as having some relevance
to physics) of an object equipped with extra "stuff" rather
than merely with extra "structure" is a manifold equipped with
an unfortunately so-called "spin structure".  the point is
that if we define the concept of "morphism between spin
manifolds" in what seems to me to be the most advantageous
way, then taking c to be the category of spin manifolds, d the
category of manifolds, and u the hopefully obvious forgetful
functor assigning to a spin manifold its underlying ordinary
manifold, u is not faithful.

thus a "spin structure" is not merely "structure"; it's
"stuff".  so what is this extra "stuff"??  you can think of it
as "spin frames" if you want to.  (a "spin frame" is what a
spin manifold has two of where an ordinary manifold has only
one.)  or you can think of it as "spinors"; morphisms between
spin manifolds have an extra discrete degree of freedom to
flip the sign of spinors even after their action on ordinary
manifold points has been completely nailed down.

a deeper understanding of how the classification offered here
arises involves the relationship between groupoid theory and
homotopy theory, as follows:

for any integer n greater than or equal to -1, a space x is
defined to be of "homotopy dimension n" iff for any integer
j strictly greater than n, every continuous map from the
j-dimensional sphere s^j to x is homotopic to a constant map.
using this terminology, every space of homotopy dimension n
is also of homotopy dimension m for any integer m greater than
n.  a crucial fact is that the world of spaces of homotopy
dimension 1 is secretly isomorphic in a very strong way to the
world of groupoids; there's an amazingly perfect "dictionary"
linking concepts from the world of spaces of homotopy
dimension 1 to their secret equivalents in the world of
groupoids.  the groupoid corresponding to a space x of
homotopy dimension 1 is called the "fundamental groupoid" of
x, and the space of homotopy dimension 1 corresponding to a
groupoid g is called the "classifying space" of g.

inside the world of spaces of homotopy dimension 1 are of
course the sub-world of spaces of homotopy dimension 0, and
the sub-sub-world of spaces of homotopy dimension -1.  the
secret equivalent inside the world of groupoids of the
sub-world of spaces of homotopy dimension 0 is the sub-world
of so-called "discrete groupoids", and the secret equivalent
of the sub-sub-world of spaces of homotopy dimension -1 is
the sub-sub-world of just those special discrete groupoids
which have either just one object and one morphism, or no
objects and morphisms at all.

the discrete groupoids are also known as "sets", or
(exploiting the [homotopy dimension 1]/groupoids dictionary)
"groupoids of homotopy dimension 0".  the special discrete
groupoids corresponding to the spaces of homotopy dimension
-1 are called "truth values", or "groupoids of homotopy
dimension -1".  the groupoid with just one object and one
morphism is called "true" (aka "the terminal groupoid" aka
"yes" aka "in") while the empty groupoid is called "false"
(aka "the initial groupoid" aka "no" aka "out").

given a pair c,d of groupoids and a functor u:c->d and an
object d1 in d, we can construct a new groupoid called "the
homotopy fiber of u over d1".  roughly, the homotopy fiber
of u over d1 is the groupoid of "objects of c equipped with
designated isomorphisms from their images under u to d1";
the morphisms in the homotopy fiber are required to preserve
the designated isomorphisms.  as you might guess from the
name "homotopy fiber", the groupoid-theoretic concept of
"homotopy fiber" has a very direct equivalent in homotopy
theory.

we can now re-state the definitions of "property",
"structure", and "stuff" in terms of homotopy dimension of
homotopy fibers, as follows:

given groupoids c,d and a functor u:c->d, the objects of c can
be thought of via the forgetful functor u as objects of d with
an extra _property_ iff the homotopy fibers of u are all of
homotopy dimension -1, as objects of d with extra _structure_
iff the homotopy fibers of u are all of homotopy dimension 0,
and, and as objects of d with extra _stuff_ iff the homotopy
fibers of u are all of homotopy dimension 1.

hopefully this makes the intuition behind the concepts a bit
clearer.  a "property" is something which, if you possess it
at all, then you have no choice in _how_ to possess it, you
just do.  a "structure" is something which if you possess it
then possessing it involves picking a particular structure in
a way analogous to picking an element of a set.  "stuff" is
something which if you possess it then possessing it amounts
to picking some particular stuff in a way analogous to picking
an object of a groupoid.

of course as with most concepts of groupoid theory, the
concepts discussed here should be generalized to the case of
"higher-dimensional groupoid theory" which corresponds to
the homotopy theory of spaces with arbitrary homotopy
dimension in the same way that ordinary groupoid theory
corresponds to the homotopy theory of spaces of homotopy
dimension 1.  thus the stunted progression property,
structure, stuff becomes a genuine open-ended progression:
property, structure, stuff, eka-stuff, eka-eka-stuff, ...  .
thus given arbitrary spaces c,d and a continuous map u:c->d,
we should say that "the objects of the fundamental
infinity-groupoid of c can be thought of via the forgetful
infinity-functor induced by u as objects of the fundamental
infinity-groupoid of d equipped with extra eka^n-stuff" iff
all of the homotopy fibers of u are of homotopy-dimension
n+1.

-You seem to agree with John Baez's classification,
-but he doesn't feel the need to limit to groupoids;
-perhaps a word on how you think that complicates things?

it complicates things in the obvious way: a single concept in groupoid
theory (for example the concept of "faithful functor between
groupoids") may bifurcate into non-equivalent concepts in category
theory (for example the concepts of "faithful functor between
categories" and "functor between categories which is faithful on
isomorphisms"); the necessity of worrying about the distinctions
between such non-equivalent concepts is eliminated by discussing only
the groupoid case.  but presumably you're also asking why it is that
in this tradeoff between simplicity and generality i chose simplicity,
so i'll try to say something about that too.


-Or is it just that groupoids are needed for the deep homotopy connection?

that's part of my motivation by now, but i think my original
motivation had less to do with the "dictionary" that relates groupoid
theory to a special part of homotopy theory than with a different but
in its own way equally powerful "dictionary" relating groupoid theory
to a special kind of predicate logic.  in the world of predicate logic
there's an obvious sense in which adding extra "properties" to the
models of a theory means adding new axioms to the theory, adding extra
"structure" to the models means adding new predicate symbols (possibly
supplemented by new axioms) to the theory, and adding extra "stuff" to
the models means adding new "types" (possibly supplemented by new
predicate symbols and axioms) to the theory.  this
property/structure/stuff distinction in predicate logic matches
perfectly the property/structure/stuff distinction in groupoid theory
if groupoids are interpreted as a certain sort of logical theories in
a certain way.

the more i think about this the more it seems that there should be
some nice big picture that links together the predicate logic aspects
of the situation with the homotopy theory aspects of the situation,
but if so it's a bit too big for me to fully grasp yet so i won't try
to say any more about it at the moment.

i will say though that if someone would show how to generalize the
correspondence between groupoids and logical theories of a certain
sort to a correspondence between categories and logical theories of
some more general sort, then i might be willing to agree that there is
some obvious way of extending the property/structure/stuff
classification of groupoid theory to apply to category theory as well.
i have a vague suspicion that in fact this has already been done and
that the logical theories corresponding to categories differ from the
logical theories corresponding to groupoids more or less precisely in
being "intuitionistic" rather than "classical", but i'm not at all
clear on the details of how this works if it's even correct.


->a deeper understanding of how the classification offered here
->arises involves the relationship between groupoid theory and
->homotopy theory, as follows:
-
->for any integer n greater than or equal to -1, a space x is
->defined to be of "homotopy dimension n" iff for any integer
->j strictly greater than n, every continuous map from the
->j-dimensional sphere s^j to x is homotopic to a constant map.
-
-You can even generalize this to n = -2, noting that s^{-1} is the empty set.

yes, very much so, though i don't think i thought about this until
afterwards.


-Of course, no map from s^{-1} to any space can ever be homotopic to a
-constant, yet there is always some map from s^{-1} to any space (the
-empty map), so no space has homotopy dimension -2, which must be why
-nobody talks about it.

hmm.  first of all, i think i should revise my definition of homotopy
dimension to eliminate the idea of "homotopic to a constant map",
because people seem to disagree on the meaning of "constant map" when
the domain is empty.  (some people think that constantness of maps is
the property of factoring through the one-point set, others think it's
the _structure_ of being equipped with a specific factorization
through the one-point set, and toby apparently thinks it's the
property of having the one-point set as image.)

here's the revised version:

for any integer n greater than or equal to -2, a space x is defined to
be of "homotopy dimension n" iff for every continuous map m from the
[n+1]-dimensional sphere s^[n+1] to x, the space of extensions of m to
the [n+2]-dimensional disk d^[n+2] is contractible.

(here the sphere s^[-1] is defined to be empty, the disk d^[j+1] is
defined to be the mapping cylinder of the map s^j->1, and the sphere
s^[j+1] is defined to be the pushout d^[j+1] +_[s^j] d^[j+1].
"contractible" means equivalent to the 1-point space.)

hopefully with this revised definition it's still true that being of
homotopy dimension n implies being of homotopy dimension n+1.  the
spaces of homotopy dimension -2 are the contractible spaces, and the
spaces of homotopy dimension n for higher n are hopefully just as
before.

the spaces of homotopy dimension n taken from a sufficiently
"convenient" category s of spaces form a cartesian closed category
s_n, and the spaces of homotopy dimension n+1 in s are the spaces
equivalent to classifying spaces of groupoids enriched over s_n.

the class of continuous maps with all homotopy fibers of homotopy
dimension -2 is the class of all homotopy equivalences.  in the world
of groupoids this corresponds to the class of all functors that are
"invertible up to natural isomorphism".  thus eka^[-3]-stuff is
_vacuous_ properties; that is, given groupoids c,d and a functor
f:c->d with f invertible up to natural isomorphism, objects of c can
be thought of as objects of d equipped with a _vacuous_ property.  (as
throughout this discussion, we are interested in everything only "up
to natural isomorphism" or "up to homotopy" in groupoid theory or in
homotopy theory theory respectively.)

notice that the class of all maps with all homotopy fibers of homotopy
dimension n is closed under composition because the homotopy fibers of
a composite map fg are themselves the total spaces of fibrations with
base spaces which are homotopy fibers of g and fibers which are
homotopy fibers of f, and because the class of spaces of homotopy
dimension n is closed under the process of forming a new space as the
total space of a fibration with its base and all its fibers in the
class.

finally, if there's anything such as "spaces of homotopy dimension
-3", i don't want to hear about it.

the correspondence is between individual groupoids and individual
_theories_ of a particular form of predicate logic.  the particular
form of predicate logic involved is pretty much just "the basic" form,
with the allowed syntactic constructions including:


1.  the usual finitary boolean connectives obeying the usual finitary
boolean equational laws

2.  the universal quantifier "for all" (and therefore also the
existential quantifier "for some" via the equivalence between "for
some x, p(x)" and "not (for all x, (not p(x)))")

3.  the built-in binary predicate "equality" with it's usual built-in
reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and substitutability properties


plus one more construction going beyond what's ordinarily considered
"the basic":


4.  the restriction in #1 above against the _infinitary_ boolean
connectives (such as n-fold conjunction for an arbitrary infinite
cardinality n) is lifted.


given a theory t expressed in this kind of logic, we obtain the
groupoid of models of t.  when all the i's are dotted and the t's
crossed in the right way, this process of passing from the theory t to
the groupoid of models of t becomes a "bi-equivalence from the
bi-category of theories to the bi-category of groupoids".

for example, let t be the theory presented by giving no predicate
symbols, plus the one axiom "there are exactly seven things".  (of
course this axiom can be expressed using the allowed syntatic
constructions.)  the groupoid of models of t is the groupoid of
seven-element sets.  this groupoid has just one isomorphism class
because the theory t is "categorical" (in a sense of the word
"categorical" having not much relationship to category theory!).



that's not a complete exposition of the situation, rather just a clue
of the sort i hope you wanted.  i will mention further though that to
develop the full correspondence between theories and groupoids, the
theories should be allowed to be "multi-typed".  if only
"single-typed" theories are considered then the most straightforward
correspondence is not with "abstract" groupoids but rather with
"concrete" groupoids, a "concrete groupoid" being a groupoid equipped
with a faithful functor to the groupoid of sets.  it might be a good
idea to develop the correspondence between single-typed theories and
concrete groupoids before developing the full correspondence between
multi-typed theories and abstract groupoids.  one of the basic lemmas
you should try to understand is as follows:

let x be a set.  let c be the collection of all pairs (s,p) with s a
(possibly infinite) set and p an s-ary relation on x.  let d be the
hyper-collection of all sub-collections of c that are closed under all
of the operations on relations alluded to in #1-#4 above.  then d is
in canonical bijection with the set of subgroups of the group of
permutations of x (taking "permutation" to mean "auto-bijection").

(in the above lemma, among the operations that should count as
"alluded to" is the operation of replacing an s-ary relation by the
obvious corresponding t-ary relation given a bijection from s to t,
even though this operation was perhaps _not_ very explicitly alluded
to.)

I was thinking of suggesting the same myself - I'd be very interested in
subscribing.

All the better if, assuming Max is willing, you can find subscribers public
spirited enough to allow free electronic availability once it's TeXed.
(Perhaps subscribers get a bound copy signed by the author?)

What would it cost?

Can OCR scanning help the initial input for such texts?

Steve Vickers raised the possibility of scanning mathematical text as a
start toward getting it into TeX form.  I thought I would report on my
experience with getting Triples, Toposes and Theories onto the web.  

Some dozens of pages were missing from the original TeX computer file.  I
retyped some of them and I scanned some of them and then turned the special
symbols into TeX notation when the OCR program said it didn't understand.
Scanning works fine and is faster than retyping (for me) if the
mathematical symbolism is not too dense.  Most of the part I had to redo
WAS too dense, and scanning those pages took me about the same length of
time as retyping them.  Michael Barr had retyped the diagrams so they
didn't slow me down. 

If I typed maybe 25% faster than I do scanning would not be worth it except
for things like the introduction and historical notes.  

If you do want to scan, get good software.  I use Omnipage Pro 10.0 which
you can get from 

http://www.caere.com/products/omnipage/pro/ 

for $500, but if you bought a scanner with a free version of Omnipage you
can upgrade for $100.  Do not try to use the free version, it is worth what
it costs.  Academic pricing might be lower.  There are probably other good
scanning programs out there but I don't know anything about them.

As Charles Wells said (embedded in his message),
	scanning would not be worth it

Even translating MicroSoft Word into LaTeX (which I helped other people
to do with Steve Vickers' book "Reasonned Programming") is vastly more
trouble than retyping in LaTeX directly.  (Except perhaps for plain text,
in which case you might as well have used Word to save it in plain text,
or, better, not used Word in the first place.)

In fact I have a recollection of making a resolution that (not only would
I not do such a traslation but that) I would never again help someone with
a LaTeX document that had resulted from such a translation.

Honestly.

When you're pulled all your hair out with the frustration of trying to
do all the necessary incidental corrections,  remember what I said.

Steve Vickers asked by email whether in constructive mathematics a 
(-1)-category should be allowed to be an arbitrary "subsingleton", 
i.e. a set with at most one element.  I think that yes, these should
be allowed - but maybe other things too!

Indeed, a space has homotopy dimension -1 iff 

1) given 2 points in the space there exists a path joining them, 

and 

2) given 2 paths joining them, there exists a path of paths joining *them*

and

3) given 2 paths of paths joining *them*, there exists a path of paths 
  of paths joining THEM, 

and so on ad infinitum.   As a nonconstructivist, I would say that
either the space is empty in which case clause 1) is vacuous, or
it's nonempty in which case we go on and read the resulting infinite
list of clauses.  But a constructive mathematician would have to proceed
differently here, not being allowed to use the excluded middle.  

Do the remaining clauses provide any extra challenges for the constructivist?

Then there's the bit where, having gotten a space that's either empty
or contains one arc-component with vanishing homotopy groups, I conclude
that if it's *nice* (e.g. a CW complex) it's homotopy equivalent to a
space that's either empty or one point.  I don't know how this reasoning
(which uses the Whitehead theorem) gets affected by constructivism.  

Steve's idea sounds interesting, for this reason.  If you plow
through the detailed exchange between James Dolan and Toby Bartels, 
you'll see that (-1)-categories secretly represent TRUTH VALUES.  
In any approach to math where "truth values" are more interesting
than merely 0 or 1, (-1)-categories will be correspondingly more 
interesting than merely sets with 0 or 1 elements.  

I guess this is familiar from topos theory.  But I don't know if 
there's an extra twist due to all the "higher-dimensional" stuff 
going on in my reasoning above.  Are truth values for an
omega-categorical constructivist still more interesting than for
an ordinary constructivist?  The ordinary constructivist may not
know whether two things are equal.  The omega-categorical constructivist
may not know whether all morphisms between two things are related by
a 2-morphism, or whether all such 2-morphisms are related a 3-morphism,
and so on....

Tensor product gives a monoid structure on the class of isomorphism types
of R,R-bimodules, for a ring or ringoid R.  Restricting to those elements
for which there is a two-sided inverse yields a group.  I am inclined to call
this the nonabelian Picard group and denote it by NPic(R).  If we start with
a commutative ring R, then the usual Picard group of R, Pic(R), can be viewed
as an abelian subgroup of NPic(R).

Has anyone seen this before?  Does anyone have some other idea about what this
should be called?

There was a little trap waiting for Mike and me to fall into. We were
seeking conditions on a category  C  that force  Ab[C]  to be abelian
and we came up with the same condition. I wrote, "Note that the 
conclusion (abelian) is self-dual but the condition (effective 
regular) is not." The trouble is: the definition of  Ab[C]  is not
self-dual. I suppose my assertion is true as it stands but the 
implicit message is wrong. Mike had no such luck; he made it explicit:
"[I]t is sufficient that either  C  or  C^op  be exact." (Yes, my 
"effective regular" and Mike's "exact" are equivalent -- it follows 
just from regularity that the pullback of a cover against itself is 
a pushout.)

It took me a while to find a counterexample and I'm not happy with the
one I found. Adjoin to the equational theory of abelian groups a new 
constant and no further axioms. Let  C  be the category of finite 
models. As is the case for the finite models of any equational theory,
C  is effective regular (and Ab[C] is isomorphic to the category of 
finite abelian groups). But  Ab[C^op]  is not abelian. It's empty.
(C^op doesn't have a terminator.)

Sigh!  Peter is, of course, correct.  It actually occurred to me a couple
days after I wrote my reply that Ab[C^op] is not the opposite of Ab[C] but
I never looked into it.

Allow me to express my thanks to the numerous colleagues who have written
during the last couple of days, urging me to re-issue the book and suggesting
ways and means. I have replied in person to a few who have made specific
offers to participate in the process; but I am grateful to all, both for their
useful suggestions and for their encouragement. I shall give more thought to
the possibilities early in the new year.

I have never seen a name for this.  I think, if it hasn't been defined
before, I would be inclined to call it the Morita group.  There is a large
groupoid, let me call it the Morita groupoid, whose objects are rings and
for which a morphism R --> S is a left S, right R bimodule M such that
tensoring with M gives an equivalence between the category of left R
modules and left S modules.  This is locally small since M must be a
finitely generated projective left S module and the group you are dealing
with is simply the group of endomorphisms of R in that groupoid.  the
whole theory is due to Morita (and the main theorem, the Morita theorem).
This is for rings, of course.  I assume that a ringoid is a small
preadditive category.  A preadditive category with finitely many objects
is Morita equivalent to a ring so it will be true for them.  Beyond that,
it would have to be examined because I am not sure what corresponds to
finitely generated.

Here are some thoughts I had on (-2)-categories. When I read John Baez's
posting I thought I had missed the boat, but I guess the point is that
strict n-categories are not the same as weak n-categories (surprise!).

A *strong* n-category (henceforth called n-category) is a category enriched
in (n-1)-Cat, the cartesian closed *category* of small (n-1)-categories.
In the time honoured way, start with the empty category. It's cartesian closed
(it doesn't have a terminal object but let's glance over that). A category 
enriched in it can have no objects, for where would their homs land. So
there is only one, the empty category itself. So the category of small
categories enriched in the empty category is 1, the category with one
morphism, which is cartesian closed of course. A category enriched in 1
is just a class of objects, and a small one is just a set. So now the
category of small categories is just Set, and we are on our way. So 
what's the point? A set is a 0-category, there is only one (-1)-category,
the empty category, and there are no (-2)-categories. There *is* a notion
of (-2)-category, viz. an object of the empty category, but there aren't many
of those! I think it should be clear from this that there is not even a 
notion of (-3)-category so it doesn't even make sense to say there are none.

                C A L L   F O R   P A P E R S

                4th International Workshop on
       Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS2001)

                         Genova, Italy
                         6-7 April 2001

               A satellite workshop of ETAPS 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear
that a great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like
transition systems, automata, process calculi and
class-based systems can be captured uniformly as
coalgebras. Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own
interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various
other fields such as reactive and interactive system theory,
object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system
specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control
systems, category theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of
the workshop is to bring together researchers with a common
interest in the theory of coalgebras and its applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

    * the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
      categorical approaches);
    * coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
      programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
    * coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent)
      programming;
    * coalgebras and data types;
    * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for
      coalgebras (with bisimulations or invariants);
    * coalgebras and algebras;
    * coalgebraic specification and verification;
    * coalgebras and (modal) logic;
    * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event
      and hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent
and ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new
ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in
Lisbon, Amsterdam and Berlin. The proceedings appeared as
ENTCS Vols. 11,19 and 33.

------------------------------------------------------------

Location

CMCS2001 will be held in Genova on 6-7 April 2001, just
after ETAPS2001 (European Joint Conferences on Theory and
Practice of Software).
