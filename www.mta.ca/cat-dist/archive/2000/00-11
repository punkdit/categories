It is folklore that the method of generators and relations works for any
essentially algebraic theory with finitary operators, as well as for some
more general ones. "Algebraic" means defined by operators and equational
laws (could be many-sorted); "essentially" means that the operators may be
partial, with their domains of definition described by finite sets of
equations.

The way the method works is that from the presentation by generators and
relations one can derive a universal property of the desired algebra, so the
problem is whether an algebra does indeed exist with that property. If it
does, then it is unique up to isomorphism.

The theory of categories is essentially algebraic, so generators and
relations for a category do present a category.

I wish I knew of an introductory text describing the techniques at this
level of generality, but unfortunately I'm not aware of any - maybe somebody
can suggest one. Manes's book "Algebraic Theories" is quite good on the
algebraic case.

Here's a sketch of a formal system.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Terms are of two sorts: object and arrow.

Term formation is by function symbols s, t, i and c, with the obvious
arities, for source, target, identity and composition. (Note at this level
that a term exists for the composite of any two arrows, regardless of
whether they are composable.)

Equality of terms is symmetric and transitive, but _not_ reflexive.

Rules include the following (x and y are objects, f and g are arrows).

  f=g |- s(f)=s(g)
  f=g |- t(f)=t(g)
  x=y |- i(x)=i(y)
  f1=f2, g1=g2, t(f1)=s(g1), t(f2)=s(g2) |- c(f1,g1)=c(f2,g2)

Also rules for the usual equational laws of category theory (associativity
etc.), and

  |- u=u    for each generator u (object or arrow)
  |- r        for each equational relation r

The category is then got by taking all terms z for which z=z, modulo
equality.

On "generators":
Given a graph (set of objects and set of (formal) arrows between objects),
the original objects together with the finite *paths* (f,g,h,...,k) in 
this graph (as morphisms) constitute a category (called 
the "free category on this graph"):
    - identities are the empty paths;
    - composition is concatenation of paths.

On "relations":
Given a category and a relation R on its arrows (i.e. a subset of A x A)
relating only arrows with the same domain and codomain, let R' be the
smallest congruence relation containing R.
  [A congruence relation S is an equivalence relation (i.e. S is 
   reflexive, symmetric and transitive) that moreover 
   is closed under composition: aSb and cSd imply (a.c)S(b.d).]
  [Check that the " *smallest* congruence relation containing R " 
   is a well-defined notion, as the class of congruence relations containing R
   is closed under arbitrary intersections. So the intersection of those
   congruence relations containing R is also a congruence relation 
   containing R, indeed the smallest one.]
Now the original objects together with the congruence classes [f] of R' 
(as morphisms) constitute a category (called the quotient category):
    - identities are the classes of the identities [1];
    - the composite [f].[g] is by definition [f.g], which is well-defined.

There is a more explicit/constructive description of R' in terms of R.
Consider the following relation:
aR"b  iff  there exist n \geq 0 and an n-chain: 
           (n+1) morphisms  a_0, a_1, ..., a_n such that
              a = a_0;  
              a_n = b;  
              for all 0 \leq i < n there are morphisms u,v,c,d such that
                 a_i = u.c.v and a_{i+1} = u.d.v  and  either cRd  or  dRc
This clearly is a congruence relation containing R, whence R' \subseteq R".
The other way around, you show by induction on n that every n-chain is
between R'-congruent formulas. Hence R' = R".

There is much more to say about presentations in general, but I hope the
above details for categories answer your questions. 
Let me briefly return to your specific example:

> E.g. "Example 15. Consider
> the category presented by one object A, one arrow e:A->A, and the
> one relation e.e.e.e = 1subA. From this, he deduces by hand the
> category has additional arrows e .e, e.e.e. I have two questions:

Observe that the free category on this graph (one object, one arrow)
has infinitely many arrows:  (); (e); (e,e); (e,e,e); (e,e,e,e); ...
Let us denote them by e^0, e^1, e^2, e^3, e^4, ... 
Recall that these arrows are actually the paths in the graph, and 
that they are all different!
According to your example R = { (e^4,e^0) }.
Check that R' = R" = { (e^n,e^m) | n-m is a 4-fold }.
Check that there are only four congruence classes in the quotient
category: [e^0], [e^1], [e^2], [e^3].
An example of a composite: [e^2].[e^3] = [e^2.e^3] = [e^5] = [e^1].

You do not deduce additional arrows; the arrows are the original paths.
R' can be described by the following deductive system:
  axioms: the instances of R and reflexivity;
  rules:  symmetry, transitivity, closure.

> 2) Given generators and relations are we guaranteed to get a category?

Yes, since we agreed upon considering the smallest congruence relation 
containing your relations.

Consider the following situation:

           R |- F |- L   with F o R = id and F o L = id.

I have derived a number of results about this situation, but probably this
is already known in the literature? Under the name `Lawvere cylinders'?

First Announcement: 

  Conference on Algebraic Topological Methods in Computer Science

Department of Mathematics
Stanford University

July 30 - August 3, 2001

The application of algebraic topological methods in areas related to
Computer Science is an emerging field that is of interest to both pure
and applied mathematical scientists. The aim of this conference is to
describe recent advances, and define the fundamental open problems
in the field through a mixture of expository and technical lectures.  There
will be twenty lectures, on a variety of topics in the area.

The following is a preliminary list of invited speakers:

John Baez (Math, UC Riverside)
Marshall Bern (Xerox PARC)
Tamal Dey (CS, Ohio State)
Herbert Edelsbrunner (CS, Duke)
David Eppstein (CS, UC Irvine)

I would be happy to learn the results which Till Mossakowski has found
concerning those situations involving an Adjoint Unity and Identity of
Opposites as I discussed in my "Unity and Identity of Opposites in
Calculus and Physics",in Applied Categorical Structures vol.4, 167-174,
1996. 

Two parallel functors are adjointly opposite if they are full and
faithful and if there is a third functor left adjoint to one and right
adjoint to the other; the two subcategories are opposite as such but
identical if one neglects the inclusions.

A simple example which I recently noted is even vs odd. That is, taking
both the top category and the smaller category to be the poset of
natural numbers, let L(n)=2n but R(n)=2n+1. Then the required middle
functor exists; a surprising formula for it can be found by solving a
third-order linear difference equation.

I hope that Till Mossakowski's results may help to compute some other
number-theoretic functions that arise by confronting Hegel's Aufhebung
idea (or one mathematical version of it) with multi-dimensional
combinatorial topology. Consider the set of all such AUIO situations
within a fixed top category. This set of "levels" is obviously ordered by
any of the three equivalent conditions :
         L1  belongs to L2, R1 belongs to R2, F2 depends on F1.
(Here "belongs" and "depends" just mean the existence of
factorizations, but in dual senses). However there is also the stronger
relation that
         L1 might belong to R2;     
for a given level, there may be a smallest higher level which is strongly
higher in that sense, and if so it may be called the Aufhebung of the
given level.

In case the given containing category is such that the set of all 
levels is isomorphic to the natural numbers with infinity (the top) and
minus infinity (the initial object=L and terminal object=R), then the
Aufhebung exists, but the specific function depends on the category.
Mike Roy in his 1997 U. of Buffalo thesis studied the topos of ball
complexes, finding in particular that both Aufhebung and coAufhebung exist
and that they are both equal to the successor function on dimensions. 

Still not calculated is that function for the topos of presheaves on the 
category of nonempty finite sets. This category is important logically
because the presheaf represented by 2 is generic among all Boolean algebra
objects in all toposes defined over the same base topos of sets, and
topologically because of its close relation with classical simplicial
complexes.  Here the levels or dimensions just correspond to those
subcategories of finite sets  that are closed under retract. It is easy to
see that the Aufhebung of dimension 0 (the one point set) is dimension 1 
(the two-point set and its retracts), but what is the general formula ?

In the same way an induction principle is expressible by means of a
least fixed point, one could expect coinductive principles to be
expressible by means of greatest fixed points.

The following example will clarify what I have in mind.
Let G,H two graphs, then we can construct the graph G*H, where 

(G*H)_0 = G_0 x H_0 

and 

(G*H)_1 = (G_1 x H_0) + (G_0 x H_1) . 

Every transition of  G*H is labeled: it is either a left transition or a
right transition. We obtain in this way two modal operators on the
subsets of G_0 x H_0, call them <l> and <r>. A bisimulation is a subset
B of G_0 x H_0 such that

B <= [r]<l>B and B <= [l]<r> , 

where the [] are the duals of <>. If G = H, then saying that G has no
proper quotient amounts to saying that the greatest bisimulation is
equal to the diagonal D. Therefore a principle of coinduction can be
expressed as follows:

\nu_z.([r]<l>z \wedge [l]<r>z) = D 

where \nu_z.f(z) is the greatest fixed point of f(z). The example can be
generalized. 

The following question arises: is the greatest postfixed point definable
equationally? The answer is yes, at least in several cases, as it is the
least prefixed point.

Consider a theory which contains the signature <0,+,.,\>. <0,+> satisfy
the semilattice axioms and, with respect to induced order, a.x is left
adjoint to a\x, for a fixed a. Let f(z) be any term of the theory, then
the following holds:

g(x) is the parameterized least prefixed point of f(z).x if and only if
the equations

f(g(x)).x = g(x)
g(x) <= g(x+y)
g(f(x)\x) <= x

hold. 

It is an easy exercise to check this is true, using the fact that
f(x).(f(x)\x) <= x . If . has a right unit 1, then g(1) is the least
prefixed point of f(z). Similar results hold for the greatest postfixed
point if we can find an operation . with a parameterized right adjoint. 

Algebraic models of the propositional $\mu$-calculus form a variety, as
the models of PDL do, and hopefully coinductive principles can be
expressed. One could also define something like a $\mu$-linear logic,
its models would form a variety. 

Best regards,

	Luigi

In this discussion of adjoint cylinders, I haven't noticed anyone
pointing out that when L --| F --| R, then FL = Id (I use = for natural
equivalence here) iff FR = Id.  Dusko told me earlier this year that it
was in his thesis, but I would not be surprised if it were older than
that.  Here is a simple proof.  Let eta:  Id --> FL be the inner
adjunction of L --| F and epsilon:  FR --> Id be the outer adjunction of
F --| R. Then if alpha F means apply F,the composites

           alpha F              Hom(eta-,F-)
 Hom(L-,-) -------> Hom(FL-,F-) ------------> Hom(-,F-)

           alpha F              Hom(F-,epsilon-)
 Hom(-,R-) -------> Hom(F-,FR-) ----------------> Hom(F-,-)

are isomorphisms.  Then there is a commutative square (both composites
are Hom(eta-,epsilon -) o alpha F):

                        Hom(eta-,FR-) o alpha F
             Hom(L-,R-) ------------------------> Hom(-,FR-)
                 |                                    |
                 |                                    |
                 |                                    |
                 |                                    |
  Hom(FL-,epsilon-) o alpha F                  Hom(-,epsilon-)
                 |                                    |
                 |                                    |
                 |                                    |
                 v           Hom(eta,-)               v
             Hom(FL,-) -------------------------> Hom(-,-)

in which the upper and left hand maps are isomorphisms and it follows
that the bottom arrow is an isomorphism iff the right hand one is.

Here is an even simpler one: FL is left adjoint to FR, by composability 
of adjoints; the identity functor is left adjoint to itself.

I had an idea and I'd like to know whether you like it and some advice on
making it work if you do. 


There are quite a few interesting tales about category theorists around. I
think it will be a shame to lose this more human history as time passes
and us newer category theorists can't completely remember the stories....
So I'd like to set up a kind of archive - a sort of myths and legends of
the category theorists (but preferably more truth than myth!).

This is the plan so far (assuming you think this is not a terrible idea).

Format:
An email-style archive with tales/histories/mini-biographies submitted by
email in plain text and linked to from a page of titles (titles would
include rough dates, authors and characters - which would make it easily
searchable so you can easily read about your particular heroes!).

Procedure:
Email sent to me which would have to be accepted by every living character
in the story (for obvious reasons). Some procedure should be agreed for
the acceptance of stories about people no longer alive.
The best stories, I guess, will be those people write about themselves.

This is just an idea, I hope you will let me know whether you approve.

--Anne.

                  ESSLLI 2001 STUDENT SESSION

                     FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

              August 13-24 2001, Helsinki, Finland

                   Deadline: February 18, 2001

             http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/~kris/esslli

We are pleased to announce the Student Session of the 13th European
Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI 2001)
organized by the University of Helsinki under the auspices of the
European Association for Logic, Language and Information
(FoLLI). ESSLLI 2001 will be held at the University of Helsinki in
August 2001. We invite submission of papers for presentation at the
ESSLLI 2001 Student Session and for appearance in the proceedings.

PURPOSE:
This sixth ESSLLI Student Session will provide, like the other
editions, an opportunity for ESSLLI participants who are students to
present their own work in progress and get feedback from senior
researchers and fellow-students.  The ESSLLI Student Session
encourages submissions from students at any level, from undergraduates
(before completion of the Master Thesis) as well as postgraduates
(before completion of the PhD degree). Papers co-authored by
non-students will not be accepted.  Papers may be accepted for full
presentation (30 minutes including 10 minutes of discussion) or for a
poster presentation.  The accepted papers will be published in the
ESSLLI 2001 Student Session proceedings, which will be made available
during the summer school.

KLUWER BEST PAPER AWARD: 
As in previous years, the best paper will be selected by the program
committee and will be offered a prize by Kluwer Academic Publishers
consisting in 1000 Dfl worth of books.


REQUIREMENTS: 
The Student Session papers should describe original, unpublished work,
completed or in progress that demonstrates insight, creativity, and
promise. No previously published papers should be submitted. All
topics within the six ESSLLI subject areas (Logic, Language,
Computation, Logic & Language, Logic & Computation, Language &
Computation) are of interest.


FORMAT OF SUBMISSION:
Student authors should submit an anonymous extended abstract headed by
the paper title, not to exceed 5 pages in length exclusive of
references and send a separate identification page (see below). Note
that the length of the full papers will not be allowed to exceed 10
pages. Since reviewing will be blind, the body of the abstract should
omit author names and addresses. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity (e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,
1991)... ") should be avoided. It is possible to use instead
references like "Smith (1991) previously showed...".  For any
submission, a plain ASCII text version of the identification page
should be sent separately, using the following format:

Title: title of the submission 
First author: firstname lastname
Address: address of the first author 
...... 
Last author: firstname lastname 
Address: address of the last author 
Short summary: abstract (5 lines) 
Subject area (one of): Logic | Language | Computation | Logic and
Language | Logic and Computation | Language and Computation

If necessary, the program committee may reassign papers to a more
appropriate subject area. The submission of the extended abstract
should be in one of the following formats: PostScript, PDF, RTF, or
plain text. But note that, in case of acceptance, the final version of
the paper has to be submitted in LaTeX format. Please, use A4 size
pages, 11pt or 12pt fonts, and standard margins. Submissions outside
the specified length and formatting requirements may be subject to
rejection without review.

The extended abstract and separate identification page must be sent by
e-mail to:

kris@coli.uni-sb.de by FEBRUARY 18, 2001

     The book 

	DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICS 1950-2000

edited by Jean-Paul Pier, and published by Birkhaeuser, recently
appeared.  It has many good articles on the mathematics of the
stated period.  Of course, the subjects were limited by space and
the choices made by the editorial board.  In particular, categories,
homological algebra, etc. are not treated in separate articles.
My own paper
       Comments on the Development of Topos Theory
       pp 715 - 724
is rather compressed, due to space limitations.  There are no doubt
many significant aspects which I was not able to include.  The present
forum would perhaps be a good place to point those out.

    My article

	Comments on the Development of Topos Theory

is not AS compressed as my misprint suggested; it is on

			 pp 715 -734

of J.P. Pier's new book

        DEVELOPMENT OF MATHEMATICS 1950 - 2000

Nonetheless, there are doubtless many aspects which are under-represented
in those pages.  I hope that these aspects will be elaborated here on the
categories net.

Post-Doctoral Research Assistant: Digital Topology and Geometry

Applications are invited for a Post Doctoral Research Assistant
at The University of Leeds to work on an EPSRC funded project
"Digital Topology and Geometry: An Axiomatic Approach, with Applications 
to GIS and Spatial Reasoning". This is a joint project with Imperial
College,
London, where the Principal Investigator is Dr Mike Smyth.

The post will be based at the School of Computing, University of Leeds,
where there is a well-established research group in spatial reasoning.
There will be close collaboration with researchers at Imperial College,
and also with the Geographic Information Systems research group at
Keele University.

The post is available from 1st January 2001, but it may be possible to
agree
a slightly later starting date. The appointment is for a fixed term
of three years.

The principal aims of the project are

1. To develop an axiomatic theory of geometry that admits as models
discrete
   spaces as well as classical continuos spaces such as Euclidean
spaces.

2. To produce topological and geometric structures which can be used as
the
   basis of computational descriptions of natural phenomena.
Applications in
   the areas of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial reasoning
in
   artificial inteligence (AI) will be investigated.

3. To extend digital topology as used in image analysis to a theory of
digital
   geometry.

4. To design and implement algorithms within the developed digital
geometry
   for tasks such as convex hull and Delauny triangulation.

The research assistant will work largely on the applications of the
geometric
theory including the development of algorithms and the evaluation of the
suitablility of the theory to problems in areas such as spatial
reasoning in AI,
GIS and image analysis. One phase of the project will focus on
applications to
multi-resolution spatial data: the description of geometric structure at
a variety
of levels of detail.

Candidates should have, or be about to complete a PhD in a relevant area
of
Computer Science, Mathematics, or Artificial Intelligence. Candidates
are not
expected to be familiar with all of the application areas mentioned
above, but
suitable research experience in one of the following areas would be
useful:
spatial reasoning, computational geometry, theory of image analysis,
computer
graphics, formal aspects of GIS. Applications are also welcome from
candidates whose main experience has been in a relevant area of topology
or geometry.

Details of the formal aplication procedure will be available
shortly, but anyone interested in this post should contact Dr John Stell
by email:
j.g.stell@cs.keele.ac.uk or by phone: 01782 584083.

Factorization Systems and Distributive Laws 

R. Rosebrugh and R. J. Wood 

This article shows that the distributive laws of Beck in the bicategory of
sets and matrices determine strict factorization systems on their
composite monads ( = categories). Conversely, it is shown that strict
factorization systems on categories give rise to distributive laws.
Moreover, these processes are shown to be mutually inverse in a precise
sense. Further, an extension of the distributive law concept provides a
correspondence with the classical orthogonal factorization systems.

hi.

i am wondering if there are any keen **software builders /
designers / developers** among the categorically minded?

there are several places that would be happy to have such
people, and
might be able to make them happy.

                RelMiS 2001 - Relational Methods in Software
                ============================================

                        7-8 April 2001, Genova, Italy

                     http://ist.unibw-muenchen.de/RelMiS/

                       A Satellite Event to ETAPS 2001

Motivation
==========

The role of the calculus of relations in algebra and logic is now well
understood and appreciated; relational methods should be part of the
``toolbox'' of everyone who uses mathematics, and relational methods can
also be of great value to everyone who develops or uses computer science.

For example, much of the work on special logics or ``laws'' for programs is
easily understood as an application of relational algebra. Also, every
relation on a state space can be used as a specification or description of a
program. This, in itself, is an advantage over some predicate based
formalism in which one can write ``specifications'' that are impossible to
satisfy.

Computer science, as a new application field for
relational methods, has both drawn from and contributed to previous
logico/mathematical work. Further integration of the two areas of research
would benefit both.

The purpose of this event is to provide (1) a tutorial introduction to
relational methods for computer scientists and software developers, and
(2) a workshop to discuss new results and future work.

7 April: Tutorial Day
=====================

There will be the following tutorial lectures:

   * Gunther Schmidt: Basics of Relational Methods (9:30 - 11:00)
   * David L. Parnas: The Tabular Method for Relational Documentation (11:30
     - 13:00)
   * Wolfram Kahl: Refinement and Development of Programs from Relational
     Specifications (14:30 - 16:00)
   * Rudolf Berghammer: Prototyping and Programming with Relations (16:30 -
     18:00)


8 April:
Workshop ``Relational Methods in Software Development - Current Issues''
========================================================================

The second day of the RelMiS event will be an open workshop. Topics of the
workshop include, but are not limited to:

* Relational Specifications and Modelling:
     methods and tools, tabular methods, abstract data types
* Relational Software Design and Development Techniques:
     relational refinement, heuristic approaches for derivation, correctness
     considerations, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, catamorphisms,
     paramorphisms, hylomorphisms and related topics
* Programming with Relations:
     prototyping, testing, fault tolerance, information systems, information
     coding
* Implementing relational algebra with mixed representation of relations
* Handling of Large Relations:
     problems of scale, innovative representations, distributed
     implementation

The number of papers will be kept small to allow extensive discussion.

               4th International Workshop on
      Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science (CMCS2001)

                        Genova, Italy
                        6-7 April 2001

              A satellite workshop of ETAPS 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

Aims and Scope

During the last few years, it is becoming increasingly clear
that a great variety of state-based dynamical systems, like
transition systems, automata, process calculi and
class-based systems can be captured uniformly as
coalgebras. Coalgebra is developing into a field of its own
interest presenting a deep mathematical foundation, a
growing field of applications and interactions with various
other fields such as reactive and interactive system theory,
object oriented and concurrent programming, formal system
specification, modal logic, dynamical systems, control
systems, category theory, algebra, analysis, etc. The aim of
the workshop is to bring together researchers with a common
interest in the theory of coalgebras and its applications.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

   * the theory of coalgebras (including set theoretic and
     categorical approaches);
   * coalgebras as computational and semantical models (for
     programming languages, dynamical systems, etc.);
   * coalgebras in (functional, object-oriented, concurrent)
     programming;
   * coalgebras and data types;
   * (coinductive) definition and proof principles for
     coalgebras (with bisimulations or invariants);
   * coalgebras and algebras;
   * coalgebraic specification and verification;
   * coalgebras and (modal) logic;
   * coalgebra and control theory (notably of discrete event
     and hybrid systems).

The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent
and ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new
ideas and future trends.

Previous workshops of the same series have been organized in
Lisbon, Amsterdam and Berlin. The proceedings appeared as
ENTCS Vols. 11,19 and 33.

------------------------------------------------------------

Location

CMCS2001 will be held in Genova on 6-7 April 2001, just
after ETAPS2001 (European Joint Conferences on Theory and
Practice of Software).

   MCU'95 and MCU'98 gave rise to TCS special issues on "Universal 
Machines and Computations" : 168-2 (1996) and 231-2 (2000). The interest
of computer scientists for the topics of the conference increased during 
the last years. New domains have appeared, continuing the traditional
approaches in a natural way. This explains why a regular scientific
meeting on this topics must hold, at least each three years.
Initially the name of the conference was "MACHINES ET CALCULS UNIVERSELS" 
(in French); the English translation was "Universal Machines and
Computations" and this was the title of the corresponding TCS issues. In
order to keep the same abbreviation, the new English name of the conference 
is "MACHINES, COMPUTATIONS AND UNIVERSALITY".

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS

   Besides invited lectures, about thirty contributions are planned. As a first
step, lectures and contributions will be published in a volume of Lecture Notes
in Computer Science devoted to the proceedings of the conference. Participants 
will receive that volume at their arrival.
   Contributions should be submitted as 12 page papers with an extra page
indicating the name of the author(s), his/her/their affiliation, e-mail and
addresses as well as the title of the contribution, a list of key-words and
a short abstract within 300 words. Submissions must conform to the usual
LNCS format, see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.  
   Contributions will be submitted by e-mail as a NON ENCODED PostScript file 
(any encoding will entail rejection of the submission). Accepted contributions
will possibly have to be corrected according to the remarks of the referee. In 
any case, accepted contributions should be send in LATEX format, conform to 
instructions to be found at the above URL. 

Please, keep in mind the following dates :

         Deadline for submission (extended) :      December 15, 2000  *NEW*
         Notification of acceptance or rejection : February  1, 2001
         Deadline for corrected version of accepted papers :

Hi,
given a Set-endofunctor F:Set-->Set and a "type" L of limit
I'm searching for a "related" functor F_L:Set--->Set that
preserves that type of limit. 

Example: As Vera Trnkova has proved around 1970 each
Set-endofunctor can turned into a functor that preserves
pullbacks of injective mappings just by modifying it
on the empty set and the empty mappings. - Now given
a functor that does not preserve pullbacks I'd like
to find a "related" one that does.

I'm not quite sure what "related" means. My
first idea was to consider the functor category
Fun(Set,Set) (not being abhorred by possible
size problems) and the subcategory Fun_L(Set,Set)
of Set-endofunctors that preserve limits
of type L. Then if Fun_L(Set,Set) were reflective
or coreflective in Fun(Set,Set) ...
but I think it is not. 

So does anybody have an idea which type of
"relatedness" could be considered? Is
there some concept concerning these problem
in category theory?

Thank you very much

Tobias Schroeder

Dear friends,
I'm a M.S. student on Computer Science and I'm working with partial
constructions in categories.
I'm very interested in works describing the inheritance of limits, colimits,
products, etc, when dealing with partial categories. I've tried to find
papers on the subject but I had no success.
I would be very thankful for the help I could receive.
Thanks in advance.

S.Costa

Dear Colleagues,

I am preparing notes for a sophomore (second year)
course, and I am finding several places wherein
I can find no standard notation.  Your suggestions
will be most appreciated.

(1) Everybody knows that {(n,n+1) | n \in Z}
    is the <<successor>> relation.  What to call
    the corresponding idea when the underlying
    order is only a partial order?
      I am currently using <<followers>> as in
    phrases such as
    ``...the followers relation for the subsets
    of the finite set {a, b, c}...''
    in which ({a},{a,b}) is in the followers
    relation, but {{a},{a,b,c}) is not, anymore
    that (n,n+2) is in the successor relation.

      Is there a better word than <<followers>>?

(2) I need a snappy name for an order pair in
    a relation R.  The books I have seem to just
    say ``...the ordered pair (x,y) in relation R...''
    The problem is that there are many uses of
    ordered pairs, and this is a specific use,
    a description of the fact that 
       x is R-related to y
    by the fact that (x,y) \in R.
      The word ``association'' will not do as this
    has other meaning in computer science.  I am
    considered <<relator>> for an order pair in
    a relation, but have the impression that this
    word has been used for other purposes in the
    literature.

(3) I badly need a good name for the sets
        Nat_k = {n \in Nat | n < k }
    These are widely used and I am surprised that
    there is no satisfactory name in wide-spread use.
      These are NOT the sets Z_k = Z mod k,
    although the Nat_k form a system of distinct,
    canonical representatives for the Z_k.
      These are the set of array indices in computer
    languages such as C and SML.  In this use, the
    Nat_k have nothing whatsoever to do with Z_k
    and I certainly do not want to confuse the students!

Thank you in advance for any and all suggestions,
David

Dr E Goubault (ENS, Paris; Commission Energie Atomique) will visit
the School of Informatics, University of Wales, Bangor, UK,  on Dec 19, 20
2000 and give two talks, the second of which will be more mathematical:


Tuesday, Dec 19, 4:00pm, Room 149


Geometric semantics for the analysis of concurrent and distributed
software

ABSTRACT: This talk will be focused on applications of geometrical ideas
and
modeling to computer scientific problems, among which: -
relationship with other models for concurrency (for instance
transition systems and Petri nets). - static analysis of
concurrent programs (mostly Java-like threads); in particular,
deadlocks, reachable states, scheduling properties (joint work
with Martin Raussen and Lisbeth Fajstrup), state-space reduction
techniques. - scheduling properties of distributed systems; in
particular serialisability conditions for databases (after Jeremy
Gunawardena and Martin Raussen), computability in fault-tolerant
systems (after Maurice Herlihy and Sergio Rajsbaum).

Wednesday, Dec 20th 11:15 pm, Room S5

Recent developments of "geometric concurrency theory"

ABSTRACT: In this talk, I will present some of the "geometrical theories"
used for modeling concurrent systems. Among these are: - the
(di-)topological approaches where the flow of concurrent
executions is modeled by a topological space of states plus local
partial orders on it. This is very much related to the "progress
graphs" of E. W. Dijkstra. I will also outline some links with
similar objects introduced in domain theory. Some of the algebraic
topology which is useful for describing interesting (scheduling)
properties of concurrent systems will be described (many results
from Martin Raussen and Lisbeth Fajstrup, Aalborg University). I
will also refer to recent work by Stefan Sokolowski, Gdansk
University. - the semi-cubical set approach which is in some way a
combinatorial counterpart of the topological approach. This is
very much related to ordinary transition systems semantics. This
was described first by Vaughan Pratt and Rob van Glabbeek,
Stanford University. - the omega-categorical approach (cubical
and/or globular of course) initiated also by Vaughan Pratt. Most
of this work has been developped by Philippe Gaucher, IRMA,
Strasbourg University.

I will add some recent developments (joint work with Philippe
Gaucher), and also some other "applications" of these ideas (in
Logics, joint work with Jean Goubault-Larrecq).




All are welcome. It is hoped the above schedule will allow good
time for discussion.

The paper (for abstract, see below)

Aczel P., Adamek J., Velebil J.: Iteration Monads, preprint 

is now available from

http://math.feld.cvut.cz/velebil/

----------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:

It has already been noticed by C. Elgot and his
collaborators that the algebra of (finite and infinite)
trees is completely iterative, i.e., every system of
ideal recursive equations has a unique solution.
We prove that this is a special case of a very general
coalgebraic phenomenon: suppose that an endofunctor
H of an abstract category A is ``iterative'',
i.e., that it has the property that for every object
X in A a final coalgebra for H(_)+X
exists. Then these final coalgebras, TX, form a
monad on A, called the iteration monad of H.
And every ideal equation e : X --> T(X+Y) has 
a unique solution e^+: X --> TY.

We also present a more general view substituting
the category [A,A] of all endofunctors
of A by a monoidal category B: an  object H in B 
is called iterative if the endofunctor 
H tensor (_)+I  of B has a final coalgebra. This coalgebra 
is, then, a monoid in B, called the iteration monoid
of H. And the assignment of an iteration monoid
to all objects forms a monoid in [B,B].

Depends what you want to talk about. If you want to talk about R as
simple a set then I would normally  refer to an
element of R a tuple of R where the context tells you that
the tuple is of length two.

  If you take a look at 

     http://slate.msn.com/diary/00-11-27/diary.asp?iMsg=1

  you will find (in a column by Jim Holt) that "Category theory is a
  ridiculously abstract framework that takes all the meaning out of
  mathematics." At the end of the column is an invitation to make
  comments. (Please don't!) Only one such comment seems to be about
  category theory and it's this beauty:

Subject: category theory

Category theory was not so bad when the Poles invented it. It was sort
of like reinventing the parts of speech or the distinction between
accident and substance. Later it was like subject and predicate, noun
and verb. The Dutch logicians have made it quite obscure. Here's to
better understanding of category theory and a less defeatist attitude.

  (This almost makes sense if you substitute "categorial grammar" for
  "category theory". But if you do that you then have to turn Jim
  Lambek into a Pole.)

  Here's the full Holt column. I'm certain that any attempt to counter
  the statement about category theory -- given the mood of the piece
  -- can only fail.

Being at MSRI is a bit like going to heaven without all the bother and
expense of dying. I don't mean the sort of heaven where you wear
ermine and eat foie gras to the sound of trumpets. I mean the sort
where you spend your days languidly communing with beautiful,
timeless, abstract ideas: Platonic heaven.

MSRI stands for the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. It is
the premier think tank in the world for pure mathematics. Even its
location is heavenly: It is housed in a Corbusian glass-and-wood
structure perched atop the loftiest of the hills above the University
of California at Berkeley, just below the ionosphere. From my office
window, I gaze down upon the skyscrapers of San Francisco, the isle of
Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Pacific Ocean. In a few minutes
I will leave my office, traverse some pristine white hallways, and
join a hundred of the most eminent mathematicians from around the
world in a commodious lecture room. Today's topic for contemplation:
the linear p-adic group, the p-adic Galois group, and the p-affine
Schur algebra.

But wait. I am not a mathematician (although I have sometimes
pretended to be one on NPR). I am a "trivial being," to use Paul
Erdos' term for those who are not among the mathematical elect. So
what am I doing in this Platonic heaven? I am here as a journalist in
residence. My mandate is to convey a little of the flavor of what goes
on in these ethereal precincts to my fellow trivial beings back in the
material world. I also cannot help thinking of myself as an
anthropologist, living among an alien tribe and observing their often
strange folkways. I must be careful not to give them measles.

How can I blend into this august tribe? As a longtime mathematical
dilettante, I sometimes understand a little of what they are saying. I
also do a good bit of faking. Luckily I have come up with a set of
all-purpose trick questions that have kept my ignorance from being
exposed in many a treacherous conversation. For example:

"Can that result be restated in terms of category theory?" (Category
theory is a ridiculously abstract framework that takes all the meaning
out of mathematics.)

"Isn't the constant in that equation suspiciously close to the square
root of pi divided by e cubed?"

"Wasn't your theorem prefigured in the work of Euler?" (Leonhard
Euler, who lived in the 18th century, was the most prolific
mathematician in history; nearly everything is prefigured in his
work.)

"But can you prove that lemma for the case of n=3?"

By the shrewd use of such feints, I, a trivial being, have been able
to chat as an apparent peer with many of my colleagues at MSRI. Above
all, I am careful not to let conversations about things like p-adic
Galois groups go on for too long. When skating over thin ice, speed is
your ally.

	I don't think David was trying to generalize the successor
relation in the sense of finding a "moral equivalent" in a poset for
the natural numbers' successor _function_. All he wants - I think -
is a notation for "a > b and there is no a>c>b". I would suggest
using an indefinite article with a noun formation:
 
	" a is _a_ successor of b" 

or a prepositional formation that does not connote uniqueness or
necessary existence:

	 "a is immediately above b"

Bob Pare and I used "<!" for this in our 1993 paper on tileorders.

	It may be - is this what you're getting at, Paul? - that if one
finds a successor relation is natural or useful for what one's looking at,
then one should wonder hard about whether it would be better thought of as
a well-founded structure rather than as a poset, so as to avoid the
repetition of "and not equal to". But there are certainly cases where
after the wondering one would conclude "no it isn't."

Universal algebraists (but not category theorists??) call b the _cover_ of
a when a<b with nothing in between.  See e.g. the index of such lattice
theory texts as Davey and Priestley or McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor
(Walter).  (MM&T distinguish upper cover and lower cover but obviously
an unqualified cover has to mean the upper kind to all but us Aussies.)
In a well-ordered set, "cover" and "successor" are synonymous: an ordinal
is a cover just when it is a successor ordinal.

Managed not to mention reflexivity---oops.

Dear Colleagues,

Thank you for the responses!

(1) Several pointed out that my <<followers>> relations are
    said to be <<covering>> relations in combinatorics.
    These relations are defined as relations which are
      1. acyclic
      2. without interpolants, as Robert Dawson mentioned.
    A followers relation for discrete partial order R is
    the least relation whose reflexive and transitive closure
    is R.
       This agrees entirely with the definition of a
    successor relation being the least relation whose
    transitive closure is a discrete strict total order and whose
    reflexive and transitive closure is a discrete total order.
       In the case of successor, there is a distinct
    next element, as in the succession of the Kings (and Queens)
    of England.  In the case of followers, there is in
    general a set of next elements, such as the followers
    of Cromwell.

(2) While several alternatives were offered, I will try
    Paul Taylor's <<instance>> of a relation to describe
    an ordered pair (x,y) \in R.

(3) The problem of a good name for the sets Nat_k remains.
    Suggestions included
      finite ordinals
      numerals
      order ideals
    and by far the most appropriate for my purposes,
      index sets
    [This problem of a good name is worthy of some further attention.
     Computer science second year students will think 
       of <<finite ordinals>> as a number, not a set,
       of <<numerals>> as representations of the digits in a number system,
     and have not be exposed to order ideals.]

Cheers,
David

In that case I believe there is established terminology/notation in
lattice theory, they say "a covers b", denoted b -< a, and corresponding
intervals (i.e. intervals with [a,b]={a,b}) are called gaps.

Readers of the cat list may be interested in the one meaningful post

                                               category theory

It is sad more than a decade on since the
proof of the remarkable categorical coherence
theorem of Shum that mathematicians can
continue to view category theory as a mere
linguistic convention or useless abstraction.

Shum's theorem shows that axioms
completely natural from the internal dynamic of
category theory completely characterize
framed tangles, relative versions of the framed
knots and links which are central to
smooth topology in 3 and 4 dimensions (notice
the dimensionality of space and of
space-time: hardly divorced from meaning.) Other
categories satisfying the same axioms
include the categories of representations of
quantum groups, physically motivated
algebraic structures which have become central
objects of study for mathematicians from
many old branches of mathematics.

Indeed, Shum's theorem, a theorem of
category theory, is the only really satisfying
explanation for the intimate connection
between quantum groups and low-dimensional
topology.

My paper applying logic-based probability (LBP) to mathematical physics was
just published, and is entitled "Magnetic monopoles, massive neutrinos and
gravitation via logic-experimental unification theory (LEUT) and
Kursunoglu's theory," pages 89-97 of the volume Quantum Gravity, Generalized
Theory of Gravitation, and Superstring Theory-Based Unification, Editors B.
N. Kursunoglu (Ph.D. from Cambridge University under Professor Paul Dirac),
S. L. Mintz, and A. Perlmutter, Kluwer Academic/Plenum: New York 2000.   The
relevance of LBP to categories is largely in its ability to generalize
across categories, which it shares with Clifford algebra/octonions/Grassmann
algebra (Bayliss, Crawford, Chisholm, Pezzaglia, Hestenes, Benn, Okubo,
etc.) and in string theory with the orientation of S. Weinberg.  Much of the
generalizing work has been done since the above paper, and hopefully I will
be able to succinctly present some of it here in future.  I will say in
preview that LBP isolates the transition from division to subtraction (often
ignored by other fields) and keeps track of logic-algebra relationships and
I regard these as a major source of its ability to transcend categories and
apply across disciplines.  Most of the people cited above also have unusual
tolerance for new ideas, even those which disagree with their own theories
and those of the majority of theorists.  I like to think of at as partly a
great sensitivity to the past, present, and future - not just to one of
them.

I don't think one should blame the guy whose remarks Peter quoted.  He is
not a mathematician and presumably knows nothing more than some college
level mathematics.  He has picked up that attitude from the high-powered
mathematicians that inhabit places like MSRI (and the CRM, Fields Inst.,
and PIMS in Canada).  Ignoring the fact that category theory was fathered
by two of the most eminent mathematicians of the last century and
god-fathered by arguably the very greatest, they still go around saying
that it is without content and nothing but meaningless abstraction.  I was
unaware of what David Yetter mentioned, but I am certainly aware of the
crucial role categories had in proving the Weil conjectures and the fact
that people like John Baez seem to believe that higher dimensional
categories will be important in physics.  I might also point out that
categories were the right framework for Kaplansky's very elegant proof of
the Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem.  And here is a question: are categories
more abstract or less abstract than sets?

I had been looking at the standard way the topological closure A |-> CA
can be recovered from the derived set operation A |-> A' (which takes A to
the set of the accumulation points of A) by setting CA := A' u A, and
observed that it can be generalized to categorical language. If you take
thing made up of a coproduct-preserving functor D and a natural
transformation t : D^2 -> D, such that t is `associative' in the usual
sense of asserting that t o t_D = t o Dt, and also 

 p_{X,Y} o t_{X + Y} = (t_X + t_Y) o p_{DX,DY} o Dp_{X,Y}

where p is the canonical natural transformation D(X + Y) -> DX + DY , then
if one defines

TX := DX + X
eta_X := inr_{DX + X}
mu_X := ([1_{DX},1_{DX}] + X) a_{DX,DX,X} (([t_X,1_{DX}] o p_{DX,X}) + TX)

(where [ , ] is copairing and a_{X,Y,Z} is the associativity isomorphism X
+ (Y + Z) -> (X + Y) + Z) then turns out that (T, eta, mu) is a monad.

Has anyone already studied these? I'd be particularly interested in a
type-theoretic or logical (along the lines of the correspondence between 
monads and modal operators) interpretation of such a structure, if any.

I agree that there is a need for a standard name, and that Nat_k would 
be a confusing name.  I have been calling
this set $k for some time but I am happy to change my macro if there
is some other accepted name or if $ has some other mathematical meaning. 
More generally, if k is an ordinal, one writes $k for the set of
ordinals less than k, the canonical well-ordered set of order-type k.
(The traditional ZF definition of ordinal makes k equal to $k, but
that is just an implementation.)   

A similarly useful terminology for arrays and the like is
"obaz", which indicates the use of the "ordinals begin at zero"
convention.  Thus you can refer to the cell with index 7 in your array 
 as the obaz 7th cell instead of as the 8th cell.
You can't call it the 7th cell, without qualification, because in
English the obao ("ordinals begin at one") convention is the 
established default, unfortunately.

As an example, today is the obaz 28th day of the obaz 10th month of the
year obaz 1999, which is the final year of the obaz 19th century and not 
the obaz zeroth year of the obaz 20th century as many obaoists mistakenly
believe.   Though I'm hardly the zeroth person to point this out (obaz).

Warning: this usage may alienate the less tolerant of your friends.

Regards
Paul

Bonjour,


I have a general question about localizations.

I know that for any category C, if S is a set of morphisms, then 
C[S^-1] exists. And moreover if C is small, then C[S^{-1}] is small
as well (as in the Borceux's book Handbook of categorical algebra I)

If S is not small, and if we suppose that all sets are in some universe
U, then the previous construction  gives a solution as a V-small category
for some universe V with U \in V (the objects are the same but the homsets
need not to be U-small). So it does not work if one wants to get U-small 
homsets.

Another way is to have a calculus of fractions (left or right) and if
S is locally small as defined in Weibel's book "Introduction to homological
algebra". 

But in my case, the Ore condition is not satisfied. Hence the question : 
is there other constructions for C[S^{-1}] ?


Thanks in advance. pg.

Dear All,

Philippe's question may be answered in part by looking 
at the construction by Baues and Dugundji (Trans Amer Math Soc 140
(1969) 239 - 256). Another point is that in the homotopical applications
it is not that the Ore condition is satisfied but that it is satisfied
up to homotopy that counts. A discussion of this in at least one case is
to be found on pages 90 - 111 of the book by Heiner Kamps and myself.
(see my homepage for the detailed coordinates if you want. The set
theoretic question was looked at by various people including Markus
Pfenniger in an unpublished manuscript in 1989.

Jason Reed's construction, adjoining a unit to obtain a monad,
seems to generalize one of the steps in the proof by Pare', Rosebrugh,
and Wood that any lex idempotent can be split in two steps, one of
the steps involving a left adjoint splitting and the other a right
adjoint splitting.  I believe this result was published about ten years
ago in Australia.

It is not clear if you are interested in special cases or in general
conditions.  If the latter, I cannot help, but here is an example of a
special case.  But first, I might ask why it matters.  Gabriel-Zisman
ignores the question and I think they are right to.  Every category is
small in another universe.  

Consider the category C of chain complexes from some abelian category. By
this I mean bounded below with a boundary operator of degree -1.  Arrows
are chain maps of degree 0.  Let S denote the class of homotopy
equivalences and T the class of homology isomorphisms.  Then S < T and
there is neither a calculus of right or left fractions for either.  On the
other hand S^{-1}C is equivalent to C/~ in which you have identified
homotopic arrows.  This is locally small because you leave the objects
alone and it is a quotient.  From S < T, it follows that T^{-1}C =
T^{-1}S^{-1}C = T^{-1}(C/~) and the image of T in C/~ does have a calculus
of fractions (both left and right; duality implies that they are
equivalent).  Thus there is a notion of homotopy calculus of fractions in
this case.  I have tried, without success, to find a general condition
of which this would be a special case.

There is a trap lurking in this question, and it has to do with
understanding the term "abstract":  different notions of "abstract"
can lead to different answers to the question.  In the case of sets
and categories, since these are of different similarity types,
something other than inclusion of classes of models is meant.  For
example "abstract", applied to sets and categories, might mean:

1. Having wider applicability.  In this case, we can observe that the
   theorems of category theory (e.g., products are unique up to unique
   isomorphism) are generally more widely applicable than theorems of
   set theory (e.g., the powerset of a set has greater cardinality
   than the set itself), and so we would be inclined to say that
   categories are more abstract than sets on this criterion.

2. Having more general conditions for being an instance.  In order to
   specify a set, we need only give (list, characterize) its members.
   To specify a category we need to do the same thing for both the
   collection of objects and the collection of arrows, and then we
   need to specify the composition law.  (Even in an arrows-only
   formulation of category theory, we still need to specify both the
   collection of arrows and the composition law.)  So, on this
   criterion, sets come out as more abstract.

Some time ago, on the Foundations of Mathematics mailing list (FOM),
there was a long and sometimes heated debate on alternative
foundations of mathematics (where alternative meant non-set-theoretic)
-- in particular on the viability of some kind of category-theoretic
foundation for mathematics (e.g., elementary topos theory + some
additional axioms) -- and the majority view seemed to be that

- Set theory is more all-encompassing.  The standard arguments about
  the bi-interpretability of category theory and set theory were met
  with the challenge (unanswered, as far as I know) to produce, in a
  category-theoretic foundation, a natural linearly-ordered sequence
  of axioms of higher infinity that can be used to "calibrate" the
  existential commitments of extensions to the basic axioms comparable
  to the large cardinal axioms of set theory, where the naturality
  requirement supposedly precludes the slavish translation of these
  large cardinal axioms into the language of category theory.  (Recall
  that all known large cardinal axioms for set theory fall into a very
  nice linear hierarchy that can be used to gauge the consistency
  strength of a theory.)

- Set theory is conceptually simpler.  Set theory axiomatizes a
  single, very basic concept (membership), expressed using a single
  binary relation, and posits a natural set of axioms for this
  relation that are (more or less) neatly justified in terms of a
  fairly (some would say perfectly) clear semantic conception, the
  cumulative hierarchy.  Category theory, the view goes, could only
  approach the scope of set theory, if at all, by adding many axioms
  that are unnatural and quite complicated to state and work with
  without the aid of multiple layers of definitions and definitional
  theorems (for products, exponentials, power-objects/subobject
  classifier, higher replacement-like closure conditions on the
  category, etc.).

The arguments put forward in support of these views were very similar
to those that are implicit in the labeling of category theory as
"ridiculously abstract", and there are no doubt many readers of this
list who would disagree with part or all of these views (me, for one).
However, my intention in reporting them here is *not* to start another
set-theory vs category theory thread, but rather to point out that,
although category theorists have yet to make a convincing case -- at
least I haven't seen one -- that category theory is more fundamental
or foundational in any important sense (sorry, Paul), recent research
in cognitive science on the embodied and metaphorical nature of our
thinking indicates that category theory may well be able to make such
a claim after all.  See the books

    G. Lakoff and M. Johnson.  Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied
    Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought.  Basic Books, 1999.

    G. Lakoff and R. Nuñez.  Where Mathematics Comes From: How the
    Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being.  Basic Books, 2000.

for a popular account of this research.  I should mention, of course,
that, closer to home, the book

    F.W. Lawvere and S.H. Schanuel, Conceptual Mathematics:  A First
    Introduction to Category Theory.  Cambridge University Press, 1997. 

is certainly a step in this direction.

When I am confronted with this attitude, I sometimes use a couple of 
arguments in addition to the usual one of listing things that category 
theory is good for.  I present them here in a rather blunt form; they 
can be toned down as politeness dictates.

1) "You say category theory is `too abstract'.  But if you don't like
abstraction, why in the world are you doing mathematics?  Maybe you 
should be in finance, where the numbers all have dollar signs in front
of them.  Complaining that a piece of mathematics is `too abstract' 
is a bit like saying that the ocean is `too wet'."  

2) "You say category theory is `too abstract'.  Good!  Don't learn it!
That way, I'll make progress in my research faster than you." 

> And here is a question: are categories more abstract or less abstract 
> than sets?

Indeed, what we often take as "greater abstraction" is really 
unfamiliarity.  The real answer to the problem of people thinking
categories are "too abstract" is to keep explaining category theory
and how it's useful in a wide variety of problems... until people 
get used to it.   Physicists used to think groups were too abstract!

A higher-dimensional category theorist's answer:
"Neither - a set is merely a 0-category, and a category a 1-category."

There's a more serious thought behind this.  Sometimes I've wondered, in a
vague way, whether the much-discussed hierarchy

0-categories (sets) form a (1-)category, 
(1-)categories form a 2-category, 
...

has a role to play in foundations.  After all, set-theorists seek to found
mathematics on the theory of 0-categories; category-theorists sometimes talk
about founding mathematics on the theory of 1-categories and providing a
(Lawverian) axiomatization of the 1-category of 0-categories; you might ask
"what next"?  Axiomatize the 2-category of (1-)categories?  Or the
(n+1)-category of n-categories?  Could it even be, I ask with tongue in cheek
and head in clouds, that general n-categories provide a more natural
foundation than either 0-categories or 1-categories?
