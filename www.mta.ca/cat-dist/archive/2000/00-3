Can you complete this analogy?

  ``Large cardinals are to ZFC, as ???? are to topos theory.''

One answer is "Grothendieck universes", but they correspond to rather
small large cardinals. Can we go further than that?

Can anyone explain why the codomain fibration cod: C^\rightarrow -> C,
which requires pull-backs, gets loads of attention, while the domain
fibration dom: C^rightarrow -> C, which works for all C, hardly gets a
look in?  Is the dom fibration really such a poor relation?

The "7th Workshop on Logic, Language, Information and Computation"
(WoLLIC'2000), the seventh version of a series of workshops which started
in 1994 with the aim of fostering interdisciplinary research in pure and
applied logic, will be held in Natal, Brazil, from August 15th to 18th 2000.
Contributions are invited in the form of short papers (10 A4 10pt pages) in
all areas related to logic, language, information and computation, including:
pure logical systems, proof theory, model theory, algebraic logic, type theory,
category theory, constructive mathematics, lambda and combinatorial calculi,
program logic and program semantics, logics and models of concurrency,
logic and complexity theory, nonclassical logics, nonmonotonic logic,
logic and language, discourse representation, logic and artificial
intelligence, automated deduction, foundations of logic programming,

de Logica (SBL).

THE LOCATION
Natal is the capital and largest city of Rio Grande do Norte, a sun shiny
land of beaches, dunes, coconut trees, located in north-east coast of Brazil.
There, the summer takes all year long (sun shines more than 300 days per
year), and the heat is softened by a constant breeze. Along the 400-kilometer
(250-mile) coast line, calm beaches with reefs forming natural pools altern
with good surfing spots, almost untouched places full of sand dunes and
coconut trees. 

GUEST SPEAKERS
There will be a number of guest speakers, including:
Andrea Asperti (Univ Bologna, Italy)
Angus Macintyre (Edinburgh Univ, Scotland)
Luiz Carlos Pereira (Pontificial Catholic Univ of Rio, Brazil)
Toniann Pitassi (Arizona Univ, USA)
Bruno Poizat (Univ Lyon I, France)

e-mail to wollic@di.ufpe.br, or in 5(five) copies to postal address) must
be RECEIVED by MAY 7th, 2000 by the Chair of the Organising Committee.
Papers must be ANONYMOUS (a separate identification page must be included),
written in English and give enough detail to allow the programme committee
to assess the merits of the work.  Papers should start with a brief

I have a couple of points to make about this.

	1) By duality, the "poor relation" fibration dom can be 
viewed as the opfibration cod.  So it is not so poor after all, just 
part of an even richer structure of cod.

	2) Fibrations over  C  "amount" to pseudofunctors  C^op --> 
Cat.  Let  S    be the pseudofunctor  S(u) = C/u  on objects, using 
pullback on arrows; this is the "rich guy".  The "poor guy"  T  is a 
covariant functor (not just pseudo)  T(u) = C/u ,  using composition 
on arrows.  To get a contravariant Cat-valued functor on  C,  follow 
T  by the presheaf construction  P : Cat^coop --> Cat.  It turns out 
then that the Yoneda embedding gives a fully faithful pseudonatural 
transformation  y :  S --> PT.  Now  PT  is a very important 
character; every internal full subcategory of the topos  E  of 
presheaves on  C  is a full subobject of  PT.  (A good example is 
where  E  is globular sets and  PT  is the globular category of 
higher spans.)  It is true that  S  can be thought of as an internal 
model of  E  in  Cat(E)  leading to indexed (or parametrized) 
category theory.  But the reason this works well is that S is a full 
subobject of  PT. Again  T  wins out!

Regards,
Ross

heh, the amount of attention is not always proportional to the depth of
the issue. but in this case, i think, there are good reasons for
asymmetry.

the idea of fibred (or indexed) category theory over, say, a base S, is
that each category C is always given together with all categories C^I of
I-indexed families from C, where I are the objects of S. indeed, ordinary
categories are always given with their set indexed versions. we are
tacitly using C^2 to say "product". joining all such indexed versions of C
as the fibres, we get the fibred presentation of C, its "externalization".

but now, the base category S itself should come about as an object of
category theory over S as well. in ordinary category theory, we often
mention the category of sets. the base fibration cod: Ar(S) --> S is the
externalization of S itself as fibred over S. indeed, its fibres, the
slices S/I are the abstract categories of I-indexed families from S. when
S is Set, they are equivalent to S^I; but the latter may not exist for a
general S. the pullbacks in S correspond to reindexing within S. if there
is no reindexing, then S is a poor base for category theory, because it
cannot even reindex itself.

however, even the categories S that cannot reindex themselves, they can
always comprehend themselves (in a formal sense of categorical
psychology). this is expressed by the functor dom: Ar(S)-->S. whether cod
is a fibration or not, there is always the adjunction cod -| ids -| dom:
Ar(S) -->S, which is the categorical form of the comprehension scheme, as
studied by Lawvere and later others, who generalized the adjunction
requirements away, so that the conceptual link with the set theoretical
idea of comprehension got lost...

in any case, if you embed CAT_S--->FIB/S, then cod: Ar(S)-->S is the image
of S itself, while dom: Ar(S)-->S is not in the image of the embedding,
but a derived concept.

                     SECOND  CALL FOR PAPERS

                       LICS'2000 Workshop on

               Chu Spaces: Theory and Applications

          Sunday, June 25, 2000, Santa Barbara, California

              http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/chu.html

A Chu space is a related pair of complementary objects.
Besides having intrinsic interest in their own right, Chu spaces
have found applications to concurrent processes, information flow,
linear logic, proof theory, and universal categories.  The workshop is
concerned with the theory and applications of Chu spaces, as well as
related structures such as the Dialectica construction and double glueing.

The workshop will bring together computer scientists, mathematicians,
logicians, philosophers, and other interested parties to discuss the
development of the subject with regard to its foundations, applications,
prospects, and directions for future work.  Work in the subject is
currently fragmented across several areas: category theory, traditional
model theory, concurrency, and the semantics of programming languages,
and such a workshop can contribute to the coordination and possibly even
some unification of these efforts.

Suggested topics for presentation and discussion include but are by no
means limited to new results about Chu spaces and related structures;
their applications to various areas such as concurrency, games, proof
theory, etc.; and their implications for foundations and philosophy of
computation, mathematics, physics, and other disciplines.

The workshop will be held on Sunday, June 25, 2000 at Santa Barbara,
California, as an adjunct to the International Conference on Logic in
Computer Science (LICS'2000), June 26-29 at the same location as per
http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/libkin/lics/index.html.

Papers within the scope of the workshop are solicited, and may be either
work in progress or more mature work.  Submission should be in the form
of an extended abstract of at most 10 pages, in postscript format, mailed
electronically to paiva@parc.xerox.com.  Submissions will be evaluated
by a committee selected by the organizers, and the full version of
accepted papers will be printed in a proceedings available at the start
of the workshop.

Important dates:

    Extended abstract:          April 25, 2000
    Notification of acceptance: May 15, 2000
    Proceedings version:        June 9, 2000

The workshop will be one full day and is open to all interested
researchers.

As you may be aware, the AMS is holding a regional meeting (#957 ) in
Toronto September 22-24, 2000. Walter Tholen and I are organizing a
special session in that meeting entitled Applied Categorical Structures.
We hope you can attend.

The preliminary list of speakers includes: Lars Birkedal, Marta Bunge,
Robin Cockett, Jack Duskin, Andre Joyal, Jim Lambek, Bill Lawvere, Michael
Makkai, Bob Pare, Jiri Rosicky, Myles Tierney, Enrico Vitale, and Richard
Wood.

There will be time in total for 20 lectures of approximately 25 minutes
duration. We would be happy to receive proposals for additional talks to
complete our list. The AMS encourages expository talks in special
sessions. If you would like to speak, please send us at this time a title
or brief desciption of your proposed talk. If we are able to include you
as a speaker, you will have to provide an abstract to be printed in the
appropriate issue of the AMS journal Abstracts. We will inform you of the
particulars later.

Unfortunately, the AMS does not provide financial assistance to any of
those participating in the special sessions. We hope this will not be an
impediment to your participation. We expect to make the meeting a pleasant
one by organizing at least one social function.

I would like some recommended papers to read about compact
categories. Preferably accesible over the web for ease of getting hold
of. In particular,

- From a computational point of view, what are the arguments for and
against having such structure

- Examples of categories which are compact

- In Set, can we describe the relationship between initial algebras
and final coalgebras

I have long regarded it as "well known" that
    the partial map classifier for topological spaces or locales
where
    by "partial" I mean a continuous function defined on an open subset
is
    the Artin gluing, Freyd cover or scone (Sierpinski cone).

Can anybody point me to a published proof of this, or even tell me who
first proved it?  

The same construction, with frames replaced by the categories of contexts
and substitutions (a.k.a. classifying categories) for theories in other
fragments of logic,  has also been used with spectacular results to prove
consistency, strong normalisation, etc.   I know of plenty of work on
that application itself,   but I wonder whether anybody has investigated
the connection between these two applications of the construction.

PS Thanks to everyone who wrote to me about 1970s calculators.  I will be
writing back and summarising the responses for "categories" after the end
of term.   When the students have sat my exam paper (sometime in May)
I will also post to "categories" the actual question that I composed.

Abd-Allah and I dealt with this in

 ``A compact-open topology on partial maps with open domain'', {\em J. London
Math Soc.} (2) 21 (1980) 480-486.

as a development of work with Peter Booth in

 ``Spaces of partial maps, fibred mapping spaces and the compact-open
topology'', {\em Gen. Top. Appl.} 8 (1978) 181-195.

We got the idea of representability of partial maps from Peter Freyd's
article on topos theory. Is there an earlier result on these lines?

Ideas on making spaces over B into a Cartesian closed category came initially
from a paper of Rene Thom, and were developed in Peter's work at Hull.  This
eventually suggested the topologisation of spaces of partial maps as a step
towards Top/B.

            http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/Caminha00/index.html


OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND

Programming languages are the basic tools with which all applications
of computers are built.  It is important, therefore, that they should
be well designed and well implemented. Achieving these goals requires
both a good theoretical understanding of programming language designs,
and practical skills in the development of high quality compilers.

The summer school is addressed to postgraduate students, researchers 
and industrials who want to learn about recent developments in programming 
language research, both in semantic theory and in implementation.

The programme will consist of introductory and advanced courses on the
following themes:  

- description of existing programming language features;

- design of new programming language features;

- implementation and analysis of programming languages;

- transformation and generation of programs;

- verification of programs.

LOCATION

The summer school is located in Caminha, a picturesque village by the 
sea and on the Rio Minho, on the northern border between Portugal and 
Spain.

We announce the availability of a Java application for storage and display
of finitely presented categories and functors among them.

The application is available for download at 
 http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/gdct/
and is also linked from 
 http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/

For Win9x/NT users, a single download provides the application along with
the required Java run-time environment. Installation is via InstallShield.
For other operating systems, download the Java archive for the application
and, separately, the appropriate Java run-time environment (to which
links are provided). 

We are interested in any response from users, and in expanding the
database of categories and functors available from the default server, so
we would be happy to receive examples from users. It is intended to
upgrade the application this summer, and so we would also appreciate
receiving any reports of difficulties in function or usability, as well as
suggestions for new functionality. 

The application allows for the creation, editing, display and storage of
finitely presented categories. Categories can be opened and saved from
local files as well as loaded from a specified server. Open categories can
be displayed graphically, and the graphical display can be manipulated (in
3 dimensions) and stored. Several tools for testing properties of objects
and arrows can be applied; in this version they include Make Confluent,
Equality of Composities, Make Dual, Initial Object, and Terminal Object.

Functors between stored categories can also be created and stored. Open
functors can be displayed and animated.

A built-in help system describes how to use the application. 

Graphical Database for Category Theory was developed in the summer of 1999
by Jeremy Bradbury and R. Rosebrugh with support from an NSERC Canada
undergraduate summer research assistantship.

Some of the algorithms used in GDCT were originally developed in A
Database of Categories, a C program written by Ryan Gunther and Michael
Fleming, and Category Theory Database Tools a Java applet, written by
Jeremy Bradbury, both under the supervision of R. Rosebrugh.

We hope that some of you will find GDCT useful and enjoyable. 

Bob Rosebrugh and Jeremy Bradbury

               Editors: J. Adamek, M. Escardo, M. Hofmann

The eighth conference on Category Theory and Computer Science
(CTCS'99) has been held in Edinburgh 10-12 September 1999. 

A special issue of the journal Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) will
be devoted to journal versions of papers presented at that conference
and other papers on the same topic.

Submissions will undergo the usual refereeing process for TCS; authors
of submissions are not required to have participated at CTCS'99. 

>From the call for papers: "The purpose of the conference series is the
advancement of the foundations of computing using the tools of
category theory.  While the emphasis is upon applications of category
theory, it is recognized that the area is highly
interdisciplinary. Topics of interest include but are not limited to
category-theoretic aspects of the following:

concurrent and distributed systems, constructive mathematics,
declarative programming and term rewriting, domain theory and
topology, linear logic, models of computation, program logics, data
refinement, and specification, programming language semantics, type
theory".

See also http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/ctcs99 for the conference
programme.

TITLE: Injective Hulls are not Natural
AUTHORS: J. Adamek, H. Herrlich, J. Rosicky and W. Tholen
ABSTRACT: In a category with injective hulls and a cogenerator, the 
embeddings into injective hulls can never form a natural transformation, 
unless all objects are injective. In particular, assigning to a field
its algebraic closure, to a poset or boolean algebra its MacNeille
completion, and to an R-module its injective envelope is not functorial, 
if one wants the respective embeddings to form a natural transformation.

Andrej Bauer asked whether large cardinals other than inaccessible ones
have a natural definition in topos theory.  Indeed, like most questions
of set theory which have an objective content, this too is independent
of the a priori global inclusion and membership chains which are
characteristic of the Peano conception that ZF formalizes. Various kinds
of "measurable" cardinals arise as possible obstructions to simple
dualities of the type considered in algebraic geometry.  Actually, 
measurable cardinals are those which canNOT be measured by smaller ones,
because of the existence on them of a type of homomorphism which is
equivalent to the existence of a measure in the sense of Ulam.
Specifically, let V be a fixed object and let M denote the monoid object
of endomorphisms of V.  Then the contravariant functor ( )^V is actually
valued in the category of left M-actions and as such has an adjoint which 
is the enriched hom of any left M-set into V.  The issue is whether the
composite of these, the double dualization, is isomorphic to the identity
on the topos;  if so, one may say that all objects are measured by V, or
that there are no objects supporting non-trivial Ulam elements.  In any
case, the double dualization monad obtained by composing seems to add new
ideal Ulam elements to each object, i.e. elements which cannot be nailed
down by V-valued measurements.  Since fixed points for the monad are
special algebras, and since algebras are always closed under products
etc., it should be possible to devise a very natural proof based on monad
theory that the category of these non-Ulam objects is itself a topos and
even "inaccessible" relative to the ambient topos.
     Why is the above definition relevant?  The first example should be
the topos of finite sets with V a three-element set.  There the monad is
indeed the identity, as can be seen by adapting results of Stone and Post.
Extending the same monad to infinite sets, we obtain the Stone-Czech
compactification beta.
     The key example is a topos of sets in which we have V a fixed
infinite set.  As Isbell showed in 1960, the category contains no Ulam
cardinals in the usual sense if and only if the monad described above is
the identity.
     Further  examples involve the complex numbers as V, where actually M
can be taken to consist only of polynomials, with the same result;  this
example extends nicely from discrete sets to continuous sets, usually
discussed in the context of "real compactness".  Another kind of example
concerns bornological spaces.  The result always seems to be that the lack
of Ulam cardinals is equivalent to the exception-free validity of basic
space/quantity dualities.  
     Ulam (and other set theorists since) usually in effect phrase the
construction in terms of a two-element set V equipped however with
infinitary operations.  Isbell's remark shows that equivalently an
infinite set equipped with finitary (indeed only unary) operations can
discern the same distinctions between actual elements as values of the
Dirac-type adjunction map and ghostly Ulam elements on the other hand.

INVITED TALK:
Automated Verification = Graphs, Automata, and Logic

Moshe Y. Vardi
Rice University

In automated verification one uses algorithmic techniques to
establish the correctness of the design with respect to a given
property. Automated verification is based on a small number of
key algorithmic ideas, tying together graph theory, automata
theory, and logic. In this self-contained talk I will describe how
this "holy trinity" gave rise to automated-verification tools.

--------------------
INVITED TALK:
Planning with State Models, MDPs and POMDPs:
A general framework for planning and control in AI

Hector Geffner
Depto de Computacion
Universidad Simon Bolivar
Caracas, Venezuela

We consider the problem of planning in a general setting
where actions can be deterministic, non-deterministic, or probabilistic,
and their effects can be fully or partially observable. The task is to
obtain
a  plan or closed-loop controller  given a suitable description
of the initial situation, actions, sensors,  and goals.

We approach this problem by distinguishing three elements:

- models (that help us to make the tasks mathematically precise)
- languages (that help us to state problems in a convenient way), and
- algorithms (that compute the desired solutions: plans, controllers, etc.)

We show that the models - State Models, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
and Partially Observable MDPs - can be conveniently described using
suitable logical action languages, and in many cases can be solved
by search algorithms that combine ideas from heuristic search and
dynamic programming.  We also present some empirical results,
and discuss limitations and challenges.

This is joint work with Blai Bonet.

What is meant by saying that an object is "injective" varies a bit 
from place to place. If it means that the object represents a 
contravariant functor that carries monics into epics and if one defines
an "injective hull" of an object  A  to mean

   a monic  A --> E  where  E  is injective and such that
   A --> E --> X  monic implies  E --> X is monic 

then there are non-trivial examples of functorial injective hulls: take
any poset with a top element and view it as a category; the only
injective object is the top and the unique map from any object to the
top is easily verified to be an injective hull.

Apparently, therefore, the meaning of injective is a mutation obtained
by changing the word "monic" in the above description to something
stronger, such as "extremal monic" or "regular monic". (In Cats and
Alligators the notions of projective and injective are not dual: a
co-projective would be the mutation of injective obtained by using
extremal monics.)

If the strengthening of monic is such that it becomes an iso whenever
epic (as is the case with extremal and regular), then there's an easy
proof of the impossibility of functoriality, with or without a
cogenerator.

In the days when all categories were abelian (that is, in the days
when people actually talked about injective hulls) it was also the 
case that all monic-epics were isos, and this easy proof was a pretty
standard exercise. It goes as follows. Suppose that  E  is a functor,
u  a natural transformation from the identity functor to  E  such that
u:A --> E(A)  is an injective hull for all  A. We wish to show that  u
is epic.

If  B  is injective then there must be  E(B) --> B  such that 
B --> E(B) --> B  is the identity map. The definition of injective 
hull forces  E(B) --> B  to be monic which, in turn, forces  u_B  to
be an iso. We may replace  E  with a naturally equivalent functor with
the property that  u_B  is the identity map whenever  B  is injective.

For an arbitrary  A  consider

                               u
                           A ---> E(A)
                      
                        u  |       |  E(u)
                               1
                         E(A) --> E(A)
                      
                      E(u) |       |  E(u)
                               1
                         E(A) --> E(A)


and conclude that  E(u)  is an idempotent. Using again (and for the 
last time) the definition of injective hull we have that  E(u)  is
monic. The only monic idempotent is the identity map.

                 u        x           u        y
Suppose that  A --> E(A) --> C  =  A --> E(A) --> C. Consider

              u                              u
          A ---> E(A)                    A ---> E(A)
                                    
       u  |       |  1                u  |       |  1
              1                              1
        E(A) --> E(A)                  E(A) --> E(A)
                                    
       x  |       |  E(x)             y  |       |  E(y)
              u                              u
          C ---> E(C)                    C ---> E(C)


If one considers just the outer rectangles one sees that the left hand
verticals are the same, hence so must be the right hand verticals.
But  u  is monic, thus  E(x) = E(y)  implies   x = y.

Peter,

Jirka Adamek had prepared a draft response to your earlier remark that a poset
with top element should disprove the assertion in the Abstract of our paper
(with Herrlich and Rosicky) which he had circulated. His response is attached
below, slightly edited by me - hence I take full responsibility for its
contents.

Our proof of the Theorem adds only one twist to the proof you have just
circulated: monomorphisms get substituted by an absolutely ARBITRARY class H of
morphisms;  H-injective then indeed means that the contravariant hom sends H to
epis; and H-essential is as you described as well (: an h in H such that g.h is
in H only if g is in H). We are able to compensate for the loss of mono through
condition 1, while condition 2 obviously replaces your (epi&mono is iso). For
full details, please consult the paper.

Best wishes,
Walter.


=============================================================================
Dear Peter,
The precise result we prove in our paper is the following:

Theorem. Let  H  be a class of morphisms in a category  C  such that
1. all H-injective objects form a cogenerating class, and
2. the class of all H-essential morphisms which are epimorphic
	is precisely the class of isomorphisms of  C .
Then C cannot have natural H-injective hulls (i.e. they cannot
form an endofunctor together with a natural transformation from Id)
unless every object in  C  is H-injective.

The abstract we have given in our posting was meant to be an abbreviation of
this precise statement. While condition 1 holds true for the set H of all
(mono)morphisms in a poset with top element, condition 2 fails.

Best regards,
J.A., H.H., J.R., W.T.

Walter wrote "We are able to compensate for the loss of mono through
condition 1". Wouldn't it be simpler just to say that condition 1 
implies that everything in  H  is a monomorphisms?
                                              x        y
(Let  A --> B  be an  H-morphism  and let  X --> A, X --> A  be such
         x                 y
that  X --> A --> B  =  X --> A --> B. If  x  were  different from
y  then there would be   A --> E, E  an  H-injective object, so that
   x                                  y
X --> A --> E  were different from X --> A --> E.  But there would
have to be  B --> E  such that  A --> E  =  A --> B --> E  and 
    x                                            y
 X --> A --> B  would have be different from  X --> A --> B.)


So H-morphism is a strengthening of monic and that put's us back to
the situation I outlined:

  If the strengthening of monic is such that it becomes an iso
  whenever epic then there's an easy proof of the impossibility of
  functoriality, with or without a cogenerator.

 But by contrast, functorial injective resolutions do exist, usually
by some sort of double-dualisation monad. What if the "hull" or minimality
requirement is imposed on the process qua functor instead of at each
object? Do such functors exist ?

Good point, I did not see that! So the whole thing boils down to a very simple
observation on pointed endofunctors (which is certainly well-known for
reflectors): suppose you have an endofunctor F and a natural transformation
u:Id --> F which is pointwise monic; then, if Fu is pointwise epic, u itself is
pointwise epic. Proof:

        u_A     x,y
     A ---> FA ---> B
     |       |      |
 u_A |  u_FA |      | u_B
     |       |      |
     FA --> FFA --> FB
        Fu_A   Fx,Fy

( xu = yu gives Fx.Fu = Fy.Fu, hence Fx = Fy and then ux = uy and x = y.)


Coming back to injectivity: if u was pointwise an H-injective hull, then both
uF and Fu must be isos (independently of H being a class of monos or not!).
Hence, if H is a class of monos, the statement above applies.

This is just to give different point of view to the problem.

1. Suppose we have a category C and a full subcategory H (think of H  as a
subcategory of injective objects). Suppose we have  a functor E:C --> H
together with natural transformation
              i: Id --> E(C)
such that i is monic and ,moreover, E is weak left adjoint to the inclusion
functor H --> C. Then I claim that under two additional conditions E is
genuine adjoint and i is unit of the adjunction. The conditions are:

a. the natural transformation i is identity on H.
b. E preseves monics.

The proof is just a repetition of P.Freyd proof. We have to prove that
the extension in the diagram

           i:A --> E(A)
             |     /
           f |    /
             |   /
              I

is unique for any morphism f and "injective" I.
By applying E to this diagram and using  condition a) we see that it is
sufficient  to prove that E(i) is identity. Repeating Freyd's proof we see
that
E(i) is idempotent. Using  condition b) we conclude  that it is identity.

The conditions a) and b) are obviously satisfied in the case when E is
"injective hull functor" (of coarse a) is true up to iso, again see P,Freyd
proof).

As the unit of the adjunction is monic so the functor E reflects
epimorphisms. If in C we have that mono + epi implies iso we finally have
that i is iso and ,hence, the result of Adamek, Herrlish, Rosicky and
Tholen.

2. I would not dare to simply repeat P.Freyd argument if I don't have another
   proof (in a special but important  case). The proof is much more
techniqual but I believe reflects another interesting side of the problem
of functoriality
of injective resolutions.

Consider the following bicategory.
  The objects are categories enriched in the closed monoidal category of
(say bounded ) chain complexes.
  The 1-arrows are enriched distributors.
  The 2-arrows are homotopy classes of "coherent" natural transformations (i.e.
we localize the category of natural transformations with respect to the
class of morphisms which are level quaziisomorphisms).
  We have to define the composition of 1-arrows. This requires some techniques
but in a few words the result is left derived functor of the composition of
enriched distributors.

The resulting bicategory is closed on the left and right. Now, for a chain
functor
 K: A --> B
we can consider the right Kan extension of it along itself in the above
bicategory (codensity monad). The Kleisli category of it is called "strong
shape theory of K" Ssh_K. It is possible to prove, that:
 c). If K is a full embedding and has an enriched left adjoint then Ssh_K
is just a Kleisli category of the corresponding monad on B.

 d). If B is the category of chain complexes (say bounded)in an abelian
category with enough injectives and A is full subcategory of injective
chain complexes, then homology  of Ssh_K(X,Y) are isomorphic to the right
derived functor of internal Hom of B. In particular, if X and Y are
concentrated in the dimension 0 the cohomology are just the correspobding
Ext's.

 Coming back to the original problem. If H\in C are abelian and satisfy the
conditions a),b) then, according to our calculations
the inclusion
          K:  Ch(H) ---> Ch(C)
has a right adjoint and , hence,(by point c)
Ssh_K(X,Y) = Hom(X,E(Y))
for X,Y concentrated in dimension 0. Hence by d) the injective dimension of
C is 0 and we have the result again.

 Another words the injective dimension is the obstruction for nonnaturality
of the injective hull.

The same sort of theory can be developed for simplicial (or Cat) enriched
situation see
Batanin.M, Categorical Strong Shape THeory, Cahiers de Topologie et Geom,
v,XXXVIII-1(1997)p. 3-66.

I think some other results of nonaturality (as , for example, the result of
Shakhmatov mentioned by AHRT on p.8) are related to these strong shape
categories.

No it is not true. For example, the function defined by:

  f(x) =  if  x  is irrational then  0  else
          if  x =  p/q  where  p  and  q  are co-prime then  q.

In the community investigating coalgebras of functors F: K-> K (i.e.,
comma-categories Id/F ) the following condition in case  K = Set is 
quite often used:

Definition: A set functor is called bounded if there exists a cardinal
k  such that for every element  a  of every coalgebra there exists
a subcoalgebra of cardinality less than  k  containing  a . ("Bounded
at  k " is used  for the given  k.)

So I wondered how this is related to accessibility, and here is the answer:

Proposition: A set functor is bounded iff it is accessible.

In fact, if  k  is an infinite, regular cardinal, then k-accessible = 
bounded at  k . For, suppose that  F  is bounded at  k , then we
prove that in the usual category of elements of  F  for every object  
(A,a) there exists a morhpism  m: (B,b) -> (A,a) with  card B  < k .
It then follows easily that  F  is k-accessible (see e.g. 2.17 in the book
of Rosicky and myself). We can assume  A  nonempty, and choose  x  in  A.
Let p:A -> FA be the coalgebra given by the constant map to  a . There
exists a subcoalgebra m: (B,q) -> (A,p) for some  q: B -> FB with
card B < k  such that  x = m(y) for an element  y  of  B . Then                 b = q(y) clearly fulfills a = Fm(b), as requiered.
Conversely, suppose that  F  is k-accessible. Given a coalgebra  
p: A -> FA , consider the collection  m_i: A_i -> A  of all subsets
of cardinality less than  k  . Since  F  preserves k-directed unions,
for each  i  there exists an i' such that m_i  is contained in  m_i'
and  the image of p.m_i  is contained in that of Fm_i' . After
iterating i -> i' -> (i')' ... k times we find a  j  such that
m_i  is contained in  m_j , and  the image of  p.m_j  is contained in that
of Fm_j. The latter means that  p  can be restricted to  p_j: A_j -> FA_j
forming a subcoalgebra of the coalgebra above. Since every element of
FA  is contained in the image of some  Fm_i , this proves that  F  is
bounded at  k .

How about the following?

f(x) = 0 if x is irrational and

f(a/b) = a, where a/b is a fraction in lowest terms

Certainly within any open interval, there are rationals of arbitrarily large
numerator.

For a function that is not bounded above or below, how about:

f(x) = 0 if x is irrational

f(a/b) = a if b is even

f(a/b) = -a if b is odd

spontaneous was NO. Unfortunately I cannot find a counter-example to

 The real fun is about a function f such that
 f is unbounded in any open interval (c,d), and
 in addition to that:     f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y).

Using AC/Zorn's Lemma, we can construct 2^(2^Aleph_0) such functions,
as follows.  Let B be a basis for the reals R as a rational vector
space.  Clearly, |B| = 2^Aleph_0.  For any non-empty proper subset C
of B, let g be its characteristic function (g(x)=1 if x in C, g(x)=0
otherwise) and let f be the unique linear extension of g to R.  Then f
is linear, and its graph is dense in R^2, since, if c and d are such
that g(c)=1 and g(d)=0, then f(qc+rd) = q for all rationals q,r, and r
can be varied to make qc+rd as close as desired to any given real.

Max and Mike both mentioned that there are addition-preserving
self-maps on the reals that are unbounded on every non-trivial
interval. But such examples require the axiom of choice. In a
different context I happened to mention that just two months ago:

  Do we need the axiom of choice? If, instead, we add the axiom of 
  measurability, then the counterexamples disappear: let  f  be a 
  measurable midpoint-preserving map from  R  to  R;  we can easily
  specialize to the case that  f0 = 0, hence  f  is a measurable group
  endomorphism; for any real  a  consider the induced group 
  homomorphism from  R/aZ  to  R/(fa)Z;  any measurable group
  character is continuous and that's enough to force  f  to be
  continuous. (28 Jan)

The example that Michael Wendt and I described (well, almost the same
example) we didn't need choice but we did need -- as all good
toponomers know -- the law of excluded middle for the equality
predicate on the reals (in the category of spatial sheaves over a
perfect space it is the case that all real-valued maps from a closed
interval are, indeed, bounded.)

Bill's question concerning minimal functorial injective extensions
seems very interesting. Bill's comment was:

I have two different answers:
1. NO in case of Pos (and order-embeddings): there does not exist a minimal
pair (F,f) consisting of an endofunctor  F  of Pos whose values are
complete lattices and a natural transformation  f: Id -> F  whose
components are order-embeddings
2. YES in case of Set (and monomorphisms): the embedding  Id -> Id + K,
where  K  is the constant functor with value 1 , is minimal.

                               Accommodations

In 2000, ICALP will be held in the old campus of the University of Ge=
neva.
The hotels listed below have reserved a block of rooms at special ICA=
LP
rates. The discounted rates offered by the Hotel du Midi, a very pres=
tigious
4 star establishment, are an especially good value.

Prices for the hotels are guaranteed but due to the high demand of ro=
oms
during the month of July in Geneva, register as early as possible to =
assure
your choice. The hotels are within 5-15 minutes walking distance from=
 the
University of Geneva campus.

To reserve accommodations, contact the selected hotel, preferably, by=
 fax

                            Local Transportation

>From the airport:
A taxi from the airport to either hotels or University will cost abou=
t CHF
30. Alternatively you may take the train from the airport to the main=
 train
station - a 5 minute walk from the first two hotels. The ride will co=
st
around CHF 5 and will take 10 minutes. Purchase a ticket before board=
ing the
train.

>From hotels to the University:
It is a 10 minute walk from the first two hotels. You may cross the r=
iver
via either the Pont des Bergues or Pont de la Machine and then take R=
ue de
la Corraterie to Place Neuve. From the other hotel is a very short wa=
lk, see
the enclosed map. The University is located at the park called Promen=
ade des
Bastions.

By public transportation, take tramway number 13 from the main train =
station
to the fourth stop (called Plainpalais). From there walk by rue du Co=
nseil
G=E8n=E8ral until you reach the Promenade des Bastions.

Note: When using any local transportation, you need to purchase a tic=
ket in
advance at the machine located at the bus stop; the cost is CHF 2.20.=
 This
ticket is valid for one hour and you may take as many connections as =
you
want. Also note that the machine does not give change, and if you ent=
er a
bus without a valid transportation ticket you risk being required to =
pay a
fine of about CHF 100 and a visit to the police station.


                                  Cuisine

At ICALP '2000, luncheon will be served on the University campus to a=
ll
registrants on all five days and refreshments will be available durin=
g
breaks. On Thursday evening, there will be the official banquet of th=
e
conference. Please be sure to indicate on your registration form whet=
her you
prefer vegetarian meals.

At other times, participants will have a broad choice of dining optio=
ns
offering international and gourmet fare all within walking distance o=
f
accommodations and many along the shores of Lake Geneva. The traditio=
nal and
most popular dishes among the local population are cheese fondue and
raclette, delicious local wines, and lake perch.


                         Currency and Credit Cards

The unit of currency is the Swiss franc (CHF). Notes are issued in
denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 1,000. Coins are issued in
denominations of 5, 10, and 20 centimes, and .5, 1, 2, and 5 Swiss fr=
ancs.
At the moment of the print, 1US was worth CHF 1.67, but since this ra=
te
changes very often, check the real rate at the necessary moment. Most
hotels, large stores, restaurants, and petrol stations accept all maj=
or
credit cards (American Express, MasterCard, Visa, Diners Club, Euroca=
rd).


                                  Location

Geneva is situated along the banks of Lac L=E9man (Lake Geneva) and L=
e Rh=F4ne.
The lake showcases the plumed fountain Jet d'Eau, and various distric=
ts of
Geneva are connected by bridges across the waterways. The University =
of
Geneva where ICALP '2000 will convene is located on the `Left Bank' o=
ff
Place Neuve and along the Promenade des Bastions near the Old Town se=
ction
of Geneva.

The two first ICALP designated hotels (Noga and du Midi) are located
lakeside - on the `Right Bank' - and are within walking distance of t=
he
University campus. It is a 10-15 minute walk which crosses through `O=
ld
Town'. Also, there is regular bus service running to the University, =
so
ICALP participants may come and go throughout the day. The Hotel Le G=
renil
and the University are both situated on the `Left Bank' and are very =
close.
Geneva is a city of water parks and gardens and welcoming walkways wh=
ich
encourage exploration of the historical sites, museums, and internati=
onal
business and shopping districts. The University of Geneva is located =
near
`Old Town' an area dotted with sidewalk cafes, student life, and buil=
ding
antiquities dating back to the 5th century.

Geneva is a crossroads situated in the heart of Europe and linked to =
the
world by a vast network of motorways, airlines and railways. For thos=
e
planning to attend ICALP'2000 in Geneva, it is an excellent opportuni=
ty to
organize short trips into the countryside of charming villages and
vineyards. Tours to please all ages and interests are available inclu=
ding
afternoon train excursions, shopping cruises on Lake Geneva and The R=
hone,
and bus and cablecar trips in the Alps.

For some, the most inviting attraction will be mountain climbing. The=
 high
mountains are situated less than half an hour drive from Geneva. In e=
arly
July, a very popular and almost mandatory activity is swimming in the=
 lake
Geneva, so serious and not so serious swimmers should plan accordingl=
y!


                                  Climate

The climate in early July should be warm but still very pleasant with=
 nice
evenings and breezes off the Lake. There may be showers but we can al=
so
expect sunny days.


                            Passports and Visas

A valid passport is required for entry into Switzerland. Some nationa=
ls may
also require a visa for Switzerland, and if you plan to visit France =
one may
be required there. Please check with your travel agent or consulate t=
o
determine whether a visa will be required.
