  Since noone seems to have found an already-existing standard 
(the terminology ``Delta set'' suffers from the fact that the standard notation
for the usual simplicial category (with degeneracies) is $\Delta$),
here is a suggestion: ``facial sets''. This is somewhat like ``face complex'' 
but could apply to other objects eg ``facial groups'' etc...

> how to build a cartesian closed category with one object ?

By the letter of the law, a CCC has finite products, including a terminal
object, which is therefore the only object, and its only morphism is the
identity.

By the spirit of the question, there is such a thing as a CCC with one
interesting object D, and one boring one, the terminal object.

What you want, therefore, is [a full subcategory of] a category with an
object D such that
                                       D
		D x D   =    D    =   D

where of course "=" denotes isomorphism, not equality, and the two maps
that form this isomorphism encode a lot of interesting structure.

This structure is known as "the untyped lambda calculus with surjective
pairing", and Dana Scott famously showed how to construct such objects
in the early 1970s.

Joachim Lambek and *Philip* Scott ("Intro to higher order categorical logic")
have a nice discussion that goes from the question of a two-object CCC to
the lambda calculus.

Any account of domain theory will tell how more ways than the world ever
needed to know of constructing these models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

New PhD Positions    (DEADLINE 1 March 2000! See "How to apply" below.)

Department of Computing Science,
Chalmers University of Technology and Göteborgs University,
Sweden

The Department has about 60 researchers, half being faculty members
and half PhD students. Our focus is on programming logic and type
theory, functional programming, formal methods, distributed and
concurrent systems, security, algorithms, and computational
linguistics, but research is not restricted to these topics.  For more
information, see www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research.

PhD positions are for 5 years. There is no tuition fee. A PhD position
is a regular job with social benefits; the salary amounts to 16200 SEK
per month in the first year (the exact amount depends on teaching
duties, usually 20% of your time), which offers a higher standard of
living than for most PhD students elsewhere.

Knowledge of Swedish is not a prerequisite for application. English is
our working language for research. Both Swedish and English are used
in undergraduate courses.  Half of our researchers are native Swedes;
the rest come from more than 20 different countries.

Applicants must have an undergraduate degree in Computing Science or
in a related subject with a strong Computing Science component. You
may also apply if you expect to have such a degree by September 2000.
The School especially welcomes female applicants.

How to apply
------------

First, immediately register your intention to apply using the
electronic application form on the WWW at

  http://www.md.chalmers.se/Jobs/PhD/phd-00-en.thtml

The full application should give

  1 name, age, gender, nationality, post and email address, tel/fax no.
  2 transcripts of grades from your undergraduate degree(s); 
  3 a statement of research interests;

  5 copies of any scientific papers you have written.

Send it (paper mail) to

  Section for Mathematics and Computer Science
  Chalmers University of Technology
  412 96 Gothenburg
  Sweden

to arrive by 1 March 2000.  You will know the result of your
application by 1 June 2000.

Formal papers might take time. Meanwhile, e-mail will do perfectly
well for the information content of your application. Send it to

   prasad@cs.chalmers.se

This will be of particular help should you be unable to send in
complete information to the Section by 1 March.

(apologies for multiple copies)

This workshop follows last year's "Geometric and Topological Methods in
Concurrency Theory" meeting held at Aalborg University. The aim is to bring
together researchers that apply geometric, topological and algebraic topological

methods to formalize and analyze dynamical, concurrent and distributed systems.

The spirit of the meeting will be informal and will focus on exchange
of information and discussion.  It will consist of a number of tutorials,
invited
talks, together with accepted papers. Abstracts and work in progress
reports are encouraged. The submission deadline is the 19th of may.

     In Chapter 5 "Categories of Functors", there is Section 5 entitled
"The Specification of Functions". To me this is pretty interesting and
neat stuff!! I have some thoughts, questions, etc. which I will now
enumerate:

1) The method of specification defined in this section seems to be
essentially a rewrite system, i.e. we do a series of rewrites or
reductions on "data" (actually a certain kind of path in a Data graph)
until we possibly terminate. Hence the finite set of Equation that
Walters' describes is basically a set of rewrite rules, i.e.  one-way
rules in Rewriting Systems parlance.

2)  We have  two sets of Data paths that define the domain and codomain, 
respectively::
       - The Domain is respresented by a set of paths starting  at Data 
graph's "I" node and  ending at "J" node
      - The Codomain is represented by a set of paths starting at the Data 
graph's "I" node and ending at the "K" node
      Question: I guess using "I" for both Domain and Codomain is just a 
clever way of partitioning some of the possible paths of the Data graph into 
one set of paths representing Domain and another set of paths representing 
the Codomain (of course these sets can be the same!)???? I.e. we could
have chosen a different mechanism that I, J, K, yes???

3) On pg. 118, there is a "Note" about work that Robie Gates did to show
that we can achieve Turing completeness with this method of function
specfication.i.e. we can compute all parial recursive functions from N to
N. Hence the computation may not be terminating!!!! Otherwise, we would
not have Turing completeness and could solve Halting problem.

     Also mentioned in this Note is that not only are we not guaranteed
total functions (hence possibly partial functions), but we may also be
computing a relation.

     - Question: what restrictions must we put on the finite set Equation
to guarantee confluence???? I.e. computing a function and not computing a
relation???  Probably the answer to this is in a book on Rewriting Systems
or maybe Dershowitz paper.


4) Also it seems that Walters' approach of functional/relational
specification, could be looked at in terms of equational reasoning. I.e.
if we have a "specfied arrow" f: J -> K and lambda, a path from I to J and
epsilon, a path belonging to I to K, then Equation |- (f.lambda, epsilon).
Yes???


5) Finally and important to me, has work been continued by anyone else in
this area?? I don't see any papers in Walters' groups archive!! This
approach to function (and relation) specification is pretty spiffy from a
theoritcal viewpoint, but it seems it could be used as a basis to do
functional programming or even logic programming (computing relations) by
specifying the programs graphically!!

Bill Halchin

Yes. Indeed as part of my Ph.D. dissertation I wrote a complete specification
of the interpreter in ASF+SDF, a rewrite rule-based system for algebraic
specifications used at the University of Amsterdam. It can execute programs
of that kind. I can send it to you if you want so. The interpreter is
partially described also in the following papers:

the ASF+SDF95 workshop on generating tools from algebraic specifications.

Of course (the book is a bit confusing about this issue). Turing completeness
is proved in

Nicoletta Sabadini, Sebastiano Vigna, and Robert F.C. Walters. A note on
recursive functions. Math. Struct. Comp. Sci., 6:127-139, 1996.

and BSS (real numbers computability) completeness is proved in 

Sebastiano Vigna. On the relations between distributive computability and the
BSS model. Theoret. Comput. Sci., 162:5-21, 1996.

Not to my knowledge, but you should ask Bob Walters directly.

The Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia
in cooperation with the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences
is hosting the Foundational Methods in Computer Science workshop
on June 1st - 4th, 2000, on the University of British Columbia
Campus in Vancouver, B.C., Canada

The workshop is an informal meeting to bring together researchers
in mathematics and computer science with a focus on the application 
of category theory in computer science. It is a three day meeting, 
that starts off with a day of tutorials aimed at students and 
newcomers to category theory, followed by a day and a half of
research talks. There will be a series of invited presentations
(TBA). The remaining research talks are solicited from the
participants. Student participation is particularly encouraged
at FMCS.

Hi,

As you know John Isbell is still recovering from the major illness he
suffered last year.  He is in a rehab center and has made remarkable
progress.  There is still a long way to go before he will be released. 
There is very little mental stimulation in these facilities.  If you can
spare the time, a visit would be wonderful.  If that is not possible,
I'm sure a note would be welcome.  Anything to break up the sameness of
the days.  The address is:

Harris Hill Nursing Facility
2699 Wehrle Dr.
Williamsville  NY  14221

(This mail has been sent to category theorists visiting Louvain-La-Neuve
in April this year, participants of the "Workshop on categorical methods
in algebra and topology" in Nassogne, organized last year by F. Borceux,
and participants of the recent "PSSL 71" at Louvain-La-Neuve  ---  please
feel free to forward it to anyone that might be interested.)
     The research unit Foundations of Exact Sciences of the Free
University of Brussels, active in axiomatic quantum theory/logic,
organizes its annual workshop on "Operational Quantum Logic" the week of
April 10-14. This year's main theme will be the role of quantales in, and
categorical aspects of quantum logic. 
     Motivated by the large number of visiting category theorists in  
Louvain-La-Neuve and workshop participants in Brussels in that period, and 
the non-empty intersection of their research domains, we have, after 
consulting Francis Borceux, decided to organize a

        "Category Theory Symposium" in Brussels, 
             the weekend of April 8-9, 2000

as a satellite of our workshop on quantum logic.
     The style of the meeting will be essentially inspired by the PSSL 
meetings, although we don't use that name since there has been an earlier
announcement of a "PSSL" in Braunschweig taking place later in April. We
would very much appreciate your participation in the "Category theory
symposium", convinced as we are of the benefit of interaction between the
researchers of our respective domains! 

As location for the "Category theory symposium" we have chosen for the 
homebase of an artists-collective, which is a actually a 'swimming pool 
with no water' in Vorst (Fôret), Brussels - the artists are looking 
forward to the encounter with mathematicians and are (allready now) 
showing signs of inspiration.

As provisional program we propose the following:
- Saturday (April 8): 9.30h  Welcome in Vorst (F™ret), Brussels;
                      10.00h Start lectures;
                      13.00h Lunch offered by us;
                      14.30h Some more lectures;
                      19.30h Dinner offered by us.
- Sunday (April 9):   10.00h Lectures;
                      13.00h Lunch, outing and tourism in Brussels.

Please let us know if you are interested in: 
attending and/or giving a talk at the "Category Theory Symposium" 
(or if you might want to participate in the workshop on "Operational
Quantum Logic: quantum logic/quantales/categories'', the week after), 
by mailing to any of the following:
- The organizers:
Bob Coecke; bocoecke@vub.ac.be 
Steven Sourbron; ssourbro@vub.ac.be
Frank Valckenborgh; fvalcken@vub.ac.be
- Their "partner in crime" in Louvain-La-Neuve:
Isar Stubbe; i.stubbe@agel.ucl.ac.be

This meeting and the quantum logic/quantale workshop is supported by

The flat cover conjecture was formulated by E. Enochs in 1981
and asks whether every module has a flat cover. In his paper,
he also showed that it is equivalent to weak coreflectivity
of flat modules in modules. In 1995, J. Xu has proved that
it is true over commutative noetherian rings of finite Krull
dimension. The flat cover conjecture has been recently proved
(over an arbitrary ring) by L. Bican, R. El Bashir and E. Enochs.
In a paper "Flat covers and factorizations", I am giving a purely 
categorical proof based on the theorem of J. Smith about weak 
factorization systems.

You may be amused trying to prove it (it is not easy), but a category in
which every morphism has a unique quasi-inverse (AfE!g fgf=f) is a
groupoid.  It is actually a theorem about semigroups, but the proof works
just as well for categories.  (You can add an identity without affecting

Dear category list,

Mike's exercise: Suppose C is a category with the following
property. For all f there exists a unique g such that fgf=f.
Prove: C is a groupoid.

Here's a short argument: Note that fgf=f implies we have two
idempotents, namely gfgf=gf and fgfg=fg. So as a special
case, suppose ff = f. The uniqueness of g such that fgf=f
together with the fact that fff=ff=f and f1f=ff=f implies
that f=g=1. So the only idempotents are the identity maps.
Therefore, also, gf=1 and fg=1.

>From Todd Wilson, I learned that adding identities is not so harmless.  
So suppose only that there are objects, arrows, source and target and
arrows that compose associatively only when source matches target.  With
identities, you can conclude, for any idempotent e, from eee = e1e, that e
= 1 and that makes it trivial.

 Apologies if you have already seen this.]


=========================================================================

                      Two Research Positions Available
                                      
          Department of Informatics, University of Potsdam, Germany
                                      
   The Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Group at the University of
   Potsdam offers two research positions within the project ``Nonmonotonic
   inference systems for reasoning with conflictual rules''. Apart from
   the development and implementation of corresponding reasoning
   techniques, a particular emphasis lies on the integration of flexible
   conflict resolution mechanisms that are in turn applied to modeling
   conflictual knowledge bases found in linguistics.
   
   The project is part of the Research Group ``Conflictual rules'' (in
   German: Forschergruppe ``Konfligierende Regeln''), funded by the German
   Science Foundation (DFG). This research group offers an
   interdisciplinary context comprising adjacent research projects from
   Linguistics, Psychology, Physics, and Informatics.
   
   Applicants must hold a master's degree (Diplom, DEA, or equivalent) and
   should preferably have a PhD in Informatics/Computer Science or
   Mathematics, although a PhD project is also conceivable. A suitable
   candidate is expected to have good communication skills (though fluency
   in German is not required) and research experience in at least one
   area, relevant to logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning,
   eg. nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming, automated deduction,
   argumentation systems, deductive databases, etc. However, highly
   motivated and academically strong applicants interested in getting into
   nonmonotonic reasoning/logic programming are also encouraged to apply.
   
   The positions are available immediately; they will be filled for a
   period of up to 24+12 months in the first instance, with a likely
   extension by three additional years. Salary is according to the German
   BAT scale (Bat-O IIa), depending on age and family status.
   
   Candidates should send a curriculum vitae, a list of publications,
   references, and a statement of research interests to:

The disk on triples died yesterday.  If you send mail to barr@barrs.org or
to barr@math.mcgill.ca, it should arrive normally.  However, any mail sent
between 9AM and about 5PM yesterday will have been lost.  As will the 199
messages that were waiting for me to act on.  Included was at least one
referee's report and one journal submission that arrived while I was away
and I had left there to deal with when I got back.  Which I did Thursday
night, but I hadn't done anything by Friday at 9.  So if you sent me
anything important like that recently, please resend it.

We should have triples back in service by Monday or so, but whether we can
recover the information on the disk is not clear.

PERIPATETIC SEMINAR ON SHEAVES AND LOGIC

        73rd meeting - first announcement


The 73rd meeting of the seminar will be held at the Department of
Theoretical Computer Science of the Technical University in
Braunschweig, Germany, over the weekend of April 29-30, 2000.  Notice
that Monday, May 1, is a holiday in Germany.  The seminar welcomes
talks using or addressing category theory or logic, either explicitly
or implicitly, in the study of any aspect of mathematics or science.

Braunschweig is located about 60 km East of Hannover and can easily be
reached by car or train.  The closest airport is in Hannover; the
airport bus to the Hannover train station takes about 20 minutes, and
the train from there to Braunschweig takes about 40 minutes or less.
We will send further information on the location of the seminar, along
with details on local travel and accommodation to those who register,
at least a week before the meeting.

Hello, 

In his paper "Qualitative distinctions between some toposes of generalized
graphs" (Contemporary Mathematics Volume 92, 1989, pp. 261-299) Lawvere
mentions a "powerful theorem" that "justifies bypassing the complicated
considerations" usually associated with defining a smooth manifold (charts,
atlases, etc.). This is in the context of something called "closed under
splitting of idempotents" and the kind of idempotent he is talking about, I
think, is what you get if you embed a manifold in a sufficiently
high-dimensional space, wrap it inside and out with foam, call that foamy
thing an open set, and then the idempotent is the projection of the foam
back onto the embedded manifold. What I would like is a carefully written,
fully spelled out statement and proof of his theorem. Please advise.

In fact, I would be even more delighted by a more standard (motivation,
definition, theorem, proof) version of his entire paper, but I suppose that
is too much to ask. 

Please reply directly to me, at

Dear Colleagues,

Together with Robin Cockett and Robert Seely I would like to announce
the availablility of a preprint 

	Morphisms and modules for linear bicategories

that has been submitted for the CT99 proceedings.  You can get it from
<http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/RESEARCH/>.  

Those interested in some of the pictures I took at that meeting may want
to look at <http://www.iti.cs.tu-bs.de/TI-INFO/koslowj/PHOTOS/CT99-0/>.
If anybody wants his or her picture removed, or wants to order a print 
or a larger version of a picture, please let me know.

Abstract:

  Linear bicategories are a generalization of bicategories, in which
  the horizontal composition of 1-cells is replaced by two (coherently
  linked) horizontal compositions.  This notion combines and
  integrates compositional features typical of bicategories with those
  arising from linear logic.  Linear bicategories, therefore, provide
  a natural categorical semantics and interpretation for (relational)
  non-commutative linear logic.  In particular, the logical notion of
  negation (or complementation) turns into a linear notion of
  adjunction, with involutive negations corresponding to cyclic linear
  adjunctions.  The latter are crucial for the construction of a
  tricategory of linear bicategories, linear functors, linear
  transformations and linear modifications.

  This paper first develops the structure of the afore-mentioned
  tricategory and describes how the various components have a natural
  interpretation using the diagrammatic calculus of circuits.  Then we
  transfer the module construction to the linear setting, which leads
  to a new linear bicategory of linear monads, linear modules, and
  module transformations over a given linear bicategory.  This lives
  in a tricategory where the 1-cells are given by linear functors that
  are strict on units.  The connections of this construction with the
  nucleus construction for linear bicategories are indicated at the end.
  
  The present paper is primarily expository, setting out the notions
  necessary for the development of category theory enriched in a
  linear bicategory.

Due to the recent hard disk failure on triples, I have lost the
current electronic mailing list for notices of seminars of the
Montreal Category Theory group.  The seminar schedule is (as always)
available on the triples home page 
     http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples
so anyone interested in what talks are being given at McGill may check
there.  I will reconstruct the local mailing list, but if anyone wants
me to add their names to that list, and they are not presently in
Montreal, please email me, and I will do so.

This might be a good time to remind people that if emailing folks at
McGill, it is always best to use the format 
     user@math.mcgill.ca
rather than any variant using "triples" in the email address.  This
allows us to move things around as necessary, when crises strike.  It
may also be a good time to remind folks that all urls (including ftp)
that began "http://triples.math.mcgill.ca/" have been replaced by more 
generic "http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/" (for ftp, the standard
url is "ftp://ftp.math.mcgill.ca/pub/").  If you haven't updated your
links and bookmarks, please do so, since the old formats are no longer
supported.  If a McGill link fails to work, check to see if this is
the reason.

OK, I admit, this has nothing to do with category theory,
but maybe one of my mates out there can help me ...

Did any of the readers of "categories" own (or use) a 
programmable calculator in the 1970s?

I'm looking for something that would have done about 100 to 1000
instructions per second, with conditional instructions, loops
and indexed access to numbered memories.

The reason s that I want to set a exam question about elementary
ideas of complexity along the lines of "The XY99 calculator could
execute this algorithm for a problem size up to nnnn - how big
a problem could you solve today with your million-times faster
computer?".

Info about performance, price, the year it went on the market, etc
please, by direct email to me.

(OK, I'll summarise the responses I get in another message to
"categories".)

Bonjour,

Here is a short note about the globular homology.


Title : 
About the globular homology of higher dimensional automata

Abstract : 
In this short note, we introduce a new simplicial nerve of higher
dimensional automata whose homology groups yield a new definition of
the globular homology.  With this new definition, the drawbacks
noticed with the construction of  [Gau99] disappear.

Clark, David M.(1-SUNYP); Davey, Brian A.(5-LTRB)

summary) Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics, 57. Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge, 1998. xii+356 pp. $64.95. ISBN
0-521-45415-8

I began reading this book (conventionally enough) with the first two
paragraphs of the Preface:

  "In 1936 Marshall Stone published a truly novel theorem ... What
  Stone discovered was a representation for all Boolean algebras which
  gave algebraists a usable understanding of their structure, using
  topological spaces to construct the representations ... In fact,
  Stone proved much more than a representation theorem ... In modern
  language, he proved that the category of Boolean algebras is dually
  equivalent to the category of Boolean spaces ...".

Finding in these words what I presumed to be a conscious echo of the
words:

  "This book is about a particular theorem -- the Stone representation
  theorem for Boolean algebras -- and some of the mathematical
  consequences which have developed from it ... Stone's key idea was
  the introduction of topology ... this was a really bold idea ...
  Moreover, [Stone's representation formed] one of the earliest
  nontrivial examples of an equivalence of categories ..."

with which I had begun the Introduction to my own book Stone spaces,
published in the same C.U.P. series in 1982 [Cambridge Univ. Press,
Cambridge, 1982; MR 85f:54002], I naturally turned next to the
Bibliography to check that my book was listed there. After all, though
my book dealt with other subjects besides duality, it did have a whole
chapter devoted to dualities of the type studied by Clark and Davey,
and so it ought to be one of their standard references.

My name does not appear in the Bibliography. Indeed, its only
occurrence in the entire book is in the list of previous volumes in
the series which appears opposite the title page.

I mention this at the outset of this review, in order to give the
reader a fair chance to make allowance for what he may construe as
"sour grapes" on my part. For a related reason, I have departed from
Mathematical Reviews tradition by writing the review in the first
person; I cannot pretend to have achieved the standards of objectivity
and dispassionateness that would be implied by a third-person review.

However, it is not only the works of Johnstone which have been
overlooked by Clark and Davey. I looked next in the Bibliography for
John Isbell's ground-breaking 1972 paper on general functorial
semantics [Amer. J. Math. 94 (1972), 535--596; MR 53 #580], and his
later work characterizing concrete dualities in terms of commuting
subtheories of a ruled theory: neither is present, and Isbell is
represented only by a much less important 1980 paper on median
algebra. Again, the 1982 paper in which Harold Simmons coined the term
"schizophrenic object" [Topology Appl. 13 (1982), no. 2, 201--223; MR
83f:18006], for a set with two commuting algebraic structures, is not
there, although Clark and Davey freely use this term in their text.
Having discovered this, I began studying the Bibliography more
systematically, and soon realized its salient feature: all works
written by category-theorists, or making serious use of categorical
ideas, are excluded from it -- with the twin exceptions of Saunders
Mac Lane's classic Categories for the working mathematician [Springer,
New York, 1971; MR 50 #7275] (which, after all, the authors could
hardly have left out, given their indebtedness to his title), and of
Peter Freyd's 1966 paper on algebra-valued functors [Colloq. Math. 14
(1966), 89--106; MR 33 #4116] (to which I shall return below).

This, then, is a book on a categorical subject -- duality -- by
authors who are not category theorists, and presumably intended for
such a readership.  However, the editors of Mathematical Reviews have
asked a category-theorist to review it, so the review is written from
that point of view.

The subject of the book is the construction of dual equivalences, or
more generally contravariant adjunctions, between algebraic categories
$\scr A$ and categories $\scr X$ whose objects are compact topological
spaces equipped with compatible algebraic and/or relational structure.
Here one encounters the first restrictive feature of the authors'
outlook: for them "algebraic" means "finitary algebraic" (an attitude
already debunked by Marshall Stone in 1947), and so the idea of a
compact topology as a kind of algebraic structure (indeed, the
universal example of a structure which commutes with all finitary
structures) cannot be expressed. Nor can the concomitant "unity of
opposites" idea that $\scr A$ and $\scr X$ are two categories of the
same kind -- they are doomed to remain forever separate, like the
lovers on Keats's Grecian urn.

Clark and Davey follow the common tradition in universal algebra that
the underlying set of an algebra is not allowed to be empty. Having
thus amputated the initial objects from many of their categories 
$\scr A$, they are forced to amputate the terminal objects from the
dual categories $\scr X$, leading to unnecessary complications in the
descriptions of these categories as quasivarieties. Since they have
not amputated the terminal object from $\scr A$, they are forced (in
appropriate cases) to allow the empty space as a member of $\scr X$.
Thus, for them, a topological algebra does not necessarily have an
underlying discrete algebra!

As already mentioned, Clark and Davey make heavy use of schizophrenic
objects. However, as far as most of the book is concerned,
schizophrenic objects are simply a convenient ad hoc way of
constructing a contravariant adjunction; the fact that every
contravariant adjunction between categories of the type they consider
is induced by mapping into a schizophrenic object is not mentioned
until page 162, where it is ascribed (not altogether appropriately) to
the paper of Freyd mentioned earlier, and stated in such a convoluted
way as to be almost unrecognizable. Again, all the schizophrenic
objects the authors consider are finite (and topologically discrete);
thus, although they refer to Pontryagin duality in their Preface (and
Pontryagin appears, along with Birkhoff and Stone, as one of the three
mathematicians to whose memory the work is dedicated), they are able
to describe only the special case of Pontryagin duality for abelian
groups of some fixed finite exponent.

All the above criticisms are, in a sense, trivial ones; but their
cumulative effect is nontrivial. Category theory is often criticized
for consisting entirely of trivialities; but, as Freyd long ago
observed, its real function is to demonstrate that the trivial parts
of mathematics are trivial for trivial reasons, and that is a valuable
service which it performs for the mathematical community. Reading
Clark and Davey's book, anyone new to the field would find it
difficult or impossible to distinguish between the trivialities and
the results with genuine content, since the former are so often
presented in ad hoc ways that obscure the underlying pattern. This is
not a book that I would recommend a graduate student to read.

One might argue that the book's shortcomings are not of major
importance in relation to its declared purpose. After all, it contains
a wealth of detailed information on particular techniques for
establishing duality theorems, and "working algebraists" (read:
working universal-algebraists) will undoubtedly find it immensely
useful to have all these techniques collected together in one place. I
admit the force of that argument; but I also find it seriously
worrying, for it carries the implication that universal-algebraists
have given up the attempt to engage in dialogue with the rest of the
mathematical community. As the authors remark at the end of their
Preface, there is much that remains to be done in studying and
classifying concrete dualities; but this book is not likely to inspire
anyone outside the closed circle of universal-algebraists to take up
the task.

The following two papers on homotopy-algebraic structures - or "weakened"
algebraic structures, if you prefer - are now available.

The first one, "Up-to-Homotopy Monoids", is 8 pages long and is essentially
a set of notes for the talk I gave at the Louvain-la-Neuve PSSL in
October. It can serve as an introduction to the second one, "Homotopy
Algebras for Operads" (100 pages, but don't let that scare you: it should be
easy for category theorists). Abstracts are below.

"Up-to-Homotopy Monoids"

Informally, a homotopy monoid is a monoid-like structure in which properties
such as associativity only hold `up to homotopy' in some consistent way. This
short paper comprises a rigorous definition of homotopy monoid and a brief
analysis of some examples. It is a much-abbreviated version of the paper
`Homotopy Algebras for Operads', and does not assume any knowledge of
operads.

"Homotopy Algebras for Operads"

We present a definition of homotopy algebra for an operad, and explore its
consequences.

The paper should be accessible to topologists, category theorists, and anyone
acquainted with operads. After a review of operads and monoidal categories,
the definition of homotopy algebra is given.  Specifically, suppose that M is
a monoidal category in which it makes sense to talk about algebras for some
operad P. Then our definition says what a homotopy P-algebra in M is,
provided only that some of the morphisms in M have been marked out as
`homotopy equivalences'.

The bulk of the paper consists of examples of homotopy algebras. We show that
any loop space is a homotopy monoid, and, in fact, that any n-fold loop
space is an n-fold homotopy monoid in an appropriate sense. We try to
compare weakened algebraic structures such as A_infinity-spaces,
A_infinity-algebras and non-strict monoidal categories to our homotopy
algebras, with varying degrees of success. We also prove results on `change
of base', e.g. that the classifying space of a homotopy monoidal category is
a homotopy topological monoid. Finally, we reflect on the advantages and
disadvantages of our definition, and on how the definition really ought to be
replaced by a more subtle infinity-categorical version.
