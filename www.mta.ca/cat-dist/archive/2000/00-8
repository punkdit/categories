Here are a comment and a question regarding the interesting reality
check.

Peter Freyd wrote, among other things:

 > sequences of _signed_ binary digits, that is -1, 0, +1.

In a way, the finitary identities

      +1 -1  ==  0 +1  

together with their symmetric versions

      -1 +1  ==  0 -1  

capture *all* identifications made by the quotient map

     3^N  -->>  [-1, 1]

      s  |-->    [[s]] = s1 / 2  +  s2 / 4  + ... +  sn / 2^n + ... 

that takes a signed-digit binary expansion s to the number [[s]] that
it denotes. Here 3 = {-1,0,+1}, and I am supposing initially that
[-1,1] is already given.

Let === be the kernel of the quotient map:

     s === t  iff [[s]] = [[t]].

Let == be the least equivalence relation on 3^N such that

     s +1 -1 t == s 0 +1 t
and
     s -1 +1 t == s 0 -1 t,

where s ranges over 3^* and t over 3^N. 

It is easy to see that == is coarser than ===.  It is *strictly*
coarser as, for example, we have that

	-1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... === 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ..., 

because both sequences denote the number zero, but === cannot be
replaced by ==, because these two sequences cannot be made equal by
finitely many applications of the identities.

HOWEVER, if one endows 3^N with the Cantor topology (the product of
the discrete topology of 3), then the relation === is the topological
closure of the relation == in the product space 3^N x 3^N. 
That is, all we need to do in order to get === from == is to add
limits. 

Thus, === can be defined in a topologico-combinatorial way *without*
reference to a previously existing interval [-1,1]. Therefore we have
a simple direct (classical) construction of the Euclidean interval
[-1,1] as a topological quotient of 3^N by an easily defined
equivalence relation of finite character.

(NB. Of course, === has to be closed, because [-1,1] is Hausdorff and
the semantic map is continuous (and hence a topological quotient map,
as it is a surjection of compact Hausdorff spaces). Thus, another way
of putting the above is to say that == fails to be === only by failing
to be closed.)

Moreover, there is a *computable* idempotent function 

	  f : 3^N x 3^N --> 3^N x 3^N 

with the property that if f(s,t)=(s',t') then 

     (1) s===s', t===t' and

     (2) if s===t then s' = t' 

            (Yes, I mean this; s' and t' are the *same* sequence.)

As this may sound puzzling at first sight, let me observe that it
doesn't help in effectively deciding equality, nor does it show that
numbers would have canonical representatives, because norm(s,s)=(s,s)
is consistent with the above specification.

Such a function f(s,t) is computed by a finite automaton that tries to
apply the two identities to make s and t equal, by scanning longer and
longer finite prefixes of s and t, where this attempt fails at some
finite stage if and only if s and t denote distinct numbers.  At most
n+2 digits of input have to be scanned in order to produce n digits of
output.

via infinite signed-digit numerals", Volume 13 of Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science, 1998.)

Question:

Can we replace topology by coinduction in the formulations (and
proofs) of the above properties?

It's happening at last! As you will know from one of Peter Freyd's recent
postings on this bulletin board, the mathematicians in Cambridge are in the
process of moving to the new Centre for Mathematical Sciences in
Clarkson Road, next to the Isaac Newton Institute. From *12 September 2000*,
our postal address will be

DPMMS,
Centre for Mathematical Sciences, 
Wilberforce Road,
Cambridge CB3 0WB,
U.K.

(replacing the 16 Mill Lane address with which many of you will be familiar).

Please note that, although the new building is familiarly referred to as
`Clarkson Road' (and the main pedestrian access is indeed from Clarkson Road),
the Post Office regard it as being in Wilberforce Road because they will be
delivering mail from that side. (Also, for those who care about such things,
the `0' in the postcode is a zero, not a capital `Oh'.)

Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses will remain unchanged, although there
may be some short-term disruption to both during the actual move.

I am pleased to report that my book

	Practical Foundations of Mathematics
	Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics 59
	Cambridge University Press, 1999
	ISBM 0 521 63107 6

has sold enough copies (not too sure how many that is) to warrant a reprint.

I have been asked to send any [minor] corrections by 18 August,
which is really rather short notice.

If you have any notes of spelling mistakes, broken sentences, wrong firstnames,
wrong fonts or whatever, please send them to me as soon as possible.

Obviously I also want to know if there are mathematical errors, but it will
probably only be possible to change a small amount of text on this occasion.
(However, judging by the experience with "Proofs and Types", it is likely
to be another ten years before I get the opportunity to make substantial
changes.)

The full text of the narrative of the book (with only the simplest parts of
the mathematics) is available on the web in HTML at
	http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations

Some of you got your copies by a special arrangement with Richard Knott at CUP
in March last year.   I heard some rumours that not all of the orders that
were made in that way were actually fulfilled.    If you sent an order to
Richard but didn't get your copy, please tell me.

I can't answer Andrej's questions, but I can make a few
observations.

In base Golden Ratio with digits 0 and 1 (proposed by Pietro Di
Gianantonio), the family of identities that generates === is

   ... 100 ... === ... 011 ... 

It corresponds to the fact that the Golden Ratio is the positive
solution of the equation x^2 = x + 1.

    (i.e. 1 x^2 + 0 x^1 + 0 x^0 = 0 x^2 + 1 x^1 + 1 x^0)
          =       =       =       =       =       =

What I have reported about signed-digit binary notation has also been
developed for Golden-Ratio notation by David McGaw in his Honours
project ( http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~mhe/macgaw.ps.gz ).  You may be
able to get a finite automaton from his algorithm for solving the word
problem. It should be even simpler than the one for signed binary,
because there are fewer cases to consider.

 >                             I

This is precisely what the Golden-Ratio notation achieves.

The interval I is now [0,phi], where phi is the Golden Ratio.

Then the "digit maps" are l(x)=(x+0)/phi and r(x)=(x+1)/phi.

The intersection of the images of l and r is a closed interval with
non-empty interior, as in your picture. 

The above family of identities is equivalent to the single equation
l o r o r = r o l o l.

One could try to consider algebras with two operations and this
equation in order to get the interval in a more constructive way.

I just returned from an idyllic island in the Adriatic sea, so I am
joining the discussion on the reals a bit late.

Jesse Hughes and I have thought about some of the questions that have
been discussed so far in February, and I would like to report on what
we had come up with.


1.

Martin Escardo asked whether it is possible to define the signed
binary digit representation of [-1,1] in purely coinductive form. This
can be done as follows (I am using Martin's notation for === and [[s]]).

Let 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = {-1, 0, 1}, and let C be the final coalgebra for
the functor X |--> 3 x X. If the ambient category is nice enough C is
the Cantor space 3^N, but we stick to purely coinductive language and
think of elements of C as streams. Since C is the final coalgebra for
X |--> 3 x X, every stream in C can be written uniquely in the form
h::t where h is the "head" digit and t is the "tail" of the stream.

The question is how to define the coincidence relation === on C
without reference to the closed interval. The right person to ask this
was Michal Konecny <konecny@rect.muni.cz>, a student of Achim Jung's,
who studied what functions on real numbers can be computed by finite
state automata (he also knows very well what exactly can be computed
with finite state automata---there seems to be a close relation to
f.s.a. and coinductive definitions). He immediately came up with a
finite state automaton that accepts the negation of ===, from which a
coinductive definition of === can be obtained easily. Michal produced
pretty pictures that you can see at http://andrej.com/michal.ps

The trick is to define === together with an auxiliary relation ~==.
The intended meaning of s ~== t is [[s]] = 1/2 + [[t]]. It goes as
follows:

 x::a === y::b  <==>    (x=y, a === b) or
                        (x=1, y=-1, a=-1-1-1..., b=111...) or
                        (x=-1, y=1, a=111..., b=-1-1-1...) or
                        (x=0, y=1, a ~== b) or
                        (x=-1,y=0, a ~== b) or
                        (x=1, y=0, b ~== a) or
                        (x=0, y=-1, b ~== a)

 and

 x::a ~== y::b  <==>    (x=1, y=-1, a ~== b) or
                        (x=0, y=-1, a ~== b) or
                        (x=1, y=0, a ~== b) or

Now let I be the quotient of C by ===. If the category is rich enough
we can show that I is the closed interval of Cauchy reals.

It would be interesting to simplify this presentation even further by
using a signed representation with digits -1 and 1 only, in base B
strictly between 1 and 2. For example, the golden ratio base B = (1 +
sqrt(5))/2 seems to be very popular among exact real arithmetic
people. But it's unclear how to make a finite state automaton for
negation of === in this case.


2.

Alex Simpson suggested that we should look for what he calls
"pseudo-ordering" instead of the classical "linear ordering". I
definitely agree with that. I would just like to say that in my view
it is better to say "(intuitionistic) linear order" than
"pseudo-order" since the three axioms (by the way, there is no need to
explicitly quantify over z in the second axiom, is there?)

  1. not (x < y and y < x)

  2. x < y ==> (x < z or z < y)

  3. (not (x < y or y < x)) ==> x = y

are classically equivalent to the usual axioms for linear order, as
far as I can tell. So there is nothing "pseudo-" about the axioms,
unless intuitionistic logic is "pseudo-logic"...

I also agree with Alex that gluing along a point is not the right
thing to do, from a constructive/intuitionistic point of view.


3.

Lastly, let me suggest another construction which Jesse and I have
come up with, but we are unable to verify whether it works. Perhaps
someone who does not get confused so quickly by too many arrows can
tell us if it is worth anything.

We were thinking like this. Consider the construction described by
Peter Freyd, where we take objects with distinguished elements 0 and 1.
We require that not (0 = 1) and then we define a "gluing functor"
X |--> X v X which identifies 0 from one copy of X with 1 in the other
copy of X. Then it turns out that (classically) the final coalgebra
for the gluing functor is the closed interval I. This construction
does not work in the intuitionistic case because gluing along a single
point is a very classical construction. For an intuitionistic
construction we should glue along an interval so that we have some
"numerical tolerance". This leads to the idea that we should think of
the closed interval I as being glued like this:

             I
      |------------|--R--|
                   |--L--|------------|
                            I

That is, we replace the notion of "bottom 0" and "top 1" with "left
part L" and "right part R". In categorical language, the global points
0: * ---> I and 1: * ---> I are replaced with regular subspaces
L: I >--> I and R: I >--> I. So the obvious thing to attempt is to
consider objects X with distinguished "right part R: X >--> X" and
"left part L: X >--> X". However, this doesn't work because when we form 
the pushout

          R
      X >----> X
      V        V
    L |        |
      |       _|
      V      | V
      X -----> Y

we are stuck since we don't know how to obtain the left and right
parts of Y (they should be regular monos Y >--> Y). But we can fix
this by removing the condition that the left and the right part be
isomorphic to the whole, which gives us the following construction:

As objects we take pairs of parallel regular monos

    >--R-->
  X >--L--> Y

We think of R as the "right part of Y" and L as the "left part of Y".
There is an obvious notion of morphism between such objects
R,L: X >--> Y and R',L': X' >--> Y', namely a pair of arrows x: X ---> X'
and y: Y ---> Y' such that the following two diagrams, folded into a single
picture, commute:

      >--R-->
    X >--L--> Y
    |         |
  x |         | y
    |         |
    V         V
    X'>--R'-> Y'
      >--L'->

Define the gluing functor which maps such an object R,L: X ---> Y to the
object R',L': Y ---> Z where Z, L', and R' appear in the pushout diagram:

          R
      X >----> Y
      V        V
    L |        | L'
      |       _|
      V      | V
      Y -----> Z
          R'

We probably have to require that R and L are distinct regular monos
(just like we required that 0 and 1 are distinct, and they were
regular monos for free). We also have to assume that pushouts of
regular monos along regular monos are regular monos.

Question: does this functor have a final coalgebra, say in the
category of sets? How about in a topos with natural numbers object?

Observe that if there is a final coalgebra, then it is necessarily of
the form R, L: I >--> I, the left and the right parts are isomorphic
to the whole, because the structure map of a final coalgebra is an
isomorphism. So this much at least works out fine.

I have a feeling that the construction won't work, which is not bad
anyway, since the midpoint construction together with the completness
axiom of Alex's and Martin's works beautifully. I am just curious to
see what the final coalgebra might be.

Martin writes:

>  > [Discussion about intuitionistic versions of Freyd's construction

So, in response to that aspect:

Peter's motivation was to capture the signed binary interval rather 
than the binary one, a distinction that only exists in an 
intuitionistic setting. For (at least) this reason, his original 
definition was already intuitionistic (indeed his axioms were 
explicitly formulated in an intuitionistically appropriate form). 
The point I was making was that, given that one is already being 
sensitive to intuitionistic formulations, one also needs to be
equally careful about other aspects of the axiomatization (e.g. 
the definition of a suitable category of ordered sets). I was
curious to know which of the (apparently many) possible alternative 
definitions Peter had in mind.

It seems to me eminently plausible that Peter's construction works 
perfectly for the previously discussed intuitionistic linear orderings 
(I agree with Andrej about terminology - I took my terminology 
"pseudo ordering" from Peter Aczel). In fact, I would expect it to give 
the closed interval of Dedekind reals in any elementary topos with nno.
(Peter's proof that one obtains the signed-binary = Cauchy interval does 
indeed appear to use number-number choice.) I think that would be
a very nice result.

Peter, is this the sort of thing you're aiming at?

Peter Freyd's constructive version of his description of (a closed interval in)
the reals as a final coalgebra, posted on this network on 31 July, in fact
constructs (a closed interval in) the Dedekind reals in any topos with NNO.
Peter's attempt to show using signed binary expansions that his construction
produces the Cantor (or Cauchy) reals doesn't work, unless you assume countable
dependent choice (in which case, of course, the Cantor reals coincide with the
Dedekind reals).

The proof has two parts. First you have to show that a closed interval in the
Dedekind reals is a coalgebra for Peter's ordered-wedge functor (for which the
structure map is an isomorphism). This is not completely trivial, because in
Peter's description of the `thick' ordered wedge

     XvY = { <x,y> | ((x < T) => (B = y)) and ((B < y) => (x = T)) }

the strict order-relation (x < y) that he uses is simply the negation of 
(y \leq x): thus, in the Dedekind reals, it is the double-negation closure of
what we usually think of as the strict order-relation. However, it doesn't
matter, because in the Dedekind reals the assertions (B = y) and (x = T) are
double-negation stable (equality being the negation of apartness), and thus the
assertions

     ((x < T) => (B = y))     and    (\neg\neg(x < T) => (B = y))

(where `<' now denotes the `real' strict order relation) have the same
truth-value for any x and y. Using this, it's easy to see that (for example)
the ordered wedge [-1,0] v [0,1] is isomorphic to [-1,1], via the maps

     <x,y> |-> x + y      and     z |-> <min(z,0),max(z,0)>  .

Note that this already tells us that the final coalgebra can't be the Cantor
reals, because if it were, then in a topos (e.g. sheaves on a locally connected
space) where the Cantor and Dedekind reals are different we would have a
retraction from Dedekind to Cantor --- which surely doesn't exist.

Now, given a coalgebra

     <d,u>: X --> XvX  ,

we have to produce a mapping from X to (say) the Dedekind interval [-1,1]. 
We do this in exactly the way that Peter tried to construct a signed binary
expansion, except that we use the output of Peter's three-state machine to
produce a pair of sets of (dyadic) rationals rather than a sequence of digits.
(The reason why it won't do the latter is its non-determinism: for any natural
number n, it will produce a nonempty set of sequences of length n, and any
sequence of length n can be extended to a sequence of length n+1, but (without
dependent choice) that's not enough to ensure that it will produce a nonempty
set of *infinite* sequences. But non-determinism doesn't matter if you're
simply trying to construct two sets of rationals: if you get positive answers
to two questions, telling you to put different rationals into your sets, you
simply obey both instructions.)

Thus the idea is that, given an element x of our coalgebra, we construct
the pair of sets <L,U> as follows: we ask the three questions

     "B < ux?"
     "B < udx and dux < T?"
     "dx < T?"

knowing that our machine will produce a positive answer to at least one of
these questions. If the answer to the first is yes, we put 0 (and all rationals
less than it) into L, if the answer to the second is yes we put -1/2 into L and
+1/2 into U, and if the third is yes we put 0 into U. Keep going in this way,
and define L and U to be the unions of the sequences of sets you construct. We
have to show that the result really is a Dedekind real, of which the only
interesting bit is showing that it satisfies the positive version

     ((q < r) => ((q \in L) or (r \in U)))

of the `zero distance apart' condition. Given q and r, we know an n such that
2^{-n} < r - q, and we know that running our machine for n+2 steps will pin
down x to an interval of length 2^{-n}. So we simply run the machine for this
length of time, and look to see where we've got to.

Of course, we also have to show that the map (f,say) defined by this procedure
is the unique coalgebra homomorphism from X to [-1,1]. But this is easy, given
that equality of Dedekind reals is a negative statement: given a (putative)
other such map g, all we have to do is assume (fx < gx) for some x \in X and
derive a contradiction. And if fx < gx, we can find a dyadic rational q which
separates them; then we run our machine until it has assured us that fx < q,
and derive a contradiction to the assumption that g is order-preserving (and
commutes with d and u).

Aside: one thing that bothered me (and, I believe, people in Edinburgh) about
Peter's construction was its use of the `negative' strict order relation: since
we know that the positive strict order on the reals is the one that really
matters, why doesn't it appear in the definition? Well, it doesn't; but you can
define it purely in terms of the coalgebra structure: x < y iff there is some
finite sequence of d's and u's that takes x to B and y to T. (Proving from
first principles that this yields a transitive relation on the final coalgebra
is an interesting exercise.)

Is there some way in which CUP could be convinced to reprint some
copies of Kelly's book "Basic Concepts of Enriched Category
Theory"? I'm sure there would be a huge demand for it.

          Special volume for CT200

The journal "Theory and Applications of Categories" has agreed to
publish a special volume dedicated to work presented at the
International Conference on Category Theory CT2000, held in Como, in
July. CT2000 intended to present work in all areas of category
theory and its applications, but particularly in the following areas:

   * topos theory and synthetic differential geometry,
   * algebraic topology and homological algebra,
   * enriched category theory and 2-dimensional universal algebra,
   * higher dimensional category theory and quantum algebra,
   * categorical logic,
   * galois theory and descent,
   * categories and computer science,
   * general category theory.

We invite each participant who offered a scientific contribution 
(a talk or a poster) at the conference to submit a complete version of that
work. All papers submitted will undergo the usual TAC referee process.
Papers will appear as soon as they are accepted. All papers accepted will
appear in the same volume of TAC which we hope will be completed
 before end of 2001. The TAC home page is at the URL

http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/ .

The submission deadline for the special issue is November 30, 2000.

Title : From concurrency to algebraic topology

Author : Philippe Gaucher 

Email : gaucher@math.u-strasbg.fr

Abstract : This paper is a survey of the new notions and results
scattered in "Homotopy invariants of higher dimensional categories and
concurrency in computer science", "Combinatorics of branchings in
higher dimensional automata", " About the globular homology of higher
dimensional automata".  Starting from a formalization of higher
dimensional automata (HDA) by strict globular $\omega$-categories, the
construction of a diagram of simplicial sets over the three-object
small category $-\leftarrow gl\rightarrow +$ is exposed. Some of the
properties discovered so far on the corresponding simplicial homology
theories are explained, in particular their links with geometric
problems coming from concurrency theory in computer science.

it's no surprise to find him engrossed in Hirotaka Tamanoi's Elliptic

ERRATA TO    "PRACTICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS"

I would like to thank   David Benson,  Peter Johnstone,  Thomas Streicher
and  Krzysztof Worytkiewicz  for their comments in response to my request
for corrections.  If you know of any other mistakes, please tell me ASAP.

First, I apologise to Heinrich Kleisli, Dito Pataraia, Maria Cristina
Pedicchio, Dietmar Schumacher and V. Z\"oberlein for my mistakes in
their names on pages 179, 403, 533, 540, 563, 566 and 572.

Only one actual falsity has come to my attention:  exactly a year after
I got the first copy of the book, Thomas sent me a simple counterexample
to the claim that fibrations preserve pullbacks (Exercise 9.4, page 523).

I am very pleased at how few errors have shown up in 17 months, and how
trivial they are.   This is a tribute to the care that nearly 40 people
took in reading individual chapters of the book.  Though I am sure that
this policy of only sending out single chapters irritated the people in
question, it did prove to be a very successful way of ensuring that the
entire book got careful and reasonably even attention. In contrast, the
most assiduous reader of "Proofs and Types"  only got two thirds of the
way through the book, starting from the beginning.

You may like to read Peter Johnstone's review for the Zentralblatt at
   http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/Johnstone-review.html
(it's on my web site because it's unreadable on the Zentralblatt site).

There is an 18 page summary of the contents of the book at
   http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/summary.dvi
   http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/html/summary.html
The DVI version is intended for you to print, the HTML one for linking
into the full text of the narrative that's also on the web.

The bibliography is available as a BibTeX file at
   http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/prafm-ref.bib

I understand that 1000 copies were printed in March 1999, of which 825
had been sold when I asked last week, and 400 new ones are to be printed.
For over seven years' work, I have had about 3000 pounds in royalties
and no permanent job.



SIGNIFICANTLY WRONG SYMBOLS AND WORDS

p. 37, Lemma 1.6.3, proof box, line 6:
should be \exists y.\gamma\land\phi[y] in the left-hand box.

p. 144, intro to Section 3.5, and p. 176, Exercise 3.19:
the sum of posets or dcpos (not domains).
  
p. 275, final paragraph of Definition 5.5.1: if c then ... (not a).
  
p. 285 Corollary 5.6.12: v(y)=x_1, not u_y=x_1.

p. 290, diagram for Lemma 5.7.6(e):
(German) f;m and z;n instead of f;n and z;m.

p. 362, Exercise 6.23:
T\Theta instead of T(\Gamma\times\Theta) at the top right of the diagram.

p. 397, introduction to Section 7.5: \mu = U\epsilon F.

p. 519, Proposition 9.6.13 [c=>a]: The infinitary version of
Example 2.1.7, rather than of its converse {Exercise 2.14).

The full list of actual changes (including broken sentences and places where
inserting a couple of extra words could improve understandability) is at
   http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~pt/Practical_Foundations/errata.html



REMARKS ON OTHER POINTS THAT I FEEL I UNDERSTAND BETTER SINCE PUBLICATION

The Substitution Lemma (1.1.5, p. 7) correctly forbids x to be free in a,
because the substitution  [a/x]^*u  is meant to result in a term that
doesn't involve x. See Definition 4.3.11(b) for why.  Arguably, contexts
should be emphasised from the start, especially as, in this book, they turn
into the objects of the classifying category.  That the proof of the
Substitution Lemma tolerates  x  being free in  a  entirely misses the
point,  and merely illustrates the tyranny of notation over concepts

In his review, Peter Johnstone teased me for Exercise 1.1 (Bo Peep's theorem).
To add fuel to his fire, I now think that the natural proof of this -
the very earliest theorem in mathematics - is essentially the argument
needed for the Schr\"oder-Bernstein theorem.  It would be nice to be able
to get an anthropologist to understand that this *is* a significant theorem,
and to try to find out at what stage in the development of human cultureS
it was learned.

p. 358, Remark 6.7.14: It is probably true in the concrete case of
ordinals in Pos and Set that a sh-coalgebra is well founded in the
sense of Definition 6.3.2 iff  <  is a well founded relation
(Definition 2.5.3).  Inability to formulate the abstract result for
ordinals in categories between which there is an adjunction  F -| U
is the reason why I have not finished [Tay96b].

p. 502, Example 9.4.11(d): The closed point of the Sierpi\'nski space
does classify closed subsets intuitionistically.   Any point of this
space can be expressed as the join of a directed diagram taking only
\bot and \top as values, whilst (the dual of) the equation in Exercise
9.57 characterises support classifiers [Tay98].

Section 9.4: Beware that, whilst my approach to the Beck-Chevalley
condition does ensure that pullbacks of  >---|>-maps  are  >---|>-maps,
such pullbacks do not always exist in the category of locally compact spaces.

Since (as far as we are aware) nobody else has plans to organize a
meeting of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic this autumn,
we are proposing to hold the 73rd PSSL in Cambridge on the weekend
of 4/5 November 2000. (This will also provide an opportunity for
anyone who hasn't been in Cambridge recently to see our new
Mathematics building.)

Further details, including a registration form, will be sent out in
late September/early October.

From: Osher Doctorow, Ph.D. osher@ix.netcom.com, Mon. Aug. 14, 2000, 11:25PM

Dear Colleagues:

The quantity 1 - x + y which I introduced earlier to categories@mta.ca , and
which is the non-trivial case of Lukaciewicz implication as well as the
logic-based probability (LBP) probability of the set/event analogue of the
logical conditional Pr(A-->B) = 1 - Pr(A) + Pr(AB) for x = Pr(A), y =
Pr(AB), has an interesting invariance property.  I will use the LBP
formulation to show this.  Consider two sets A and B, possibly intersecting.
The universe is then divided into A U B (the union of A, B) and its
complement which is (A U B)' = A' B'  where intersection is indicated by
adjacent letters such as A' B' (which is the intersection of A' and B').
However, A U B is the union of AB and the part of B that does not intersect
A (which is BA') and the part of A which does not intersect B (which is
AB').   Thus the universe is the union of the disjoint (mutually exclusive
and exhaustive) sets AB', AB, A'B, and A'B'.

Lemma.  Pr(A-->B) = 1 - Pr(A) + Pr(AB)  =  Pr(B) + Pr(A' B' )

Proof.  The first equality has been established several weeks ago in my
contribution.  The second equality is true iff the equality with Pr(A) added
to both sides and Pr(AB) subtracted from both sides is true, but that
equation is the same as 1 = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(AB) + Pr(A' B')  = Pr(A U B)
+ Pr(A U B)' .   The latter is true by the definition of complement.  Q.E.D.

What is the invariance property?   From the lemma, let us write Pr(A' B' )
as Pr(A U B)'  = 1 - Pr(A U B).  Then Pr(A-->B) = 1 - Pr(A) + Pr(AB) = 1 -
Pr(A U B) + Pr(B).   Therefore, for x and y as above, the conjugate of 1 - x
+ y, which is 1 - y + x, equals 1 plus the excess of Pr(A) over Pr(AB) which
equals 1 plus the excess of Pr(A U B) over Pr(B).   Since 1 - x + y and its
conjugate involve either the excess of x to y or its negative, and since
Pr(A-->B) is the probable influence of A on B, in words the invariance
property of 1 - x + y says that the probable influence of A on B involves
the excess of Pr(A) over Pr(AB) or equivalently the excess of Pr(A U B) over
Pr(B).  Now, AB does involve an extra symbol B concatenated (technically,
intersected here) with symbol A.  Also, A U B involves an extra symbol A
"unioned" or "united" with B. Thus, the "excess of symbols" parallels the
excess of probabilities for the pairs.  In a sense, the "set excess"
parallels the probability/measure excess (I could write this symbolically,
but I will not for now) across union and intersection - that is the
invariance of 1 - x + y.   In mathematical physics, this would be expressed
by saying that set union and set intersection can be exchanged or are
invariant under the symmetry - although the symmetry holds under very
specific conditions.   This terminology comes from symmetries in which
particles and antiparticles are exchanged, protons/neutrons/electrons are
exchanged, bosons and leptons are exchanged, left-handed and right-handed
particles are exchanged, etc.  These types of symmetries and others are
quite fundamental in mathematical physics.

 Of Flames, Fan Mail, and Software That Can Tell the Difference

By ELLEN SPERTUS

...

In the offline world, some people enjoy baiting others with
intentionally offensive behavior, then enjoying their reactions.
Online, this has become a sport called trolling for flames. Some
trolls lack subtlety, like the one posted to the cat lovers'
discussion group that asked for recipes for cooking cats.

But others are deliciously clever. For example, in response to a
discussion of the mystical and mathematical importance of ratios in
the Great Pyramid of Cheops, John Baez posted a note that the ancient
Greeks, too, were very sophisticated: If you take the ratio of the
circumference to the radius of the columns they built, he wrote, you
get an excellent approximation of pi. Gullible readers, not realizing
that Baez was a mathematics professor with a sense of humor, protested
that this was true of any circle. "That's what makes it so spooky,"
Baez cryptically replied, adding to the confusion.

CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

The International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR) is
the fusion of three major conferences in Automated Reasoning: CADE
(The International Conference on Automated Deduction), TABLEAUX (The
International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux
and Related Methods) and FTP (The International Workshop on
First-Order Theorem Proving). These three events will join for the
first time at the IJCAR conference in Siena in June 2001.

IJCAR 2001 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated
reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and
applications. Original research papers and descriptions of working
automated deduction systems are solicited.

Topics
------
LOGICS of interest include propositional, first-order, classical,
equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal,
temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, and meta-logics,
type theory and set theory.

TECHNIQUES of interest include model-elimination, tableaux, sequent
calculi, resolution, connection method, inverse method, term
rewriting, induction, unification, constraint solving, decision
procedures, model generation, model checking, semantic guidance,
interactive theorem proving, logical frameworks, and AI-related
methods for deductive systems such as proof planning and proof
presentation.

APPLICATIONS of interest include hardware and software development,
systems analysis and verification, functional and logic programming,
proof carrying code, deductive databases, knowledge representation,
computer mathematics, natural language processing, linguistics,
planning and other AI areas.


Submissions - Research papers and system descriptions
-----------------------------------------------------
Submitted research papers and system descriptions must be original and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Research papers can be up to
15 proceedings pages long, and system descriptions can be up to 5
pages long. The proceedings of IJCAR 2001 will be published by
Springer-Verlag in the LNAI series.

All submissions must be received by January 14, 2001. Submissions that
are late or too long or require substantial revision will not be
considered. Authors of accepted papers will be requested to sign a
form transfering copyright of their contribution to Springer-Verlag.

IN THE RESEARCH PAPER CATEGORY, SUBMISSIONS OF THEORETICAL, PRACTICAL
AND EXPERIMENTAL NATURE ARE EQUALLY ENCOURAGED.

Submissions - Short papers
--------------------------
Short papers are intended for quick dissemination of work in progress
or results not substantial enough for a full research paper. Their
length is limited to 10 pages. Submissions under this category will
not be formally refereed, but their content and relevance will be
reviewed. Those submissions accepted will be published in a technical
report, which will be available at the conference. Authors of accepted
papers are expected to present a brief outline of their work at the
conference and to prepare a poster for display at the conference
venue.

The submission deadline is April 2, 2001.

Submission details - All categories
-----------------------------------
Authors are strongly encouraged to use LATEX2e and the Springer llncs
class files. The primary means of submission is electronic. More
submission details can be found at the IJCAR 2001 web site.

Best Student Paper Award
------------------------
A prize of 500 Euros will be given to the best paper, as judged by the
program committee, written solely by one or more students. A
submission is eligible if all authors are full-time students at the
time of submission. This should be indicated in the submission
letter. The program committee may decline to make the award or may
split it among several papers.

CALL FOR TUTORIALS
==================

Scope
-----
It is planned to hold a number of tutorials within the technical
programme of the confer ence. We invite proposals for these tutorials
(as well as suggestions for topics that might be covered). The topics
of the tutorials can cover any area related to automated reasoning and
any related cross-disciplinary areas that might be of interest
(constraints, formal methods, ...). At present, the tutorials are
scheduled to take place on Monday 18th and Tuesday 19th June.

How to Propose a Tutorial 
-------------------------
Proposals should be in English and between one and two pages in
length. They should contain:

       * The title of the tutorial.                           
       * The names, and affiliations of the person or persons who will
         present the tutorial.
       * A brief technical description of the topics covered by the tutorial.
       * Contact details (email, web page, phone, fax, etc).
       * A list of tutorials previously given in this or related areas.

Proposals should be submitted electronically (in ASCII, Ghostscript
compatible Postscript or LaTeX) at the follwing address:

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS
==================

Scope
-----
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for
workshops on IJCAR related topics as mentioned in the "Call for
Papers". Proposals that promise to bring new topics into IJCAR, of
either practical or theoretical importance, or provide a forum for
more detailed discussion on central topics of continuing importance
are also welcomed. Workshops that close the gap between automated
reasoning and related areas, like for instance formal methods or
software engineering, are especially encouraged.

Recent workshops of participating conferences have included, for
instance, automated model building, automation of proofs by induction,
empirical studies in logic algorithms, mechanization of partial
functions, proof search in type-theoretic languages, strategies in
automated deduction, automated theorem proving in software engineering
and in mathematics, and integration of symbolic computation and
deduction.

Submission Details
------------------
Anyone wishing to organize a workshop in conjunction with IJCAR should
send in postscript format (e-mail preferred) a proposal no longer than
two pages to the workshop chair (ijcar-workshop@dii.unisi.it) by
January 1, 2001.

Proposals should consist of two parts. First, a short scientific
justification of the proposed topic, its significance and the
particular benefits of the workshop. A second part should include the
proposed format and agenda, the procedures for selecting papers and
participants, and contact information for the organizers. In
particular it should also include estimated dates for paper
submissions, acceptance of notification (before May 1, 2001) and
camera ready copy.

Proposals will be evaluated, and decisions will be communicated by
January 15, 2001. Further information about the arrangements for
workshops can be obtained from the IJCAR 2001 Web site.

BYLINE: R. Brown
BODY:

IT IS UNTRUE to say, as Geoff Poole does (Letters, 13 August), that
university maths courses have not changed in 30 years. It depends
where you go. Prospective students should look for courses in which a
project is a requirement for the final assessment; where the project
does allow for a "maths in context" flavour when desired; and in which
the evaluation of mathematical method is seen as a part of the whole
course. Such considerations are also essential for prospective
teachers.

Those of us who are working on raising public awareness of mathematics
believe it is essential to popularise it. It is an essential component
of high-technology because it allows for precision and hence deduction
and calculation. This kind of rigour may not be easy, but it makes
those who can do it very employable.

Homotopies and automorphisms of crossed modules of groupoids
ABSTRACT: We give a detailed description of the structure of the actor
2-crossed module related to the automorphisms of a crossed module of
groupoids. This generalises work of Brown and Gilbert for the case of
crossed modules of groups, and part of this is needed for work on
2-dimensional holonomy to be developed elsewhere.

Local subgroupoids II: Examples and properties
ABSTRACT: The notion of local subgroupoid as a generalisation of a local
equivalence relation was defined in a previous paper by the first two
authors. Here we use the notion of star path connectivity for a Lie
groupoid to give an important new class of examples, generalising the local
equivalence relation of a foliation, and develop in this new context basic
properties of coherence, due earlier to Rosenthal in the special case.
These results are required for further applications to holonomy and
monodromy.

[Note from moderator: apologies to the poster for the lengthy delay in

Is there some way in which CUP could be convinced to reprint some
copies of Kelly's book "Basic Concepts of Enriched Category
Theory"? I'm sure there would be a huge demand for it.

Max might want to look into the possiblity of taking back the
copyright if CUP no longer is interested - I know that Jim Lambek and
Mike Barr both had their books published by other publishers when
original ones no longer wanted to keep them in print.  (Jim used
Chelsea, which is no longer an option, but Mike used the CRM at U
Montreal, which certainly is - and there are no doubt other
possibilities, including some closer to (Max's) home.)  Of course, we
could just scan it and put it on the web, but that'd be illegal :-)

The following preprint is available:

M. Grandis, Exactness and stability in homotopical algebra,
Dip. Mat. Univ. Genova, Preprint 419 (2000)


Abstract. Exact sequences are a well known notion in homological algebra.
We investigate here the more vague properties of 'homotopical exactness',
appearing for instance in the fibre or cofibre sequence of a map.
   Such notions of exactness can be given for very general 'categories with
homotopies' having homotopy kernels and cokernels, but become more
interesting under suitable 'stability' hypotheses, satisfied - in
particular - by chain complexes. It is then possible to measure the default
of homotopical exactness of a sequence by the homotopy type of a certain
object, a sort of 'homotopical homology'.

	This is to correct some remarks I made at the History of Categories
meeting in Montreal in August, and to substantiate what I have written in
the on-line Encyclopedia Britannica entry on Saunders Mac Lane. Mac Lane
deserves credit for both the name "Abelian category" and the concept, in
his paper "Duality for groups" (BAMS 1950, 485-516). 

	Mac Lane 1950 defines "Abelian categories" in section III. He says an
"Abelian category" is a category with a generator and a cogenerator and
with zero object and biproducts (which he calls "free-and-direct products).
 He proves that in such a category, the arrows from any object A to another
B form an additive commutative monoid (he actually says "semigroup",
p.511); and that any such category is isomorphic to a category of
commutative monoids (p.512).

	Of course this is far from our current definition of Abelian categories.
But Mac Lane comes very close to the current definition with his "Abelian
bicategories" on p.513 (using terms from 503). The definition makes heavy
use of "submaps" and "supermaps". 

	First, let me simplify by taking "submaps" to be monics, and "supermaps"
to be epics. In these simplified terms Mac Lane's axioms for an "Abelian
bicategory" say it is an "Abelian category" such that every arrow has an
epic-monic factorization and:

LC-1 the subobjects of any object A form a complete lattice.

LC-2 sups of subobjects are preserved by direct images.

and furthermore:

ABC-1 The arrows from any A to another B form a commutative group.

ABC-3 every subobject is a kernel and dually.


These imply that every arrow has a kernel (sup of all subobjects killed by
the arrow) and dually.

Mac Lane's other axioms ABC-2 and ABC-4 and 5, are redundant in this
simplified case.

	So in this simplified form an "Abelian bicategory" for Mac Lane in
1950 is what we would call an Abelian category with generator and
cogenerator and with sups of subobjects (preserved by direct image). Mac
Lane talks about pre-images of sups also, in terms not exactly ours today,
and I have not worked out the connection.


	Now, to stop simplifying, Mac Lane's "submaps" and "supermaps" are not
defined but axiomatized. A category with submaps is a category with a
distinguished class of monics satisfying certain axioms (which imply that
every split monic is in the class, p.499). "Supermaps" are axiomatized
dually. And the axioms imply that every arrow has a "supermap-submap"
factorization.

	Actually the axioms begin with a much narrower class of selected monics
called "injections", and corresponding epics called "projections", such
that every arrow factors uniquely as a projection followed by an
isomorphism followed by an injection. The axioms pose further conditions,
apparently all based on the idea that injections should correspond to
certain set theoretic inclusions. I have not examined them closely.

	A submap is defined to be any isomorphism followed by an injection, and
dually for supermaps and projections.

	Clearly the motivation for using "submaps" rather than monics was
that Mac Lane hoped to extend this approach to include the category of all
groups, with normal monics as the "submaps". See the footnote on p.513
saying "proofs of the first and second isomorphism theorems for all groups
can be based on 'categorical' axioms".

	I think it fair to count this business of submaps and supermaps as an
inessential complication.

	Grothendieck radically simplified the axioms, extended them, and
found far more penetrating applications than Mac Lane had in mind in 1950.
I am sure Grothendieck did not know of Mac Lane's paper directly, and I
suspect that once he heard something like this was possible he worked it
out for himself. One key to Grothendieck's improvements is that
Grothendieck proceeds in more purely categorical terms. But the name and
the concept are from Mac Lane

I thought this would be a simple application of the snake lemma, but I
cannot do it all.  Does anyone know if it is true and, if not, why it is
true for tensor product?  Suppose X is an abelian category and T:X --> Ab
is a right exact functor.  Say an object E is T-effaceable if for every
exact sequence 0 --> A --> B --> E --> 0, the induced TA --> TB is
injective.  Now suppose that 0 --> E' --> E --> E'' --> 0 is an exact
sequence in which E and E'' are T-effaceable.  Does it follow that E' is?
Does it help if you suppose that every object has an effaceable cover (and
therefore an effaceable resolution)?  Then you could define homology, but
you want it independent of the resolution and that is where this question
actually comes from, trying to prove independence of resolution.
